<h>Re: Mobile Multimedia Messaging Service

<p>If there has been no charter proposed for a MMMS working group, I intend to pro
pose one as follows.  I would like to know how the Area Directors feel about th
e following ideas, many of which are informed by the comments of Patrik, Ned, a
nd others in the Apps Discussion archives
 

<p>Proposed MMMS working group purpose:  The MMMS working group
will produce a series of Internet-Drafts, and attempt to produce RFCs, describi
ng the use of end-to-end Internet multimedia messaging and related services on
mobile devices.  The specifications will concern application-level services as
well as general end-to-end Internet service specifications and lower-level serv
ices such as non-wireless serial PPP access from mobile devices.  No new protoc
ols will be created; only existing open Internet standards and protocols free f
romany intellectual property encumbrance will be incorporated into MMMS specifi
cations, along with specific implementation interoperability guidelines.

<p>Proposed special document status and process for MMMS specifications:  Recognizing tha
t it may be impossible to achieve consensus on topics in which large and divers
e corporate concerns have vested interests opposed to open standards, the MMMS
working group will have a special goal to produce Internet-Drafts which will id
entified as "Frozen MMMS RFC-track Internet-Drafts."  These documents might nev
er become RFCs because of an expected lack of consensus, but upon identificatio
n as such by the Working Group, they will be announced and archived as frozen d
ocuments.  Developers may rely on such documents as static and vendors and cust
omers will be encouraged to refer to them in their procurement process.  The le
vel of consensus required to designate Frozen MMMS RFC-track Internet-Drafts wi
ll be a simple majority of those working group participants who are not affilia
ted with organizations having direct or indirect financial interests in closed-
protocol mobile services.  Any member of the working group not affiliated with
organizations having direct or indirect financial interests in closed-protocol
mobile services may call a vote on the designation of any Internet-Draft as a F
rozen MMMS RFC-track Internet-Draft, and if after one week's time there are mor
e such MMMS WG participants in favor than dissenting, the WG Chair, the author
of the draft, or the participant calling the vote will then take steps to estab
lish a permanent archive of the draft and publish an announcement of its availa
bility to the IETF community.  Anyone affiliated with organizations having dire
ct or indirect financial interests in closed-protocol mobile services may not c
all a vote or vote on such special designation, but all participants will have
normal consensus rights in the traditional RFC process, and all Internet-Drafts
 must follow the existing IESG intellectual property disclosure process.  
 
 <p>Proposed milestones:  The goals of the MMMS WG will include the publication of speci
fications, as described above, on the following topics:  interoperable end-to-e
nd Internet service access on mobile devices, including descriptions of existin
g end-to-end wireless Internet service arrangements; implementation guidelines
for multimedia messaging services on mobile devices using existing Internet mes
saging standards; guidelines concerning performance implications of link constr
aints, including TCP behaviors during extended periods of wireless link downtim
e; and wired PPP access from mobile Internet devices.

<p>Jim Mathis:  Would you be interested in chairing a MMMS working group charted as described above?  Would
your organization's current apparent commitment to closed-protocol mobile messa
ging solutions make you an inappropriate chair for such a group?  If you would
not want to, or do not feel you would be an appropriate chair, I would voluntee
r to serve as an interim chair.

<p>Cheers,
<p>James> 

<p>At the November meeting, about 90
people attended the Mobile > Multimedia Messaging Service BOF:>>

th a lot of general agreement that the > status quo has some real problems.> >

<p>Has anyone started on a working group charter?> > 

<p>There needs to be an organized effort to provide explicit and > well-documented alternatives to the closed-p

 easy and reasonable mobile multimedia messaging services.  > I for one would c

working group.
