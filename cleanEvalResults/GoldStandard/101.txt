<h>"Bugs" in the 24 March 1999 Version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

<p>This memo highlights key "bugs" in the 24 March 1999 version of the "Web Conten
t Accessibility Guidelines." Additional bugs and suggestions are described in m
y revision of the 24 March 1999 guidelines document. The revision is available
(temporarily) at:


<p>Bug-1. The concept of "equivalent" is incomplete.Importance: ExtremeDescription: The
 overall concept of "equivalent" is probably the most important concept of the
document. Yet I believe that without the change, the concept of "equivalent" wi
ll remain vague.  Action Performed: Refined definition of "equivalent". Further Action
Suggested: Replace old language with new.Ease of Correction: Very easy===

<p>Bug-2. The definition of "equivalent" is incomplete without a concept of "communicati
on element".Importance: Extreme Description: I think that the concept of "commu
nication element" is very important. It has to encompass all the things listed
in checkpoint 1.1. The term communication element is an essential foundation fo
r the definition of equivalent. The term makes clear that we are not talking ab
out "HTML elements." Action Performed: Added a new term called the "communicati
on element". See the definition of "communication element":
I also replaced the p
hrase "non-text elements" with "non-text communication elements". I think that
this change is extremely important. I did this because (1) The former was and i
s undefined and the latter is now defined.; (2) Several of the things that were
 called non-text elements looked like "text" (scripts, ASCII art, etc.) so the
simple reference to "non-text elements" was confusing.Further Action Suggested:
 Add the provided definition to the glossary. Make a few related changes noted
in main revision.Ease of Correction: Very easy==

<p>Bug-3. The term "text equivalen
t" is vaguely defined.Importance: ExtremeDescription: This is probably the most
 important refinement of the revision. The characteristic of being able to be r
endered in several different ways - auditorially (synthesized speech), tactuall
y (braille), and visually (visually-displayed text) -- was mentioned in the pre
vious 3/24/99 version (in the body of the document but not the definition of te
xt equivalent). But this revision makes the feature the one that distinguishes
it from non-text equivalents. (A parallel contrast is found in the new distinct
ion between "text communication elements" and "non-text communication elements.
") If this cannot be addressed editorially, then I ask that it be discussed on
the list or wherever else necessary.Action Performed: Refined the definition of
 "text equivalent". See the definition of text equivalent:Further Action Suggested: Re
place old language with new in the glossary and make a few other changes as ind
icated in the revision.Ease of Correction: Very easy==

<p>Bug-4. The term "non-text
 equivalent" is improperly defined.Importance: ExtremeDescription: This is anot
her very important refinement. Essentially, a non-text equivalent is an "equiva
lent" that it is not a "text equivalent." The previous definition of non-text e
quivalent did not provide such a clear distinction. If this cannot be addressed
 editorially, then I ask that it be discussed on the list or wherever else nece
ssary.Action Performed: Revised the definition of "non-text equivalent". Furth
er Action Suggested: Replace old language with new in the glossary and make a f
ew other changes as indicated in the revision.Ease of Correction: Very easy==

<p>Bug-5. The term "alternative equivalent" is redundant.Importance: HighDescription
: I eliminated the term "alternative" from the term "alternative equivalent" si
nce the latter phrase is redundant. "Equivalent" is adequate by itself. Also, t
he term is "alternative" is not defined, except by context. (The word "alternat
ive" seems fine in other usage.)Action Performed: Removed the "alternative" fro
m the term "alternative equivalent"Further Action Suggested: Make edits as prov
ided.Ease of Correction: Very easy==

<p>Bug-6. Document uses of the word "descripti
on" without making clear its special meaning.Importance: HighDescription: The r
evision reduced reliance on undefined terms such a "video description", "audito
ry description"; these terms will tend to confuse people, especially if they ar
e not defined in the glossary. They are not, to my knowledge, necessary. I trie
d the use defined terms and to get the same message across. For example, I foun
d that the defined terms "equivalent" was often helpful. Action Performed: Redu
ced reliance on undefined uses of the word "description"Further Action Suggeste
d: Make edits as provided. Ease of Correction: Very easy==

<p>Bug-7. The introducti
on to guideline 1 is inconsistent with the refined definitions.Importance: High
 Description: NAAction Performed: Provided a revised introductory section for g
uideline 1 to make it consistent with the revised definitions above. Further
 Action Suggested: Use the provided language.Ease of Correction: Very easy==
 
 <p>Bug-8. Checkpoint 1.1 needs refinement. Importance: ExtremeDescription: Note that
is recently underwent a revision and therefore might be expected to require som
e editing. As noted, the reference to "synthesized speech" as requiring a "text
 equivalent" would not be comprehensible without further explanation. Action Pe
rformed: Revised the wording of checkpoint 1.1Further Action Suggested: Make the provided changes. Note tha
t any reference to "synthesized speech" as a non-text communication element wou
ld need to be explained if the group feels that it is important to include.Ease
 of Correction: Moderately easy. Should be reviewed by several members of the w
orking group. There are a few questions raised that should be addressed.==

<p>Bug-9. Checkpoint 14.2 mistakenly makes reference to equivalents "to text".Importanc
e: ExtremeDescription: This is a clear factual error.Action Performed: Provided
 revised wording. (I also made other edits that should be considered.) Further Actio
n Suggested: Make the provided changes.Ease of Correction: Very easy.==

<p>Bug-10.
The possibility of synchronizing text equivalents for video was not acknowledge
d in checkpoint 1.3Importance: Very HighDescription: The old version of 1.3 rea
ds: "For each movie, provide an auditory description of the video track and syn
chronize it with the audio track. [Priority 1]"Action Performed: Revised checkp
oint 1.3 and gave it a split priority.Further Action Suggested: Easy. This one should be re
viewed and discussed. The idea proposed was discussed briefly but received inad
equate consideration.Ease of Correction: Easy.==

<p>Bug-11. The word "visual" is us
ed to describe non-text elements, even though text is usually rendered in a vis
ual manner.Importance: ModerateDescription: NAAction Performed: Reduced relianc
e on the word "visual". Generally, I have tried to reduce reliance on the word
"visual" when referring to things like graphics and video. The problem is that
it is sometimes intended as a contrast to text, yet text can also be "visual."
If the editors think that it is important to use the visual, I recommend that t
hey define it early in the body of the document.Further Action Suggested: Make
provided changes.Ease of Correction: Easy==

<p>Bug-12. The need for text equivalent
s for ASCII art was cited in two checkpoints (1.1 and 1.5).Importance: HighDesc
ription: This is a small redundancy in the checkpoints.Action Performed: Delete
d Checkpoint 1.5 Further Action Suggested: Make suggested deletion.Ease of Correction: Very
Easy==

<p>Bug-13. The description of the relationship between the terms "assistive
technology", "screen reader", and "user agent" is not consistent throughout the
 document.Importance: HighDescription: This is a fairly clear factual mismatch.
 Action Performed: I have not tried to resolve this. Further Action Suggested: Th
e editors should pick one explanation and use it throughout the document.Ease o
f Correction: Easy.==

<p>Bug-14. The guidelines document does not claim a conforman
ce level.Importance: HighDescription: The guidelines document does not claim a
conformance level for itself.Action Performed: Added a conformance claim. Furt
her Action Suggested: Review and approve language.Ease of Correction: Fairly ea
sy. This should be reviewed by Working Group members.==

<p>Bug-15. The document fails to follow checkpoint 4.2 on acronyms and abbreviations. Importance: High (es
sential for obtaining triple-A rating).Description: NAAction Performed: Problem
 noted. One or more acronyms were expanded in the body of the text. Also anothe
r example was suggested. Further Action Suggested: Fix them. I think that i
t would be an important lost opportunity to fail to claim a triple-A rating and
 do whatever it takes to make sure that it sticks.Ease of Correction: Fairly ea
sy to somewhat difficult==

<p>Bug-16. The document does not say how to handle confo
rmance ratings for inaccessible primary pages that have accessible alternative
pages.Importance: Moderate to HighDescription: NAAction Performed: Provided an
explanation. Further Action Suggested: Verify that this is the desired location f
or this information. Approve.Ease of Correction: Easy==========================
