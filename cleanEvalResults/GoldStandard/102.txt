<p> While I think this is doubtlessly true; since we can transfo
rm any triples   diagram into sexpressions and visa versa without loss (can't w
e?); it would   seem to me that there is an advantage in thir simplicity.  Of c
ourse, the   enthusiasm for the triples in the community at large is also an ad
vantage,   imho.

<p>There is no problem with considering triples as S-expressions.
 Theproblem is considering them as S-expressions *and* as a formaldescriptive l
anguage simultaneously.

<p>Suppose someone suggests the use of Unicode as a formal
language, alongthe following lines.  Let the letter "l" stand for "lives in."
Let"W" stand for George W. Bush.  Let "D" stand for Washington, D.C.Let "T" sta
nd for Tony Blair, and "L" for London.  Let "t" stand for`taller than.'  And so
 forth.  Make sure every printing character isassigned a meaning.  Now take any
 string and divide it into groups ofthree characters, and assign to "pqr" the m
eaning "the relationdenoted by p holds between the object denoted by q and the
objectdenoted by r."  The whole string then stands for the conjunction ofthe pr
opositions denoted by the letter triples.  So the string"lWDlTLtTW" means "Geor
ge W. Bush lives in Washington, D.C., TonyBlair lives in London, and Tony Blair
 is taller than George W. Bush."Call this scheme URF, for "Unicode Representati
on Format."  

<p>Now suppose I argue that URF isn't a very powerful language, forre
asons that I hardly need to enumerate.  It would be frustrating ifthe pro-URF f
action comes back with the rejoinder, "What do you mean,it isn't very powerful?
  You can represent *anything* in Unicode, can'tyou?  Isn't it useful to have a
 `common exchange protocol'?"
 
 <p>This may sound like a parody, but to me statements such as this one bySeth seem to be of exactly this type:   
 
 <p>Inferencing is an application that sits on top of the triples ... let the   best one win.  I fail
to see how this is an argument against simply using   triples.

<p>In my URF world,couldn't I say   

<p>Inferencing is an application that sits on top of the Unicode
... let the best one win.  I fail to see how this is an argument against simply
 using Unicode.
 
 <p>The point is that no one is arguing against using Unicode or RDF
 as acoding scheme; the argument is against using either as a formallanguage.
If RDF is simply an encoding scheme, then we can put it onthe back burner and f
ocus on the language actually being encoded.  If we view it *as a formal langua
ge*, then its flaws loom large.  Itlacks many key features, including implicati
on and bound variables.

<p>Actually, I am not convinced that it's such a great enco
ding scheme.I am told it goes beyond XML in some important ways, but I'm not su
rewhat they are.

they often border on being simply incompetent.   

<p>Hey man! ...then give us a hand ...

<p>As I have argued before, I don't think it would be particularlydifficult t
o fix the problems with RDF.  However, fixing them wouldrequire thinking of an
RDF expression as a self-contained textualobject, which seems to be incompatibl
e with thinking of it as a pieceof a graph, and therefore incompatible with the
 triples model.  Ithink this is where we're stuck.
