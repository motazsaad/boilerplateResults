<h>Still bored.

<p>1113

<p>Think they just called my name. Go to counter 13. Lady standing in front of me. Turns out it wasn't my name. Not even close. Walk back to the waiting area debating to self about the pitfalls of wishful thinking. Could really, really do with a cigarette.

<p>1149

<p>Wonder if Dr Watson treated any patients at all and how he didn't go out of business. Think about whether he could have been the Coroner for Marlboro County. Realise I am merging Sherlock Holmes stories, CSI and a cigarette advertisement into one. Think about pitching new TV show. Then realise it's rubbish.

<p>1151

<p>They call 158. I bound up to the counter. Embassy official asks questions. I answer them. I put my left index finger, then my right index finger on the scanner. It doesn't make any of the cool noises I associate with fingerprint scanners in the movies. We end up talking about the first Matrix movie. Faintly bizarre.

<p>1154

<p>Interview over, visa granted, told to pay money at the accounts desk. Then told to get out.

<p>1159

<p>Back on the street. Fourth cigarette. Think about booking flights. Think about breakfast. Quickly prioritise. Wait for bus back home.

<p>On being prepared for an important interview

<p>Thank you for attending. There are just a few ground rules I think we need to establish before you go for your interview. Standard things, really, nothing to worry about. Firstly, remember to wear a suit and tie. And shoes. And underwear. Socks are good too, as is a shirt. Basically, go fully dressed. The embassy are less likely to approve your request if you arrive in states of semi-dress, partial dress or, indeed, full undress. Especially as they will have nowhere to clip your security pass that you would want a security pass to be clipped to. Those safety pins can sting, you know.

<p>We've asked around your office, for background information about you, and we were wondering if you could be a little bit less ? well, you. We're not saying that you should lie in your interview, at least not factually, but you should perhaps be aware that when you answer questions, you should resist any urges you might have to overelaborate.

<p>A good start is to give your name properly when asked to do so at the beginning of the interview. We have a list of answers to this seemingly simple question which the embassy do not regard as legitimate responses:

<p>Who the man? Me the man.

<p>Whoever you want me to be, baby.

<p>Who am I? Who the hell are you?

<p>King Zog of Albania

<p>I am woman, hear me roar.

<p>Please resist the temptation to give these or any other of the prohibited answers. We'll give you the list when you leave. Now this next point applies to all of the questions you will be asked. Answer directly, simply and honestly, without attempting to bring your personality, such as it is, into the matter. For example, how would you answer the question, "Have you ever been involved in terrorism?"

<p>(muffled response)

<p>You see, that's precisely the sort of thing we need to cut out. Embassy officials do not have any sense of humour, at least not one officially recognised by the State Department or by Her Majesty's Foreign and Commonwealth Office. They will not appreciate a water-shooting flower in your lapel, they will look unkindly upon a concealed electric buzzer in your palm when you shake their hand and they especially dislike stink bombs. Or any other bombs. In fact, all other bombs.

<p>You may be under the impression that your sarcasm will be interpreted as wit, perhaps charm, perhaps even the self-deprecating and worldly-wise bon mots of a subtle, dry satirist. This impression is wrong. Whatever amusement you intend will be heard only as "I am annoying, please reject my application". At best, they will attribute your verbal incontinence as evidence of nervousness, at worst it will be decided that you are trying to hide something, be it state secrets, a murky and troubled past, or possibly explosives concealed around your person.

<p>A further note about your answers. Please remember that at no point during the interview should you question the patriotism of the embassy officials. They do not appreciate being called Communists. They dislike this quite intensely.

<p>(muffled enquiry)

<p>No, you are expressly forbidden from stating, as you put it, 'You, sir, are not a patriot'.

<p>(muffled response)

<p>Expressly forbidden.

<p>As to other matters, you should remember that your bag will be searched as you enter the building and you may be asked to show the contents of your bag at any time during your wait there. It would be advisable for you to clear out any, shall we say, materials of an unusual or sensitive nature before you attend. We have a prohibited list for you to take away and read; sorry for the cigarette burn in the corner, that was made by one of our less successful candidates.

<p>Body language in your interview is very important, as the consular officers will be watching you for any sign of misplaced stress, nerves, or even major psychological disorders. Flapping your arms around your face to rid yourself from the invisible flies in front of you will not create a good impression. Speaking in tongues is likewise ill-advised, as is any attempt to convert your interviewer to any new religion where you are the godhead.

<p>One last point to recall is that Marines will be stationed at the embassy and they have orders to shoot first, shoot second, consider some more shooting and then fax Washington, DC for permission to hire someone who will ask a question at a future time to be decided, all while shooting. They should be addressed as 'sir' at all times.

<p>Contrasts

<p>I just want to extend my sympathies to the families of those killed and those who have been injured in today's awful, awful events.

<p>While the radio, TV and internet detail the chaos, I look outside at Victoria and although the rail station is closed, there is little evidence to show that this little corner of London has been a victim. Yesterday and today have shown a contrast which is quite terrible.

<p>Ken Livingstone spoke eloquently today about those responsible:

<p>"They seek to divide London, they seek Londoners to turn against each other ? this city of London is the greatest in the world because everybody lives side by side in harmony. Londoners will not be divided by this cowardly attack."

<p>I hope that's true.

<p>Elevation

<p>The lift doors take a final breath before closing and Jason's fingers slip from their edges, cracking the nail on his index finger in the process. Almost mockingly, the lift remains on the floor for a few more seconds, allowing Jason to look, to stare unashamedly through the metal-framed glass door through at Poppy before the lift bears her down towards the ground. Her eyes are looking up as the lift descends and he wonders what's going through her mind. Jason starts to walk back along the corridor until a thought, a voice, an insistence stops him.

<p>Slowed down, Jason's thought process could bear scrutiny, as instincts of which he is scarcely aware stir and combine to move him into action. He runs across the walkway towards the main doors, fumbling for his security pass to get back into his office. Halfway across, he skids to a stop and leans over the balcony to look down for other lifts. All are on the ground floor, none moving, none rising to meet him and bring hope. He turns back and runs towards the main doors.

<p>Security pass in hand, he swipes it past the electronic slate which beeps a denial. Gritting his teeth to prevent himself from swearing overloudly, Jason swipes the card again. This time the small light flickers from amber to green and he can hear the small thunk of magnets releasing. He grabs hold of the door, swings it open and heads towards a corner staircase. The staircases in the building, four of them, all need to be accessed with a swipe card and Jason is rejected by the building's electronic caretakers once more. Again presses the card to the pad, again he is accepted the second time.

<p>The advertised opulence of the company reception is thrown into desperate relief by the spartan stairwell which Jason runs down, one hand on the speckled and cut handrail, the other hand flailing for balance as he navigates each predictable yet sudden corner. There are no signs to tell him which floor he has reached, or which half-floor, no way of assessing his progress as he bounds down the stairs, taking them two at a time, leaping the final three to the halfway landing and grabbing the wall partition for support, as a fulcrum, to twist himself round the next point, gaining momentum, striding longer, moving faster, urgent. Until he falls.

<p>Poppy leaves the lift at the ground floor and walks towards the reception desk, remembering that she has to hand in her visitor pass. A two-hour meeting passed without event as usual, as her two hour meetings on Wednesdays in this building usually do. She considers whether to have a coffee despite the fact that she isn't sure whether she wants one. She looks around, as though someone is watching her, as though there are questions about her presence, her eligibility to be in this place at this time. She goes over to the cafe and orders, remembering that the servers are slow. There is a lingering impulse in her mind to remain.

<p>Placed on the counter, the mere presence of coffee wakes her up. Poppy murmurs thanks to the girl behind the counter then moves over to a free table. To complete the pretence of belonging, she withdraws her notebook and begins to read the notes from the last meeting, countering the overriding compulsion to look back at the lifts. She flips the pages of her notebook back to the beginning, justifying this as an overview of the entire project, realising that it is an excuse to stay for longer, wondering whether she has invented something in her own mind that doesn't exist, outwardly calm and efficient.

<p>A few minutes pass and she realises that she has been moving the pages, turn by turn, without reading any of them. Her gaze has been steady, at a midpoint between her notes and the edge of the table; waiting, hoping, anticipating. A glance at her watch confirms what Poppy already knows, that this is time borrowed and that she has to leave. She doesn't bother to drink any more from the coffee she has only sipped as she picks up the notebook and packs it into her briefcase, making slow motions. She hands in her security pass at reception and walks beyond the security gates. Leaving the building, turning to walk to the station, she allows herself a brief backwards glance.

<p>While he hopes that the bruise will reduce and fade in time, Jason knows that he has no time to think about this. First impressions are past regrets and there is no place for them as he hopes that he has replaced everything from his pockets and bounds down the final steps to the ground floor. He barges into the doors with his shoulder, forgetting the necessity for his security pass, and is rewarded by falling back on the floor. For the first time today, his pass is accepted without query and he throws open the door into the broad, open space of the building's ground floor. He looks towards the entry/exit gates. He looks towards the lifts. He runs over to the reception area and looks out onto the street.

<p>Jason runs out onto the street, already defeated when he leaves the final doors. He stops, pauses, gives up. Head hanging, he starts to turn when a hand restrains him. Looking up, he sees Poppy, concerned and vulnerable: porcelain. Looking up at her, he doesn't know what to say; looking at her as he stands up properly and ready, he doesn't know what he was doing other than the fact that it was right. Poppy stands there, wondering why she had the instinct to return, wondering how she had the nerve to reach over and touch him. She doesn't know what he's going to say and she's terrified, mortified, waiting for the inevitable rejection, the horror that could ensue after building up something so much in her head.

<p>He looks around, as if further inspiration is needed, and stays silent. Her hand still rests on his forearm. He doesn't know what to say and neither does she. He takes the initiative and holds her hand. He clasps it for a moment before telling her that he'll see her at the next meeting, or words to that purpose. He relinquishes her hand and goes back through the glass doors into the building. Staring, unbelieving, Poppy remains. For a moment, for a heartbeat, she remains where she is, considering the past few minutes, considering the spectrum of emotions she has coloured, considering everything she might have felt or possibly still does.

<p>As he reaches the security gates, the receptionist beckons him over. informing him that he needs to wait for a moment. He asks if there is a problem with his pass. She says no. He asks whether there is a problem with the gates, perhaps they are defective and aren't allowing people access to the building. She says no. He is about to ask another question when the girl behind the desk points behind him, through the glass, through those transparent doors and into the street. Poppy stands there, perhaps on the verge of tears, perhaps considering coming back into the building.

<p>The girl at reception leans in towards Jason and details his attempts to get from the fourth floor to the ground. She provides the narrative of Poppy's timewasting on the ground floor. She advises him that she won't readmit him to the building until she sees that the girl outside is ready to leave, one way or another. Jason starts to walk out when he sees Poppy walking in back in. They meet between glass doors. Standing apart, they stare and hear the magnetic locks between the doors slowly close. Poppy admits that she waited for him. Jason admits that he ran down the stairwells to reach her. Poppy admits, Jason admits.

<p>They talk for a few minutes or so before the receptionist unlocks the doors.
