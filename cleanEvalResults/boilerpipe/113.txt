<h>YOU CAN COUNT ON ME

<p>MY DARLING CLEMENTINE

<p>HUDSON HAWK

<p>BULL DURHAM

<p>If a year goes by that I haven't watched one of those titles, it gets popped in the ol' DVD spinner.  Obviously, most of those are films that impacted me one way or another in childhood, so you'll kindly cut me a shitload of slack for the notable absence of Renoir, Welles, Ozu, Pyun, Lubitsch, etc. (though when TO BE OR NOT TO BE finally hits DVD in March, it will surely be added to the above list).

<p>Ever Yearned to Watch Uncle Junior Fuck Neve Campbell?

<p>Then James Toback is your rainmaker, and WHEN WILL I BE LOVED your perverse, perfect storm.  For everyone else, it's just further evidence of a one-time worthwhile filmmaker's creative decline that began with BLACK AND WHITE in 1999. 

<p>Toback's an odd bird:  a spoiled rich kid who insinuated himself into the black counterculture back in the late 1960's while gambling himself into serious debt *and* running up a tab of sexual conquests that would make Wilt Chamberlin break out his calculator.  He also allegedly took the biggest hit of LSD in recorded history (the annals of drug history being so scrupulously reliable).  In other words, the motherfucker lived his ass off, and, for over twenty years, these lurid exploits were often the fuel for great screenplays (e.g. THE GAMBLER, FINGERS and BUGSY) that captured life dangling over the precipice.  I adore FINGERS; it's impure male id spurted out at 24fps about a schizophrenic concert pianist/thug (Harvey Keitel) who bears a bruising resemblance to the filmmaker himself.  It's got a Cassavetes-esque wildness about it, though it's absent the indie pioneer's humanism.  There isn't a kind bone in FINGERS' body; it's a masterpiece of misanthropy that enrages as much as it dazzles.  If you've never seen it, do so.  (Working up a head of steam writing about it, I'm wishing I had a copy at the ready myself.)

<p>Even when Toback is overbearing, which is always, he gets such nakedly honest performances out of his lead actors that the films, ostensibly personal statements for the writer/director, become dual confessionals.  Most people either love or hate TWO GIRLS AND A GUY; despite Natasha Gregson Wagner's most useless performance in a career littered with them, I think it's a phenomenal high wire act by Robert Downey, Jr., who rescues Toback's worst writing impulses with one of the great virtuoso film performances of the last twenty years.  Watching him as he flits about his Manhattan loft bellowing the first movement of Vivaldi's GLORIA or banging out a flamboyant rendition of "You Don't Know Me' at the piano while ineptly playing traffic cop in the two-car pileup that is his love life is to see a limitlessly talented actor redline it for ninety minutes.  It's the performance people had been waiting to see Downey, Jr. give for years, and selfishly hoping he'd get around to before killing himself.  (Thankfully, he's still with us, though it's been since WONDER BOYS that he brought his "A" game.)

<p>If Toback's ear was getting a bit tinny with that film, he went stone cold tone deaf with BLACK AND WHITE, which felt like Toback trying to reassert his hipster cred within the African-American community by casting every hip-hop or sports star available.  Most of the Wu-Tang Clan shows up, as does Mike Tyson, but Toback the filmmaker does not, and the film collapses into a heap of disconnected scenes that are only occasionally amusing (e.g. Robert Downey, Jr. risking his life in the name of improv by propositioning Tyson).  It's the kind of disaster that would've made for a great behind-the-scenes documentary.  Unfortunately, one has not emerged.

<p>Toback followed BLACK AND WHITE up with HARVARD MAN, which was so slipshod in its execution I didn't think him capable of a more dubious achievement.  And that brings us back to WHEN WILL I BE LOVED.  Once again, Toback trots out his famous friends -- Damon Dash, Mike Tyson and Lori Singer -- to show us that he's -- yes, Lori Singer -- still a man about town.  Meanwhile, he's investigating the balance of power in male/female relationships, and how it's predicated by material wealth.  Or something.  To tell you the truth, I lost interest early on when Frederick Weller got into an exposition-crammed screaming match with some bimbo on Times Square.  Though there was always an element of the undisciplined about Toback, he was never this clumsy in setting up his narrative.

<p>But I kept it on mostly for the prurient pleasure of watching Neve Campbell in the buff, not to see her get shtupped by Dominic Chianese (the only kind of fucking I want to see Uncle Junior doing is the figurative sort).  As for Toback, you may still be living the wild life at sixty, but your dispatches from the edge have gone from exhilarating to pathetic.  It's an act that's no longer becoming.  Time to keep it to yourself, man.

<p>Jim Garrison Once Did Fifty Minutes on THE TONIGHT SHOW

<p>And James Wolcott is correct:  in today's contentious, soundbite climate, this would be unthinkable.  Read his link to Rigorous Institution , as well.

<p>BTW, I think Garrison was, by and large, a crackpot, but his quixotic quest for justice helped chip away disturbing half-truths in the Warren Commission, which, to my mind, was equal parts investigation and cover-up.

<p>Oscar Commentary

<p>I knew that the cluttered Best Actor category would be the stuff of anguished disappointment today, but I was secretly convinced it would be Cheadle getting the shaft, rather than Giamatti or Neeson.  Obviously, only one of these guys was going to crack the final five, what with the other four -- Eastwood, DiCaprio, Foxx and a horrifically undeserving Depp -- being mortal locks.  So, while I'm happy to see the great Don Cheadle score his first Oscar nomination, it's an absolute injustice that the equally great Paul Giamatti will be receiving his first nomination (and a probable win) for what will likely be a fine performance in Ron Howard's spoonful of saccharine, CINDERELLA MAN. 

<p>And it appears that the Academy fell for HOTEL RWANDA's guilt trip, while turning an indifferent shoulder to Bill Condon's KINSEY.  Being that he's a past winner, I thought Bill was a shoo-in for Best Original Screenplay.  While the competition was stiff, he really should be currently occupying the slot given to John Logan or Terry George and Keir Pearson.  So, boo.  (But "yay" for Brad Bird's nomination!)

<p>Scanning the list for undeserving nominations... everyone knew that FINDING NEVERLAND would CHOCOLAT its way into some prominent categories, so no surprise there.  I've seen TUPAC: RESURRECTION, and, hey, if the Documentary committee wants to reward the executive producer of CRIBS and I WANT A FAMOUS FACE for celebrating the poorly-lived life of a misogynistic, overrated rapper, while again ignoring the consistently brilliant work of Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky (your BLAIR WITCH 2 cracks will be not appreciated in the comments), then bully for them.  D.A. Pennebaker and Albert Maysles have only been nominated once, while Frederick Wiseman, arguably our greatest living documentarian, has never been nominated. 

<p>SHARK TALE?  I wasn't crazy about INNOCENCE, but that should've snagged one of the slots occupied by the dual PDI assault on quality animation. 

<p>The Best Song category is a disaster area.  Jon Brion's "Knock Yourself Out" distinguishes itself by its absence.  And another year, another Carter Burwell snub.

<p>Edited to add that it's a fucking laugh to see THE SEA INSIDE nominated for Best Makeup over HELLBOY.

<p>Like Christmas Day... with a Whip

<p>I'll be seeing Sam Fuller's FORTY GUNS for the first time today.  At the Aero Theater.  In 70mm.  I've had multiple opportunities in the past to see it on crappy video bootlegs, but avoided them, preferring to see this demented, purported classic in its proper presentation.  That'll finally happen at 5 PM today.  I will report back here (at some point).

<p>PRECINCT 13 Revisited

<p>Director Jean-Francois Richet does the viewer an enormous favor midway through his remake of ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 not by referencing John Carpenter's original, or Hawke's RIO BRAVO, on which Carpenter's film was based, but Renny Harlin's DIE HARD 2:  as Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), the film's protagonist, grapples with a masked bad guy, he winds up pinned to the ground next to a prison transport, its undercarriage lined with conveniently sturdy and pointy icicles.  What happens next should come as no surprise even if you haven't seen DIE HARD 2.

<p>And this is a favor how? 

<p>Well, if you're as unabashed a fan of Harlin's idiotic, logic-flouting sequel as I am, you can read the homage as Richet signaling his crass, audience pleasing intent.  In fact, you'd really better read it as such; otherwise, you're in for a long, tedious journey through an exhaustive compendium of 1980's action film cliches that might be serving some greater thematic purpose if you make the mistake of looking too closely .  Granted, the gritty seriousness of the opening prologue, in which Roenick inadvertently sacrifices his undercover colleagues during a drug buy gone bad, and its Detroit setting get things off to a rollicking, NARC-ish start, but the minute the grinding mechanics of the plot kick in, and we realize that the information imparted in that prologue could've been handled with one simple perception shift in the police station set-up, we know immediately that we're watching trash.  The question is whether it's moronic or self-aware trash.

<p>This is where someone might be tempted to take me to task for suggesting that Renny Harlin has a self-aware bone in his burly Finnish body, to which I say "Samuel L. Jackson in DEEP BLUE SEA."   Obviously, there's something subversive going on in the guy's shamelessly lousy pictures, and that "something" is what Richet has deigned to ape to modestly diverting returns.  Call it the ROAD HOUSE principle:  if the filmmaker doesn't insult our intelligence by putting on airs, we'll gladly roll in the muck with him. 

<p>And, aside from that unnecessary prologue, that's mostly what Richet does, obviating the narrative inefficiency of James DeMonaco's bloated script by amping up the violence and getting decent performances out of his very good ensemble (save for an annoying-from-his-first-overly-mannered-twitch John Leguizamo).  Which is not to say that this go-for-broke sensibility results in any memorable set pieces; again, like Harlin, Richet may be able to pull of a single, well-composed shot (e.g. Gabriel Byrne's confrontation with Maria Bello), but his action choreography is pretty lackluster.  Still, despite the disposability of the major sequences, they get the job done in decent workmanlike fashion. 

<p>I certainly understand Harry's enthusiasm for the film, and concede that he might be on to something with viewing ASSAULT as a hardcore throwback to 80's genre garbage (though I see a lot more Glickenhaus than Pyun on display here).  But this film is competent in a way those films so hilariously were not.  Richet's work is strictly Harlin-ville -- not a bad place to hang out so long as you're familiar with and accepting of the terrain.

<p>Camille Orders Cos Neutered

<p>These allegations are suspect, to be sure, but the famously domineering wife of the great comic can't be taking any chances at this late stage in the game.  The result may be a less aggressive, stay-at-home Cos, but the woman has a fortune to protect.  Actually, this would not be the first time such drastic measures were taken in the world of comedy; fifteen years ago, Charlie Callas revealed in his autobiography FLOP SWEAT that he mutilated his own genitals after developing a delirium inducing crush on the blonde lead dancer in Sting's "We'll Be Together" video.  The impact on Callas's act would prove disastrous when he inelegantly wedged the gruesome experience into his old nightclub routine to the utter horror of an unsuspecting audience at The Flamingo in Vegas.

<p>And while we're on the subject, someone please nominate David Koechner for comedic immortality (or at least treat him to a fine Beef Bowl dinner on me).  The payoff to his "I shit a squirrel" bit in WAKE UP, RON BURGANDY is the stuff of rare, demented genius.

<p>Fry Guide

<p>Yes.   That there are people on the talk back expressing disappointment over the likes of John Cleese not getting the nod... <insert .gif of Dar Robinson plummeting 220 feet from the L.A. Hyatt Regency>.

<p>Update:  It took until 1:52 PM EST for some obsessed geek to bemoan Tom Baker's failure to land the role. 

<p>For the uninitiated, Tom Baker is a mediocre British character actor who had the good fortune to land the titular role in DR. WHO during the 1970's. 

<p>Again for the uninitiated, DR. WHO was a mediocre British sci-fi series -- created by the same guy who did the much-better-because-Diana-Rigg-was-positively-delectable THE AVENGERS -- in which the titular character traveled through time in a contraption called the Tardis.  The big laugh being that the Tardis was a telephone booth.  Do yourself a favor and never watch it just to see what the fuss is about; you'll likely be driven mad.  Or, worse, you'll become a fan yourself, which is the same thing as being driven mad, so just forget it altogether.

<p>Twenty Years and Twenty Days

<p>LBJ becomes the youngest ever to record an NBA triple-double.   The only surprise is that it didn't come sooner (he's been awfully close).  Most importantly, the Cavs stay at .500 in this Western Conference road swing, though the forth quarter defensive collapse is disappointing after their great second half zone performance against the Jazz last week.  I'm not too optimistic about their chances tonight against the Kings, but I'll be watchin' nonetheless.

<p>Bush to Troops:  "Get Ready to Die"

<p>" And don't go cryin' to your countrymen, 'cuz they're totally cool with it. "  Should be a fun inauguration.  Good thing I've got lots of writing, a boxful of Marx Brothers films, and plenty of reading with which to completely shut it out.

<p>On Accountability Moments

<p>It appears I missed the initial furor over our boy prince's insistence that the 2004 Election was an "accountability moment", which means that, yes, he believes his victory was essentially absolution of  his administration's many, many sins .  It's not that I don't agree with the President; on the contrary, I've been using such rhetoric as a means to browbeat my friends who voted for the jackass into a guilt-ridden stupor (often because "Kerry just didn't seem like much of a better option" to which I still reply "Well, with a clean slate he's a better option than the other guy right now, and, fuck, if he's no good, you get to vote him out in four years!  How's that for a happy confluence of personal responsibility and democracy?")  This is their President, their country, and their mess to anguish/cheer over.  But it's one thing for me to espouse this belief, and quite another for the commander-in-chief to smugly parrot it while his misdeeds over the last four years result in an accumulation of fresh sins for which he will not personally face another "accountability moment". 

<p>I know it's futile to get worked up over the Bush Administration's mendacity, unprecedented for its across-the-board application, when there are sharpshooters like Paul Krugman posted on the parapets, but some mornings I wake up with bad gas.

<p>First Trip to the Gym in a Month...

<p>... and I'm punished not by aching limbs or a horrific scale reading, but, rather, by somehow, in the delirium of a vigorous workout on the elliptical, calling up Climax Blues Band's middle-of-the-road 80's anthem "I Love You" on my random subconscious playlist.  What it's doing hanging out in my deeper recesses in the first place, I have no idea.

<p>Ahem.  The Climax Blues Band being one of three memorably mediocre, tripartite-titled 70's/80's soft rock outfits that defined bad taste during that era (listed below with their biggest hit):

<p>Climax Blues Band - "I Love You"

<p>Pure Prairie League - "Amie"

<p>Little River Band - "Lonesome Loser"

<p>I really have nothing to write about today.  I just got back from seeing IN GOOD COMPANY, and it's neither good nor bad enough to warrant much discussion.  The clunky set-up nearly drove me from the theater, but I hung around, and I'm glad I did, if only for the scattered moments that do work.  Scarlet Johansson's dorm room seduction of Topher Grace is perfectly observed right down to the lighting of the incense (ah, college).  And there's a scene near the end (actually, it should've been the end) between Dennis Quaid and Grace that's so well played, I found myself wishing the rest of the film had been deft enough in its construction to earn the tears it nearly elicits.  It's a lovely little moment that takes the narrative in a direction I wasn't expecting; unfortunately, it's the only unpredictable move in the entire picture.  Done right, this film could've really struck a profound, generational chord.  Instead, it's just formula pap.

<p>A Love Song for Tony Young

<p>Basketball fans (particularly my Gafflin homies) would do well to check out this site if they haven't already:  http://www.82games.com/ .  To my mind, the plus-minus rating is the most accurate reflection of a player's value to his team -- and, to an extent, his fantasy value -- going today.  And again to my Gafflin crew:  what two players are number one and number two this season?  And where's that overrated Luol Deng I used as bait to allegedly pilfer Slammer's roster?  (And, all gloating aside, where's my much-beloved Luke Ridnour hanging out?  Ouch!)

<p>Big ups to the finest lawyer in the land, T. Young, for getting me hooked on this site.

<p>DVD J-Day

<p>Today, I do Becker directing Gabin , Wyler directing Dreiser , and Pyun directing Hauer (and Whirry) .  One of these includes a Lee Horsley reference.  Do you know which one it is?

<p>Also, Happy MLK Day to y'all!  This means it's time for my annual viewing of TRADING PLACES, a dating-back-to-college tradition that is either slyly subversive or racially insensitive; I'll let you decide for yourself.  And let me know what you think is the worse MLK Day transgression:  me watching TRADING PLACES, or TCM airing Anthony Mann's THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

<p>Finally, on a serious note (although I'm really not joking about the whole TRADING PLACES thing), PBS will be airing part one of Ken Burns and Geoffrey C. Ward's UNFORGIVABLE BLACKNESS: THE RISE AND FALL OF JACK JOHNSON.  Watch it.

<p>Albert Pyun Apprenticed Under Akira Kurosawa?

<p>Tommy Gunn to Akira-san's Rocky Balboa?  Or is there some aesthetic connection between YOJIMBO and CYBORG that I completely missed (you'll forgive me for not explicitly looking for it before now)?

<p>Anthony Lane Writes *Real* Good

<p>From his review of THE LIFE AQUATIC:

<p>"It is heartening to reflect that the best of Bill Murray may be yet to come. These days he is a wiser and a madder man; his ennui has lost any trace of a pose, and he sits around (for a tall guy, he can look oddly squat, verging on the shrunken) as if wearing an invisible T-shirt that says 'I Told You So.'"

<p>He's a bit of an outsider in the critical community (for being a "lit" guy, I guess), and he's not always the most knowledgeable on film history, but, damn it, the man throws down a supremely fluid prose. 

<p>There's also a brief review of LEMONY SNICKET in there, which got me to thinkin' on why we haven't seen any major lamentations on the film's highly disappointing domestic b.o. performance.  (A Jim Carrey family film based on a best selling series of children's novels not getting to $150 million?  Yikes.)  Maybe the regime change at Paramount rendered the topic unappetizing or superfluous.

<p>Bring Your Towel

<p>Even though we're getting a grown-up, unaffected Batman movie this summer, there's really only one film that matters to me.   The lack of Ford Prefect is curious, but, I suppose, understandable given Marvin's scene stealing potential. 

<p>There are those claiming that this will be a big-budget cult film, that it's THE FIFTH ELEMENT without Bruce Willis's drawing power.  While the comparisons to Besson's pretty, but empty-headed intergalactic epic will justifiably rankle Addams fans the world over, there may be something to this.  Is it possible for a cerebral sci-fi parody to find profitable purchase in a country where lazy laffers like BRUCE ALMIGHTY and MEET THE FOCKERS run riot at the box office?  Does "sardonic" sell when delivered without a serrated political edge (i.e. by someone other than Jon Stewart, Michael Moore or your typical FOX NEWS anchor)?

<p>On an unrelated, personal health note, I bravely made it to the forty-something minute point of CATWOMAN before tapping out.  The thought of a filmmaker aping the awful schoolyard courtship from DAREDEVIL and somehow failing to equal its inspration's basement level of incomptence made me woozy with despair.  Look, I knew the movie was going to be shit; I just thought... that... y'know... there, uh... might've been... stuff... <insert .gif of Dar Robinson plummeting 220 feet from the L.A.

<p>Rock Bottom:  Passed

<p>I just paused CATWOMAN to watch TRL.  This FF teaser better be grislier than Bud Dwyer's last will and testament.

<p>Hm.  So, Kelly Clarkson's "Since U Been Gone" isn't a cover of the classic, Graham Bonnet-era Rainbow rocker.

<p>And... they show less than fifteen seconds of footage -- way too brief to accurately gauge The Thing's chintziness (though the ever-lovin' blue-eyed one appears to be having skin color issues).  And I won't be seeing ELEKTRA tomorrow to feast my eyes upon its accursed muddled-ness.

<p>Beachwood Outrage

<p>Otherpeoplesblogs chronicles revenge north of Franklin Avenue.  Fascinating.  But you should've camped out until the owner of the car appeared.  Or called me to do it.  I would've passed up an afternoon of DVD watchin' to snap the money shot.

<p>FYI, drive farther north on Beachwood, and you just might run into The Cowboy (of MULHOLLAND DRIVE, not INNERSPACE).

<p>FANTASTIC Fore!

<p>The Naked Critic aka Jeffrey Wells (it's not really, but, y'know, everyone needs the image of a nude Jeffrey Wells singed into their consciousness every now and then) has teed off on the most dreaded comic book adaptation of the year with a detailed but disingenuous sounding review of the new FANTASTIC FOUR trailer , which, by the way, just premiered on the East Coast broadcast of TRL.  (It's not that I doubt the wretchedness of the teaser; it's just that it reads like a rival studio publicist trying to sound like a malcontented twentysomething geek who just lost a screenwriting gig to Alvin Sargent.)  Having just finished laughing at a picture of The Thing I ran across this afternoon in the new EW (there's a pigeon perched on his shoulder, pooping... go ahead and think I'm making that up), I can't tell you how excited I am to see this travesty for myself.

<p>But we here at "For No Good Reason" pride ourselves on giving voice to the folks on the other side of the ideological aisle, so, for the inarticulate, I'll-eat-Mickey-Rourke's-stool-if-you-stamp-"Marvel"-on-it perspective, you can hop over to the SuperHeroHype message boards (which, honestly, I only visited to see if someone was hosting the trailer), where the reaction is like the sightless child blinking off the darkness to gaze upon the glorious visage of Jesus Christ.  There are screencaps there, too.  Enjoy.

<p>VARIETY Venom

<p>From Nicole Laport's story trumpeting Alvin Sargent's deal to write SPIDER-MAN 3 and 4:

<p>The deal caps a spectacular second wind for Sargent, a two-time Oscar winner who will turn 74 in April and has shown that well-honed character development skills can make a veteran writer more valuable than the twentysomething comicbook geeks who usually get these jobs.

<p>Why doesn't she just come out and say "than Dan Harris and Mike Dougherty who usually get these jobs"?  They're the only "twentysomething comicbook geeks" writing for any of the major superhero franchises.

<p>Odd spasm of pique aside, fans of SPIDER-MAN 2 (i.e. sane individuals) should be pleased with this development, as should producer Laura Ziskin, who just scored two more gigs for her septuagenarian writer hubby.

<p>
