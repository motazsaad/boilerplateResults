<p>Masters and Workers:

<p>Labour relations in ancient Egypt

<p>    The demotic maxims in Ankhsheshonq's Instruction sum up the attitude of the upper classes toward the working people:

<p>Give one loaf to your laborer, receive two from (the work of) his arms.

<p>Give one loaf to the one who labors, give two to the one who gives orders.

<p>The Instruction of Ankhsheshonq

<p>M. Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature, Vol. 3, p.176

<p>Not much has changed during the last few millennia.

<p>The master: a self-image of benevolence

<p>    Treat your dependents well, in so far as it belongs to you to do so; and it belongs to those whom Ptah has favored. If any one fails in treating his dependents well it is said: "He is a person . . ." As we do not know the events which may happen tomorrow, he is a wise person by whom one is well treated. When there comes the necessity of showing zeal, it will then be the dependents themselves who say: "Come on, come on," if good treatment has not quitted the place; if it has quitted it, the dependents are defaulters.

<p>The Precepts of Ptah-Hotep , ca. 2200 BCE

<p>    The High Priest of Amen Rome-roi saw himself in the role of the benefactor of his servants, after he had renovated the bakery and was not sparing with self praise

<p>    Oh priests, scribes of the House of Amen, servants of the holy sacrifices foremost, bakers, brewers, pastry cooks, all of you entering through the gates of this workshop in the House of Amen, remember me fondly, praise my name for my good deeds, for wise I was.

<p>    I found this room and it was about to crumble, the woodwork was decaying, the lintels made of wood had fallen down and disappeared similar to the painting covering the reliefs. I restored it all, wider than it had been, tall and big. I put in lintels made of sandstone, I made openings of real cedar wood. I turned it into a spacious workshop for the bakers and brewers entering it. I made it better than it had been, in order to protect the servants of my god, Amen-Re.

<p>    Beken-khonsu, another priest, had a similarly high opinion of his own achievements

<p>    I was a beloved father to my subordinates.  I taught the young wisdom and knowledge. I stretched my hand out to the miserable. I gave the needy sustenance. I did useful deeds in his temple as the chief official of works at Luxor on behalf of ... Ramses II.

<p>Inscription of Bekenkhonsu

<p>    Ahmose, a New Kingdom scribe took a personal interest in the fate of at least one of his servants. He wrote to his superior Ti

<p>    What Ahmose belonging to Peniati says to his master, the treasurer Ti: Why was my servant girl, which was with me, taken away and given to another? Am I not your servant obeying your instructions night and day? Let her payment, as far as I am concerned, be taken, as she is still young and does not know yet what work is. May my master order, that her work be done just as that of any servant girl of my master.

<p>For her mother has sent me the following message: 'You have let my child be taken away, while she was with you. But I did not object to my master, as she was with you as a child.' Thus she spoke to me, protesting.

<p>My translation from the German

<p>    Children were thus given into service at an early age, before they could be expected to do work. It is unclear from this letter whether the parents had to pay for her upkeep during this period or whether she was paid even at this age.

<p>The voice of the workers

<p>    Often abused, the ancient Egyptian worker still tried to improve his lot. A Middle Kingdom story includes the following passage:

<p>There was a boss (TAz.w - commander) who [commanded (?)] the workers. These workers said to him: "It is nice to make bread for you (and) pleasing to make [/// ///] for you. But what will you do for us?"

<p>A fragment from the Tale of Neferpesedjet, pUC 32156A Recto

<p>Co-workers

<p>    Having to deal with lazy workers did not just anger the people they were supposed to be working for, but also those who had to work with them. After doing his father Ma'a-nakhte-ef a favour, his son Pa-baky who, as a scribe responsible for the efficiency of his staff, was clearly unhappy with the labourer he had been sent:

<p>The scribe Pa-baky speaks to his father the draughtsman Ma'a-nakhte-ef.

<p>To the effect that: I heeded what you said to me, 'Let Ib work together with you!' Now look, he spends the day bringing the jar of water. There is no (other) chore for him every single day. He does not listen to your counsel which says to him, 'what have you done today?'

<p>Look, the sun has set and he is far away (with) the jar of water.

<p>Protest

<p>    Ancient Egypt was a stable, conservative society with a well developed class system and people were treated according to their standing, with blatant inequalities deeply ingrained in tradition. But tradition also set limits to the amount of work one could reasonably expect from one's workers and if the work quotas were seen as exaggerated (for whatever reason), it caused resentment and resistance. Thus the Hebrews voiced their protest  [1] :

<p>10     And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.

<p>11     Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: Yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.

<p>...

<p>16     There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make bricks: and behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people.

<p>Genesis, 5  [1]

<p>    We know only of a few instances of workers complaining before the first millennium BCE. Under the Ptolemies, on the other hand, workers' protests were quite frequently put in writing: In 255 BCE for instance, a gang of Greek quarry men felt that they were unjustly exploited by their foreman. They complained to the architect:

<p>To Kleôn the architect, greeting.

<p>We who belong to the original quarry-men from the place of embarcation are being wronged by Apollônios the ganger. He having set us to work at the hard rock and having selected us as against the rest, has shown (us only) the soft rock that he has (in the quarry), and now we are ruined, spoiling (our) iron (to no purpose); therefore we pray you that we may obtain justice; having cut the hard rock .... that we be not injured.

<p>Farewell.

<p>Strikes

<p>    The treatment corvée workers received from their employer, the pharaoh i.e. the state and its officials, was to a large extent dependent on the economic and political stability of the country. In his Great Edict Horemheb tried to curb some of the excesses of the system. But ordinary workers in full-time state employ were also put upon. When corruption and inefficiency towards the end of the reign of Ramses III had made the country barely governable and the workers in the  necropolis of Medinet Habu had not received their food rations, they organized the first recorded strike in history (year 29 of Ramses' reign).

<p>    Food was generally doled out once a month and was often barely adequate. When they ran short the workers declared

<p>We are starving to death. Another eighteen days remain until the beginning of the new month.

<p>    Then they assembled  all in one place, near a stela

<p>We will not return. Tell this to your taskmasters who are assembled there, at that place.

<p>    The hungry crowd approached the storehouses, but did  not force the doors. One of them spoke up

<p>We are starving hungry. Our tongue wasted away in thirst. No cloth is left. We are lacking oil. We have no fish, not even vegetables. Send to Pharaoh our master, send to the king our ruler, so that he may give us sustenance.

<p>    He repeated their complaint in front of the officials, but his comrades feared for him and agreed that in the end all would be well. Others refused to disperse unless they received their rations immediately. The officials considered this and called a clerk to

<p>Check the corn you have received and give from it to the men of the necropolis.

<p> 

<p>And Pe-montu-nabiat was brought and we received a ration of grain every day.

<p>The treatment of the workers

<p>    Subordinates were at times less than zealous in the performance of their duties. Threats, outspoken or veiled were used to keep them on their toes

<p>The mayor of the southern capital Sennefer speaks to the tenant-farmer Baki son of Kyson to the following effect. This letter is brought to you to tell you that I am coming to see you when we moor at Hu in three days' time. Do not let me find fault with you in your duties. Do not fail to have things in perfect order. ..... You are not to slack, because I know that you are lazy, and fond of eating in bed.

<p>Sennefer, mayor of Thebes, to his tenant, Baki [ 4 ]

<p>Reign of Amenhotep II (1450-1412 BCE)

<p>    A wise underling accepted his place in the order of things. Any, a scribe in the palace of queen Nefertari, knew how hierarchies work:

<p>Do not talk back to an angry superior,

<p>Let him have his way;

<p>Speak sweetly when he speaks sourly,

<p>It's the remedy that calms the heart.

<p>Fighting answers carry sticks,
