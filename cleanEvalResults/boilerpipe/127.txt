<p>An open letter to KPLU

<p>To whom it may concern,

<p>Your radio feature by Kirsten Kendrick on social security aired on February 11th appears to lack basis in fact. In the feature Ms. Kendrick interviews a local financial consultant on the subject of what people will need to know when they get a chance to manage their money  under President Bush's plan to divert money from social security into private accounts.

<p>Where is the evidence people will get to manage their own money under the Bush plan? Is Ms. Kendrick's report based solely on the President Bush's remarks in the State of the Union address? President Bush has not released a detailed plan and as of Tuesday, February 8th the White House said they had no plans to: see this story for details

<p>http://www.reuters.com/printerFriendlyPopup.jhtml?type=politicsNews&storyID=7574181

<p>Given this lack of a plan all reporting about so-called personal accounts is based on supposition. Without acknowledging this fact Ms. Kendrick's story both assumes  and helps spread the misinformation that people will have a chance to make their own decisions over what to do with the money from their "personal accounts". There is no evidence that the so-called "personal accounts" will have any resemblance to what is generally considered personal ownership. Ms. Kendrick's feature blithely ignores this fact.

<p>MSNBC's Martin Wolk on February 4th reported

<p>(http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6914807/) wrote that:

<p>"President Bush frequently argues that one of the big advantages of his proposed personal retirement accounts is that unlike traditional Social Security they would allow participants to leave any accumulated wealth to their ‚Äúchildren or grandchildren.‚Äù

<p>"But that is not completely true under the proposal that has been advanced by White House officials, which would require many workers to convert some or all of their savings into annuities that would expire at death."

<p>and that: "According to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on the still-sketchy proposal this week, many workers who elect to participate in the personal account program would be required at retirement age to purchase an annuity to ensure they have a minimal stream of annual income for the rest of their life."

<p>Mr Wolk minces word by saying that the assumptions promoted the President and repeated by Ms. Kendricks are "not completely true." They are intentionally misleading. To be blunt they are lies promoted by the White House to help sell their plan. There are many ways to approach this story and many ways to distort it. I encourage KPLU and Ms. Kendricks to investigate these issue more thorougly before reporting. Some resources for these investigations could include: www.thereisnocrisis.com, www.talkingpointsmemo.com, the Campaign for America's Future at http://www.ourfuture.org/issues_and_campaigns/socialsecurity/index.cfm

<p>Both our state's Senators and many Representatives oppose Bush's plan inasmuch as it is known. They would also make a good resource.

<p>Thanks very much,

<p>war is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength, Bush wants to save social security

<p>Please repeat after me: war is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength, Bush wants to save social security.

<p>‚ÄúBush: Save Social Security‚Äù was the post State of  the Union headline in the Feb 4th Bellingham Herald. This headline no doubt produced a state of confusion in many who read it. In what sense does President Bush want to ‚Ä?save social security‚Äô? Perhaps only in the sense of that officer in Vietnam who said: ‚ÄúWe had to destroy the village in order save it.‚Äù

<p>So why is the major media working so hard for Mr. Bush? It‚Äôs a good question, and maybe the question. Democrats have been doing a good job of holding their elected officials accountable, but it‚Äôs time to start working on the press. The battle to save social security has in many ways already been won in Washington, D.C. but if we do nothing it may be lost in newsrooms around the country. Here‚Äôs another key question: When the President tells a lie is it the duty of the press to repeat the lie verbatim? Or is it the duty of the press to call the President out for lying? When we fail to answer this question correctly we go to war on false pretenses, gut key social programs, and bankrupt the nation.

<p>In 1946 George Orwell published his famous essay ‚ÄúPolitics and the English Language‚Äù in which he wrote: ‚ÄúA man may take to drink because he feels himself to be a failure, and then fail all the more completely because he drinks. It is rather the same thing that is happening to the English language. It becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.‚Äù The times being what they are we cannot afford foolish thoughts or a slovenly media which fails to hold the powerful accountable to the truth.

<p>Diverting money from the social security trust fund into private accounts will not save and strengthen social security, it will only weaken and defund it. According to the Center for Economic and Policy Research nearly 2/3rds of elderly households get more than half their income from social security and nearly half of the elderly would fall below the poverty line without it. Additionally, more than 6 million workers receive disability benefits through the Social Security trust fund, as do 1.6 million children. These people have been effectively disappeared from the national debate. As Senator Patty Murray states: ‚ÄúWhile some are trying to enrich Wall Street or push an ideology or force market experiments on senior citizens, our priority in this discussion should be ensuring that we're doing right by those who rely on Social Security ‚Äì from current workers to retirees, the disabled and widows.‚Äù To help save Social Security please visit www.thereisnocrisis.com

<p>Senator Murray Vows to Fight to Preserve Social Security

<p>Senator Murray Vows to Fight to Preserve Social Security

<p>For Immediate Release: Thursday, February 3, 2005

<p>http://murray.senate.gov/news.cfm?id=231476

<p>From the desk Senator Patty Murray:

<p>A few short years after the 1932 stock market crash and the onset of the Great Depression, one of our nation's greatest leaders ‚Äì Franklin Delano Roosevelt ‚Äì set out to create a program to provide peace of mind and a sense of security to America's retirees. During his crusade to create the program, FDR said, "There is no tragedy in growing old, but there is tragedy in growing old without means of support."

<p>The program he created is to this day the single greatest social insurance program in our nation's history. Social Security, as it would be called, has been a resounding success by keeping millions of people out of poverty.

<p>Just months before the new program was enacted, FDR laid out his vision of how this most important program should be implemented.

<p>He said: "We can never insure one-hundred percent of the population against one-hundred percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of life. But we have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection to the average citizen and to his family against the loss of a job and against poverty-ridden old age. This law, too, represents a cornerstone in a structure which is being built, but is by no means complete.... It is...a law that will take care of human needs and at the same time provide for the United States an economic structure of vastly greater soundness." Those were the words of FDR in August, 1935

<p>But today, this cornerstone, this basic American value, is now under attack.

<p>President Bush is currently traveling the country saying Social Security is in crisis and that it needs to be radically restructured. But I rise today to reaffirm the values and spirit FDR laid out 70 years ago.

<p>Social Security has pulled seniors from poverty and put millions of retiring minds at ease. America's insurance program is a guaranteed benefit that all Americans can count on.

<p>It's a promise that if you work hard, you'll have some security when you retire or if you become disabled. It's a promise that seniors won't have to live in poverty. And it's a promise that if your spouse passes on, you will continue to have the support and security you need.

<p>And of course the program is about more than security -- it's about community. In America, we believe that it's important to take care of the generation that came before. It's important to guarantee them a quality of life. And it's important that we guarantee benefits after a lifetime of hard work.

<p>But I'm very concerned that President Bush's "restructuring" will imperil the security of all Americans ‚Äì from young workers retiring in decades to seniors retiring today. The problem with his plan is that:

<p>* It's the end of guaranteed benefits.

<p>* It does nothing to fix the long-term issues the system faces.

<p>* It adds trillions of dollars to our national debt.

<p>* It's dangerous.

<p>We cannot, and will not, let President Bush tear apart Social Security.

<p>While some are trying to enrich Wall Street or push an ideology or force market experiments on senior citizens, our priority in this discussion should be ensuring that we're doing right by those who rely on Social Security ‚Äì from current workers to retirees, the disabled and widows.

<p>Current and future retirees need someone to stand up for them, and if I see something that's going to hurt our workers, our families, and our seniors, I'm going to fight it with everything I've got.

<p>Any discussion about Social Security must meet certain criteria if it means to be productive. You could call it a test ‚Äì and any proposal we discuss must pass this test if it wants to move from this body.

<p>We must:

<p>* Preserve Social Security's guaranteed benefit

<p>* Preserve Social Security's protections for workers when they are disabled

<p>* Protect against benefit reductions for women, minorities and all others

<p>* Protect our budget from ever growing deficits

<p>Anything short of this would be an unnecessary, dangerous gamble unworthy of this important insurance program.

<p>While we‚Äôre just beginning this discussion, my female colleagues and I have worked for years to ensure some basic principles are followed as we move forward. The promise of Social Security is especially important to women because women face unique challenges in retirement. We know that women make less money than men, women leave the workforce to raise families, women live longer, and women are more likely to suffer from a chronic health condition.

<p>Even with those special challenges, Social Security keeps millions of older women out of poverty. Its benefit formulas are tilted to give a greater rate of return for lower wage workers like women and minorities. If the President privatizes Social Security, he would destroy the guaranteed benefit that low-wage earners need in their retirement years.

<p>We also know that Social Security isn't just a retirement program. As I've said, it protects disabled workers and their families. If Social Security is privatized, what happens to a worker who is disabled and can't contribute to her account? Today, under Social Security, that worker is protected. But there's no guarantee under the Bush plan.

<p>President Bush could undo the progressive structure that older women depend on. This is one reform that would have disastrous results, and I know we will not stand for it.

<p>Under this Administration, many things we take for granted from overtime pay to community police to safe drinking water have been threatened. Now President Bush wants to dismantle Social Security. I am here today to say that some things are just too important to American families. Providing real security to all Americans is a basic value worth protecting. We will make sure that President Bush doesn't gamble that security and break the promise Social Security keeps for millions of women and their families.

<p>Senator Murray takes the plunge

<p>U.S. SEN. PATTY MURRAY D-Wash. in today's Bellingham Herald

<p>"IN THE FACE OF skyrocketing health-care costs, ongoing military operations abroad and the challenge of continuing to move our economy forward, the president's top legislative priority is to break the promise that has provided security to millions of Americans for decades. The president's plan to privatize Social Security would actually take away guaranteed benefits and put the promise of a secure retirement in jeopardy."

<p>See Senator, that wasn't so hard.

<p>What's So Personal About Personal Accounts?

<p>There's a lot of talk in the media and the blogosphere over the Social Security language squabbles. Last week privatization was getting swept under the rug. This week it's private vs. personal vs. individual accounts.

<p>But what's so personal about personal accounts?

<p>The argument over what to call them dances neatly right over this point. If all the people who believe the Bush people when they say "It's your money" get clued into the fact that it's not really going to be "their money" and they won't get to opt out and get "their money" under this plan, they'll hardly be anyone left on the administration's side to hold up their banner for them.

<p>According to The Center for Economic and Policy Research's Social Security Review from January 18

<p>"...the White House is not considering allowing individuals the kind of control over these accounts that readers would normally associate with personal ownership. Instead, Plan 2 from the President‚Äôs Social Security Commission, upon which the White House is shaping its proposal, would only offer workers a very limited choice of index funds, into which the government would place their money. Also, the President‚Äôs plan would not allow workers to draw down money from their accounts prior to retirement."
