<h>Tom Fordís Indecent Proposal

<p>We hear flesh-obsessed designer Tom Fordís gig as guest editor of Vanity Fairís Hollywood Issue recently hit a kink.  Sources close to the glossy say demure rising starlet Rachel McAdams stormed out of a November cover shoot for the annual industry mash note‚Äîand fired her publicist‚Äîafter learning Ford expected her to pose nude.

<p>According to mag insiders, Ford had prearranged with McAdamís rep, Wolf Kastellerís Ame Van Iden, for the in-demand Red Eye actress to appear naked in a group portrait of Hollywoodís breathtaking beauties-of-the-moment, alongside Keira Knightley, Scarlett Johansson, and others. (We presume the shoot was conceived along the tasteful lines of Herb Rittsí iconic 1989 supermodel ensemble, ìStephanie Cindy Christy Tatjana Naomiî , but considering Fordís involvement itís possible to imagine a raunchier scenario.)

<p>Unfortunately for legions of mouth-breathing McAdams fans, weíre told Van Iden neglected to brief her family-friendly chargeówho may have been the only actress in Wedding Crashers to keep all her clothes onóabout the concept beforehand. When she arrived on the  L.A. set and found out what Ford had in mind, weíre told she turned tail and promptly fired Van Iden.

<p>ìEvery magazine wants her on their cover and thinks sheís gonna be huge, so she can get away with being picky,î says a CondÈ Nast insider. ìBut everyoneís really impressed that she stood up for herself. Itís kind of amazing, actually.î

<p>While the 29-year-old actressís chaste retreat suggests she has a tad more dignity than the average Hollywood climber, itís odd she was so blindsided by Fordís request. After all, the former Gucci designer has previously told reporters the ìentire issue would be naked,î and his recent work has certainly showcased his fondness for letting it all hang outóhe posed au naturel for a 22-page spread in last monthís W, his new line of cosmetics for Estee Lauder is called Amber Nude, his ad campaign for the fragrance Youth Dew features a naked Carolyn Murphy, and an advertisement he produced for a new line of sunglasses reportedly features porn stars whom he says were paid ìto have sex on set.î

<p>Neither Ford nor VF spokeswoman Beth Kseniak returned calls about the incident. McAdamís manager, Shelley Browning, confirmed that McAdams ìpresently does not have a publicist,î but referred questions about the cover shoot to the magazine.  Van Iden herself did not return calls.

<p>UPDATE: So much for dignity. Even though McAdams fired her publicist for neglecting to tell her she was expected to pose nude, we hear she ultimately decided a VF cover was too good to pass up and returned to disrobe anyway. We also hear Van Iden, her fired rep, wasnít even on set when it happened. A top-tier Hollywood player writes in:

<p>ìAme was absolutely set up by Vanity Fair. No one talked to her beforehand about her client posing nude. (Seriouslyóif they had, she would never have agreed to it). Ame had to cover another clientís shoot in L.A. and sent her counterpart from Wolf Kastellerís New York office to accompany Rachel on the set. When they arrived, [VF celebrity wrangler] Jane Sarkin told Rachel, ëOh, Ame knew all about this and agreed to it,í which was an out and out lie and, moreover, a way to intimidate a young actress into taking her clothes off. Of course, they always blame the publicist, and sweet, mild-mannered Ame got fired by her client for it. Very low-end, nasty stuff if you ask me.î

<p>Is Singerís Superman A Loss For Lois?

<p>Did director Bryan Singerís penchant for casting with the lensman in his pants influence his choice of Brandon Routh to play the Man of Steel in Superman Returns? Ever since the unknown 26-year-old actor‚Äîwhose career highlights consist of a season on One Life to Live and an episode of Will & Grace ‚Äîlanded the part over Warner Brothersí reported favorite Jim Caviezel , fanboy bloggers have been wondering whether the famously beefcake-friendly filmmakerís decision had more to do with his libido than his directorís eye.

<p>Of course, if Singer cast an object of his desire in a role, it wouldnít be the first time. According to Alex Burton, the unknown who played Pyro in Singerís first X-Men blockbuster, he was given the part after a hot-tub session with the director at a Hollywood party. ìBryan created that role especially for me,‚Äù says Burton, who went on to act in exactly zero films post-X-Men.

<p>(Singer, it seems, has a thing for water. Following the filming of Apt Pupil, a number of young male extras on the movie filed lawsuits claiming that they had been bullied into stripping naked for a shower scene and that Singer had held private screenings of the wet ëní wild footage at his home. The suits never reached court.)

<p>Whether or not Routh (ìrhymes with mouth,î according to Newsweek ; ìB.J.î to his friends, according to IMDB ) knows his way around a loofah, early press on the film has only fanned the proverbial flames. As Superman Returns actress Parker Posey told Newsweek (albeit, completely out of context), ‚ÄúPoor Brandon. Heís got everyone touching him all the time. Heís lying on his stomach and heís got five people coming up and pulling his underwear down, sticking their hands up the butt of his suit. I canít imagine what itís like.‚Äù (The article goes on to say that ‚Äúthe biggest issue for the studio‚Äù was what size to make Supermanís ‚Äúpackage.‚Äù)

<p>Further driving chatter on online message boards is the out directorís track record of putting together gay-friendly productions. Kevin Spacey, who has long ducked questions about his sexuality, was the centerpiece of Singerís breakout film The Usual Suspects (he also appears in Superman Returns, as Lex Luthor), and the directorís two X-Men movies‚Äîabout teen superheroes fighting for acceptance (and starring Hugh Jackman, Alan Cumming and Sir Ian McKellan)‚Äîwere widely interpreted as allegories for coming out of the closet. In fact, one particularly out-there bit of gossip making the rounds is that Singer cast Routh specifically because he wanted a closeted actor who could ìcome outî as a political statement-cum-publicity-stunt in the run-up to the movieís June ë06 premiere.

<p>Asked about Routhís path to the silver screen, his publicist at PMK, Simon Halls, said that while he rarely comments on his clientsí personal lives, ‚ÄúI think it only fair to tell you that Brandon is happily involved with his longtime girlfriend, and any claims to the contrary are just plain silliness.‚Äù A rep for Singer did not respond to calls or detailed e-mails seeking comment.

<p>Page Six Cuts And Runs

<p>In the course of writing this column, we receive our fare share of verbose legal threats and understand how annoying it can be to deal with the petulant demands of high-powered attorneys. That said, weíre a bit disappointed to see our good pals at Page Six not only cave under pressure, but pass the buck on to us for their own erroneous reporting. In a retraction published yesterday , the usually on-target scandal sheet apologized profusely for picking up our scoop on Brittany Murphyís untimely split from both her publicist and manager, and parroted her flackís line that the moves were Murphyís decision.

<p>Fair enough. Thereís a reason Marty Singer is the best-paid lawyer in Hollywood. Decidedly un-kosher, however, is the assertion that we attributed the split to a certain declasse episode at a Hollywood party. We didnít. The drug and caiter-waiter-banging-bonanza-of-a-blind item in question appeared in Ted Casablancasís column on E! Online and was subsequently dissected by the readers of Defamer . Although we did link to the item and the Defamer post, we never claimed the anonymous skank was Murphy; only that it didnít reflect well on her image that a large number of her fans seemed to think it was. In Page Sixís defense, when they get something wrong‚Äîas they reliably do with our site address ‚Äîat least theyíre consistent.

<p>Braunstein Victim Calls in Cavalry

<p>While New Yorkís finest chase reporter-turned-ìFire Fiendî Peter Braunstein from strip club to strip club across the Midwest, we hear the depraved journoís victim has been trying to wrest herself free from the latest crime story to grip the local tabs. Sources say a number of the cityís news outlets have recently received legal letters from Lynda Goldman, a high-powered attorneyóand partner at pitbull entertainment lawyer Marty Singerís firm, no lessówhom the former W mag staffer has hired to keep her personal details out of the press.

<p>Though Goldman would not specify which publications have been contacted, she confirmed that she was retained ìto encourage the media to behave in a responsible manner so that this victim isnít victimized further.î The former W stafferówhose identity, while known in media circles, has been kept out of printóhas been keeping a low profile since the Halloween attack, when Braunstein, a onetime co-worker at the fashion glossy, reportedly gained access to her Chelsea apartment by masquerading as a fireman, knocked her out with chloroform, and tied her to a chair before sexually molesting her for 12 hours.

<p>ìIíve been dealing with some issues because weíre very concerned about her privacy while this guy is still at large,î said Goldman. ìItís obviously very disturbing that heís still out there and that heís evaded the authorities for all this time, so any kind of identifying information that could lead him or other people to locate her is a major invasion of privacy that could put her life in jeopardy.î

<p>Among the published details she finds particularly worrisome are where the victim works, where she lives, and even the name of her next-door neighbor, the attorney said. ìAnd thatís not an inclusive list,î she added.

<p>While some have speculated that the victim hired a lawyer to keep her own identity under wraps until she is prepared to go public in some remunerative fashion, Goldman insists thatís not the case. ìI wasnít retained because sheís working on a book or movie or any nonsense like that,î she said. ìI was retained because she was concerned, as anyone would be in her circumstance, about her privacy and her safety.î She added, however, that her client might be interested in telling her side of the story ìsomewhere down the road when this guy is incarcerated.î

<p>Goldmanówho explained she was chosen to represent her client because the two women ìshare a mutual friendîósaid although she herself relies on newspaper reports for developments in the case, she is frustrated by how much info the media-savvy Braunstein might be gleaning from the coverage.

<p>ìSome of the reporting Iíve seen just seems to me incredibly irresponsible,î she said. ìIf Iím reading a report in the press of somebody saying, ëWe just saw him at x location going to all these strip clubs,í donít you think that he reads the papers and says, ëOh, guess I better not go to any more strip clubs?íî Asked whether she had considered the possibility that police had planted those stories to flush Braunstein out, Goldman admitted, ìI donít know what law enforcement does during these situations, but as a citizen reading this stuff, it just strikes me as foolish.î

<p>Regan Flack Fights Back

<p>Publishing seductress Judith Regan has gotten away with her vindictive tantrums in the past, but sources say she may have chosen the wrong foe in her former PR director, Paul Crichton. Friends of the well-liked publicist say he hired an attorney to look into a possible libel suit after Regan dispatched a minion to smear him in the New York Post.

<p>ìPaulís lawyer and his friends are all urging him to sue Regan and [Regan Books parent company] HarperCollins for defamation of character, slander, libel, whatever, for what they said about him in the Post,î says a source close to Crichton, referring to last Wednesdayís Page Six item in which Paula Conwayóidentified as ìRegan Mediaís interim PR directorîóaccused the publicist of clearing his desk ìat like midnightî and sneaking away after being questioned about ìunauthorized spending in his department.î

<p>ìIt was all a lieóhe was never under investigation for anything,î says the source. (HarperCollins reps declined to comment on a departing employee, but a company source confirmed to the New York Daily Newsís Lowdown column that there was never an investigation.)

<p>Furthermore, a top-level Regan Books employee said she didnít know anything about Conway or an ìinterim PR director.î According to our source, thatís because ìPaula is really just a freelance publicist who happens to be a close personal friend of Maureen Regan, Judithís sister.î The two women are also co-authors of a book called The Beauty Buyble: The Top 100 Beauty Products of 2006, scheduled to be published by Reganís imprint next year.

<p>The real reason Crichton decided to leaveóafter shepherding 13 of Reganís books onto the New York Times best-seller listówas that his boss was working him like a Siberian husky in the Iditarod, says our source. Weíre told that the slight, 32-year-old publicist lost 10 pounds after taking on the responsibilities of associate publisher and director of marketing, in addition to his regular duties, when those positions were vacated in July.

<p>ìPaul worked his ass off, but Judith was insisting that he sign a three-year contract at the same pay he was receiving before he took on the additional jobs and, on top of that, move to L.A.,î where Regan recently moved her operations, the source says. ìWhen he called her to say he wouldnít sign and to give notice, she hung up on him. Anyway, you canít blame him for not looking forward to working with Victoria Gotti, Janice Dickinson, and Kimora Leeóall of whom have books coming out next year.î

<p>But while rumors have been circulating that Crichton may want to vent some of his frustrations by writing a tell-all detailing his ex-bossís mean streak and infamous private exploits (like her ill-fated affair with wannabe Homeland Security czar Bernard Kerik; call it, The Devil Wears Nada) the publicistís pal laughs the notion off, saying, ìheís no Bridie Clark.î Another former Regan Books employee, Clark is already hard at work on a roman ? clef about the companyóin which staffers are thinly disguised to skirt her confidentiality agreement, entitled Because She Can. Besides, Crichton may not have much time for writing. Weíre told heís starting a new job next Monday.

<p>Crichton himself could not be reached for comment, and calls to a Regan Books publicist were not returned by press time.

<p>Locklear and Sambora: Liviní on a Prayer?

<p>While no one was surprised to learn of Jessica Simpson and Nick Lacheyís split last week, we hear music biz insiders are buzzing about the possible marital troubles of another, less-stage-managed Hollywood coupleóHeather Locklear and Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora.

<p>Long admired for sustaining one of the arena-rock worldís most stable marriagesótheir eleventh anniversary is later this monthóthe couple recently fell out over Samboraís desire to give their 8-year-old daughter, Ava Elizabeth, a sibling, according to a source close to the band. Weíre told the 44-year-old Locklear, who frequently complains about movie execsí disdain for aging actresses, thinks a second child would hurt her chances at landing the sexy roles she specializes in.

<p>ìShe doesnít want another kid because she thinks sheís Hollywood royalty,î says our source. ìBut Richie is an only child and desperately wants another kid.î

<p>Another strain on the couple is the fact that Sambora has just embarked on a seven-month, 20-country world tour with Bon Jovi to promote their new album Have a Nice Day‚Äîand weíre told the band is doing everything they can to convince him to ìdump [Locklear] and move on.î†

<p>ìThe members of the band never liked her anyway, particularly Jon [Bon Jovi],î says the source. ìThe bandís a bunch of blue-collar stiffs from New Jersey who feel that they got lucky. Theyíre regular guys, and Heather is spoiledóshe still thinks thatís sheís an ingÈnue.î†

<p>But Sambora isnít the only one looking for a way out, we hear. According to our source, Locklear has been ìstepping outî on her husband.

<p>One person the Perfect Man actress has been spotted with frequently in recent months is her ex-husband, M√∂tley Cr√ºe drummer Tommy Lee. As the New York Postís Page Six reported, Locklear invited the tattoo-festooned sex-tape auteur back to her place with six female friends after celebrating her birthday at a Manhattan restaurant in October. Apparently sheís forgiven Lee for his affair with porn star Debi Diamond, the incident that ended their marriage of seven years in 1993.

<p>Asked about the marital issues, a spokeswoman for Locklear and Sambora said, ìThere is absolutely no truth to any of this. They are fine.î

<p>Ahnoldís Foggy Recall in London Libel Case

<p>Californians may not be happy with the lack of transparency in the Governatorís office, but none of Arnold Schwarzeneggerís political dodges quite compare to his slipperiness in dealing with Anna Richardson, a British TV personality who is suing him for libel.

<p>Richardson first became a thorn in Schwarzeneggerís beefy flank when she was quoted in various news storiesóincluding a landmark Premiere magazine article headlined ìArnold the Barbarianîósaying that the actor had pulled her onto his lap and pinched her nipple after a December 2000 interview for her London-based show Big Screen. When Schwarzeneggerís team attacked her in an October 2003 Los Angeles Times story about the then-candidateís wandering handsóclaiming that sheíd hopped on his lap, seductively cupped her breasts and asked, ìWhat do you think of these?î‚Äîthe 35-year-old vicarís daughter filed a libel suit against the governor and two of his associates.

<p>Since then, we hear, the governor and his lawyer, Marty Singer, have tried every lowdown trick in the book to weasel out of the lawsuitóeven going so far as to refuse to accept the service of legal papers for nearly a year, according to a source close to Richardson. (Weíre told Singer only relented after her barrister, Graham Atkins, sent him at least three personal letters demanding that he take the case seriously.)

<p>Schwarzenegger has also tried to distance himself from the suit, saying Sheryl Main (the Columbia Tristar flack quoted in the L.A. Times story, now a member of the governorís communications team) and Sean Walsh (a former campaign spokesman, now director of the state Office of Planning and Research) were not acting with his knowledge or at his behest when they disseminated the slur. Our source says that, in papers filed in his defense, the governor has even denied any official connection to ìCalifornians for Schwarzenegger,î the nonprofit reelection committee that is paying the trioís legal fees. If thatís the case, the governor may want to refresh his memory. According to municipal documents, Schwarzenegger owns Main Street Plaza, the Santa Monica building that houses the committeeís headquarters.

<p>In another curious passage in his defense papers, weíre told that Schwarzenegger ìdenies that he has a history of sexual misconductÖ and the Claimant must prove the grounds on which she alleges that any such history is now admitted or well-documented or was at the time of his election campaign a matter of public knowledge.î While the governor may somehow be under the impression that Brits canít read American publications, which have obsessively covered Arnoldís multiple groping allegations, the governorís own admission that ìwhere thereís smoke, thereís fireî and that heís ìbehaved badlyî towards women have been trumpeted by a dozen UK papers as well.

<p>At least Richardson is having it easier than Rhonda Miller. After the former stuntwoman announced the day before Schwarzeneggerís election that he had grabbed her breasts, Walsh told reporters that Miller had a history of prostitution and drug abuse. Though the allegations were completely untrue, Millerís suit was overturned in court thanks to Americaís defendant-friendly libel laws. (Luckily for Richardson, Brit law puts the burden of proof on the defense in such cases.)

<p>At the end of the day, Schwarzeneggerís maneuvers will probably come to naught. Ever since a judge declared the governor was ìnot peripheralî to the case, experts have predicted that a settlement is the only way for Schwarzenegger to avoid an inconvenient appearance before a judge in a powdered wigóprobably during his 2006 reelection campaign.

<p>Reached for comment, Singer declined to discuss his defense strategy‚ÄîîIím not an English attorney, but Iíve been told that youíre not supposed to comment on papers filedî‚Äîbut denied that he or Schwarzenegger had resisted being served. ìWe resisted jurisdiction,î Singer said. ìThatís why the papers werenít accepted, per se. When the process server came to the office, it was voluntarily accepted. There was no evasion of service.î The high-priced attorney did confirm that there had been ìnumerous communications between me and the plaintiffís lawyer,î but he wouldnít go into detail. As for a settlement, ìwe havenít discussed it,î he said, adding, for good measure, ìYouíre a tabloid reporter, and these are stupid questions.î

<p>A spokesman for the governor could not be reached by deadline.

<p>Paris Hiltonís Ken Doll

<p>We hear Bob Woodwardís not the only respected journalist to have his objectivity swayed by access to the high and mighty. Sources at Us Weekly say the magís West Coast editor, Ken Baker, has gotten a little too close to Paris Hilton, and that his not-so-secret obsession with his number-one source is affecting his coverage.

<p>According to insiders at the gossip glossy, the 35-year-old Baker spends a large part of his day on the phone with Paris, and insists on putting a positive spin on anything published about the heiressómuch to the consternation of his boss, Janice Min. ìI think this goes far beyond a crush,î confides a friend of Hiltonís. ìEvery time her phone rings, itís Ken. He calls more than any other guy, even more than her boyfriends.î

<p>The relationship has clearly benefited Baker, who is seen as something of a wunderkind in the business for his ability to bring in celebrity exclusives. Since Paris first appeared on the national scene in 2003 with her infrared sex tape, Us Weekly has broken the lionís share of Hilton-related scoopsóher break-up with Nick Carter, her harrowing account of her hacked Sidekick ordeal, and her engagement to Paris Latsis. (The coupleís breakup, we broke . US weekly followed up a week later with the ìofficialî story , straight from Hilton herself.)

<p>What could the two possibly be talking about? According to a mag insider, ìParis uses Ken to plant negative items about her enemies, like Nicole Richie.î In fact, one of the memos found on Hiltonís pilfered Sidekickóìtell ken about jess trying to bone JTîówas widely deciphered as a reminder to tell Baker that Jessica Simpson was stalking the wild Timbersnake. (The phoneís address book, conveniently enough, contained Bakerís digits, too.)

<p>Even in public, Baker has made little attempt to conceal his admiration for his prize canary: he once told Fox Newsí Greta Van Susteran, ìWhen it comes to Paris Hilton, you either love her, loathe her, or lust after her, but either way Ö you have to admit sheís fascinating,î and even based a character on heróthe inventively named London Marriottóin his new satirical roman a clef, Hollywood Hussein.

<p>Sadly, the feeling apparently isnít mutual: ìParis thinks itís funny when he calls, and will sometimes taunt and even abuse him,î says Hiltonís pal. ìShe brags that heís obsessed with her and wants to fuck her.î Thatís gratitude for you.

<p>Asked about his special friendship with the hotel heiress, Baker played down his role in bringing home the Hilton bacon and denied there was any ‚Äúquid pro quo‚Äù involved. ‚ÄúParis has chosen to give exclusive interviews to Us on several occasions because, I would imagine, she realizes our young readership is her fan base,‚Äù he said.

<p>‚ÄúAlso, Us Weekly has covered several major news events concerning Paris Hilton with aggressive journalism. For example, we were the only magazine to run a cover on her Sidekick scandal and, most recently, we broke news that Paris had ëstolení Mary Kate Olsenís boyfriend. Iíd imagine Paris would have prefered these stories werenít given so much coverage, but as a news magazine that is our responsibility to our readers.‚Äù

<p>Baker went on to say that the idea Paris toyed with him on the phone was a ‚Äúfiction,‚Äù adding that he hadn‚Äôt interviewed her in over a month. ‚ÄúIf you hear from her, tell her I said ‚Ä?Hi!‚Äô‚Äù

<p>We tried to, but Hilton‚Äôs crisis manager, Elliot Mintz, did not return calls or e-mails, and her publicist, PMK‚Äôs Jack Ketsoyan, was ìtravelingî and could not be reached.
