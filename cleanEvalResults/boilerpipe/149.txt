<h>Knox Media Gossip

<p>SouthKnoxBubba points to media-business gossip in Betty Bean 's Halls Shopper News column, including rumors of the Metro Pulse being for sale and the Knoxville Journal having its own problems.

<p>In response, Metro Pulse owner/publisher Brian Conley (or someone impersonating him) joined the discussion thread at Bubba's site, posting several responses to comments on his downtown redevelopment connections and their relationship to the paper, as well as the Shopper News item:

<p>I'm not "peddling" MP, which is exactly what I would have told Betty Bean if she'd bothered to ask me. And while I may be relatively new at the newspaper business, we at MP do at least make an effort to report accurate information.

<p>As of this writing, there's no response from Betty Bean -- but I'm learning something about local media history, animosities and attitudes from the conversation... reading some of it in the papers, some of it in the blog and some of it between the lines.

<p>I hadn't visited Halls Shopper News before, but found other pieces in it about the Knoxville Journal and local TV stations, both in Betty's column and elsewhere . (I do keep a large salt shaker handy when reading opinion columns and business gossip, regardless of source -- especially when I'm new in town, don't have a scorecard and don't know the players.)

<p>However, while I was at it, I also found this piece about back when the Journal was a daily paper , in the online edition of the Tennessee Encyclopedia of History & Culture at tennesseeencyclopedia.net /, which looks like a fine resource for a newcomer to browse when there's no breaking news.

<p>(The irony is that all of this Web browsing went on while I skipped a Society of Professional Journalists meeting to wait for a UPS delivery -- at least I didn't miss out entirely on opportunities to learn a little more about the local media.)
