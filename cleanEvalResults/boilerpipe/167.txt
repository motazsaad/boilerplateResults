<h>Product and Services Bundling

<p>The study of bundling          can be approached from a variety of perspectives, such as information          processing, transaction cost analysis, and competitive advantage. Specific          research topics include how consumers select between competing bundles          (i.e., how information processing differs when compared to selecting between          individual products), the role of bundling in reducing churn in the marketplace,          and the optimal configuration of the bundle (the number of products in          the bundle as well as the relationship between the products in the bundle)

<p>Relationship          Marketing

<p>In recent years firms have realized that they can leverage their value          chains and achieve payoffs such as lower coordination costs, greater market          access, and the delivery of quality service by initiating, developing,          and enhancing long-term cooperation relationships with suppliers, distributors,          and customers. A sampling of research areas in this field include, relationship          initiation strategies through the use of market-place signals and social/structural          bonds, relationship termination strategies involving hostages, idiosyncratic          (specific) investments, and switching costs, etc.

<p>Information          Processing and Individual Decision Making

<p>The area of information processing borrows heavily from psychology as          well as economics. In recent years, research has focused on dynamic aspects          of consumer preference (i.e., how choices and preferences change over          time), information acquisition and use in Judgments (i.e., how people          search for information and use information in their decisions), advertising          exposure and attitude change (how attitudes are affected by advertising),          and customer satisfaction and loyalty.

<p>Competitive Marketing Strategies

<p>This is an area of immense importance to marketing managers and research in this field requires an understanding of areas outside of traditional marketing such as economics (e.g., game theory) and finance (Capital Asset Pricing Models). One area of study is the wireless telecommunications industry. In this area, one could potentially research how consumers adopt new tecnologies, how should the different telecommunication services be optimally priced given that there are strong cross elasticity across services, and what is the optimum service portfolio.

<p>Judgment        and Decision Making

<p>The study of judgment and decision making is rooted in Behavioral Decision          Theory, or BDT, which studies how consumers form judgments and make choices          in the marketplace. It is often described as a descriptive alternative          to the more normative economic theories of rational choice. In the marketing          context, BDT is applied in areas such as (1) the introduction of new products          and services, (2) judgment and decision making among multi-attribute options,          (3) the influence of market signals on price and quality perceptions,          and (4) the impact of description frames on communication and personal          selling.
