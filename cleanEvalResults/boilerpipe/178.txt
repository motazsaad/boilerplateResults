<p>"

<p>Everyone is unique.  Thus, in a safe environment, I try to understand your particular dilemma and see the world through your eyes. My desire is to empower you to manifest your soul's fullest expression and achieve your goals in work, relationships and health. I treat marital or career problems, anxiety, depression, trauma, grief, chronic pain and illness. I work with those affected by abuse and addiction, and am familiar with 12-step Programs. Formerly a lawyer, I understand work pressures, and aid clients with career stress, goals, and transitions. I mediated divorces and resolved custody disputes in Conciliation Court.

<p>I try to adapt each session to your special needs.  Utilizing dynamic dialogue and cognitive behavioral therapy, clients gain self-acceptance and understanding, catalysts for change.  Sometimes I also use dream interpretation, visualization, gestalt, meditation and hypnosis. With chronic pain, I teach breath, touch and sound techniques to alleviate pain.

<p>In addition to my extensive training, I have years of experience related to spirituality and healing, and have helped many clients through trauma, spiritual and relationship crises, loss and illness. "

<p>  Taking the first step toward getting help is often the most difficult -- please don't hesitate to:
