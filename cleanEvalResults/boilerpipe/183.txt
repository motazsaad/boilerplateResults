<p>Term "Wife Beater" Gains Acceptance

<p>I have never liked calling white t-shirts "wife beaters" for obvious reasons. I've heard too many teenaged boys use the term, and think that it's cool. Unfortunately, Ms. Musings reports that the word has been accepted into the Oxford English Dictionary. Here is what Alison Ward of the Star Telegraph has to say about it:

<p>For at least three decades, the controversial term has been used to describe the ribbed tank top made famous by violent movie stereotypes and the Fox show Cops. Men who beat their wives, the thinking goes, like to spend their spare time drinking beer in thin white undershirts.

<p>The shirt has traveled far beyond its blue-collar roots; celebs have made it sexy. Paris Hilton wears hers with itty-bitty skirts. It's hard to spot Eminem or Kevin Federline (Britney Spears' husband) without one. "Most nights I end up wearing a wife-beater T-shirt and boxers," Jessica Alba told the leering men's mag Maxim.

<p>Newspapers have been claiming since 2003 that "wife-beater's" inclusion in the OED is imminent. But in its February issue, GQ -- a magazine that oughta know its men's fashion terms -- swears the word will be added next month in the OED's quarterly online update.

<p>Jesse Sheidlower, the OED's North American editor at large, confirms this. Well, sort of.

<p>"It's very likely that this is going to appear," he says.

<p>Sheidlower says the dictionary accepts about 250 new words per quarter. The third printed edition of the mammoth OED won't be published for several more years, but the online version -- available by subscription -- serves as an official, ever-expanding substitute in the meantime.

<p>So what makes "wife-beater" a contender? "If something is really common and relatively widespread, it's likely to go in," Sheidlower says.
