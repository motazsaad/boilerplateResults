<p>I did not change my name when I married and I can't imagine how anyone could. To me, that would be like changing my face; it's such a central part of my identity. It was never even a possibility for me.

<p>Plus, I can never remember any of the last names of the few friends I have who have changed their last names. I've even met a few parents who forget what their own daughter's last name is after she changes it! It' actually a bit disturbing when someone changes their name, I'm very attached to permanence. I was also surprised to find how happy it made my father when he found out I was keeping my (and his) last name.

<p>Most men I know seem to think that keeping my last name is admirable. However, my husband's family does not approve. They are too intimidated to say anything to me about it though, and its a good thing, because they don't want to get into an argument with me about a tradition based on women as property!!

<p>Also, when we have a child, it will have my last name. Both parents are generally equal, but I'm the one that has to carry the dang kid in my body for 9 months, so the balance is shifted in my favor. My husband agrees with that logic.

<p>I didn't change my last name when I got married, instead my husband took my last name.   He didn't feel all that attached to his last name since his family is scattered, and he knew that I did feel attached to my last name, so it just seemed like the natural choice for us.  But that being said, had he not been receptive to taking my name I would have taken his, or we might have came up with a different new last name for both of us.   We feel stongly that we have the same name that our kids do.  It just seems easier that way, and I wouldn't want anybody to mistakenly think my child was from a broken home.

<p>Kelly:

<p>I view my name as part of my identity, and while I appreciate the "family unity" argument, I also wasn't comfortable with changing my name just because I got married.

<p>My mother (married in 1969 and a feminist) took Dad's name, and she said it was easier to change her name and it was a man's name anyways.  For me, it's not about it being a man's name, it's about the name I was born with, got used to, practice under and associate myself with. And it also seems a little unfair that the default is that the woman changes her name.  If both change to a new name, that seems much more equitable.

<p>Unlike some women who kept their names, I have no qualms about being called by my husband's last name, and I occasionally offer that name in social settings for convenience purposes. We get mail with all sorts of combinations of our last names. I do not care what other people call me, I am not bothered in the least to be called by his name -- I simply did not want to change my  name professionally or with my friends and family.

<p>Children pose a problem.  There is a family unity issue there (of course, I am no less my husband's wife if I do not share his name, so I am no less my child's mother if I do not share her name), but there's also a convenience issue - you'll have to take extra steps to prove that you're the spouse or mother if your name isn't the same.  Therefore, if we have children, we'll review my decision, and perhaps even choose a new last name for all of us.

<p>FWIW, my name is English and my husband's name is hard to pronounce when read, hard to spell when heard, and is ethnic (and I am not that ethnicity).   He uses my name when we order pizza.

<p>Tracy Wilkinson:

<p>I didn't change my name mostly for practical reasons.  Although my husband's surname is earlier in the alphabet than my own, and is from as good old English stock as my own, no one in New Zealand can spell it accurately.  They also can't spell my first name accurately.  The thought of spending the rest of my life going:

<p>"No 'e' in Tracy.  Yes, there's an 'e' at the end of [hubby's surname].  But not in Tracy.  And there's no 'a' in the surname.  Yes, there is one in Tracy.  Yes, an 'a' but no 'e'.  In Tracy, not in [hubby's surname]. ...'

<p>was just too much for me.

<p>Even my husband makes restaurant reservations in my name.  He started doing that even before he proposed.

<p>There was also the thought of all the hassle of changing my name on all my cards, accounts, email addresses, etc.   And the feminist part of me that said "no one is suggesting that he change his name".

<p>Practically it's worked out fine.  I've never had any problems convincing people that we're married, including when we've travelled overseas.  His family and a few of my friends write letters to me addressed with his last name, and I keep meaning to get around to telling them that I haven't changed it.  Occasionally people comment, but never negatively.

<p>We haven't had kids.  If we do I think I'll give them both names, with my surname as a middle name.  I will also make sure their first names don't have any alternative spellings.  They can use whatever name they like to make restaurant bookings.

<p>As to why their surname first - my husband's surname is unusual and I quite like maintaining diversity.

<p>anonymouse ( mail ):

<p>I have been married for just over two years. I had never considered changing my name. I like my last name; I identify with my father; I'm an only child, and I wanted to keep the name around at least one more generation.

<p>My husband never asked, and it never really occurred to me to change my name. It's also the case that I've published a couple papers, but I don't really respect those publications enough to care. Mostly, I didn't want to be someone else, I wanted to be myself, and I thought that changing my name would make me sad.

<p>Sometimes I wonder sometimes if it wasn't silly of me to keep it. I feel a bit guilty that people refer to my husband as Mr. Mylastname--I'm the one most involved in our community, the one who signs the bills, and many times people here just assume we have the same name.

<p>I haven't thought about the kids' name problem yet.

<p>re: practicality: it's never been an issue for me, but then again, no one misnames me; they misname my husband. Never had any issues with bills or paperwork.

<p>Dawn Park ( mail ):

<p>I didn't change my last name because I was just too darn lazy to go through the hassle of changing all of my documents--driver's license, passport, social security card credit cards, etc..  I'm not particularly attached to my name considering it's an arbitrary transliteration of my Korean name.  Actually, my first name isn't the one I was born with, but rather one that was randomly selected by my sister after we arrived in the states.

<p>I've encountered a small amount of confusion by not having changed my name, but nothing monumental.  Our children have my husband's name because that's convention and I really don't care one way or the other.

<p>Laura ( mail ):

<p>I did not change my name upon marriage because: (1) I had already begun to establish myself as a lawyer with my maiden name;  (2) I liked the sound of my name as it was;  (3) changing my name seemed (and still seems) tantamount to changing my identity.  So, a professional reason, a stylistic one, and a personal one.

<p>No children as of yet, but they will have my husband's name, I suppose.  Socially, I don't think I'll mind being addressed as Mrs. Husbandslastname, particularly if it reduces confusion with the children.

<p>1. I already had publications under my given name.

<p>2. I couldn't be bothered to go through all of the bureaucratic hassle on SSN, credit cards, 401K, etc.

<p>Interestingly, I never thought of it as an identity thing one way or the other, nothing philosophical.

<p>David Has to Add Something Because David's Taken:

<p>Well, I'm not the party to the marriage whom you addressed, but I took my wife's last name. I'm happy to read Jana's note above, as this is the closest I've come to meeting anybody else who's done the same. Why did we do it? We were set on having the same name in order to signal our attachment and make things less confusing for our children and those who encounter them. We seriously considered inventing a new name, especially as a combination of our names, but none of the possible combinations proved very attractive. In the end, she was more attached to her name and family than I was to mine, and her name was also more aesthetically interesting.

<p>dgm ( mail ) ( www ):

<p>I kept my family name because I consider it part of "who I am." I got married when I was 30, but I would have kept the name even in my 20s, before I started on the career path.  I like the sound of it, and had I taken the mate's name, I would have converted my own into something bovine: Donna Bell.  Ugh.

<p>Our two kids have both our last names, which I think makes it easier for future geneologists.  (Besides, my husband insisted they have his last name, too ;-) )I don't buy the argument that we can't signal family unity unless we all share the same name. I think it's pretty clear by our names that we are all from the same family unit.

<p>I think this has worked out well, and I certainly have no regrets about my or my kids' names. Sometimes I have to take a little extra time to explain to people that we all have different but related last names (like when we make airline reservations), but the only time it bothers me is when I have to have the discussion (over and over)with my own friends, especially those who've known me long before I got married.

<p>Incidentally, I'm surprised at how few women have commented on this compared to the number of commenters on your previous post for those who changed their names.  Are we really that much in the minority??

<p>Mr. & Ms.:

<p>I'm going to chime in, despite being the wrong gender, as my wife and I both wrestled with the question of which, if either, of us should change names.  We ultimately decided to keep ours.

<p>Best as I can tell, this has posed a problem once in four years of marriage, and then only a minor one: when checking in at an airport in a small city in the South (and plausible marriage or honeymoon destination), we had this conversation:

<p>Me: We're both checking in, please.  Two bags.

<p>Agent: Which bag is whose?

<p>Me: Oh, it doesn't matter, we're married.

<p>Agent: Oh...the reservations are in different names.  [starts consulting policy manual]  Do you have your marriage license?

<p>Me: What do we need that for?  The tickets match our IDs.

<p>Agent: Aha!  How exciting.  Congratulations!

<p>Me: [confused]

<p>Agent: How long have you been married?

<p>Me: Uh, a bit over two years.

<p>Agent: [confused]

<p>We got our boarding passes and made a speedy getaway.

<p>I see the appeal in the one-name, one-family thing, but it's just not important-seeming enough to be worth the hassle and the inequity.  I suspect that if we have two kids, one will get each name--fairer that way, and I think it can actually be really advantageous for younger siblings not to be automatically lumped with their older siblings.

<p>But I have no objection to going by Mr. [wife's name], either, and I often use her name for reservations (it's easier to spell).

<p>Christine Hurt ( mail ) ( www ):

<p>I married eight years ago and kept my last name.  Our kids have Paul's last name, and contrary to warnings, this has not proved too complicated.  We live in a complicated world of blended families where not everyone has the same last name, so I think the world is used to some texture.  I felt strongly about keeping my name at the time, but over time I can barely remember why.  My daughter (aged 6) wants to change her last name to my last name.  I guess if she wants to when she's older, I don't care, although I think her father might!

<p>Alice Marie Beard:

<p>My husband and I married in 1974. I was 23. I'd never considered any option other than keeping my own name. At the same time, I've always understood and felt comfortable with the knowledge that I am "Mrs. Husband's Name." Our children, 26 and 21, have hyphenated names, with their dad's name first. That way, in case they ever opted to drop my part of their last name, they'd already be alphabetized just fine.

<p>When I was in high school, we had an exchange student from Chile: Adolfo Henriquez y Chacon (a man who has gone on to become a brilliant petroleum engineer). He spent much of his year in that little small town in Indiana explaining his last name to some rather unworldly Hoosier kids. His explanation seemed obvious to me, and it's the pattern I chose to adopt for my children.

<p>There is an advantage to having kept my own name that I never anticipated: It turns out that my Polish DP husband has done quite well in his area of the law. With my own name, I can "fly under the radar." And, when I opt to let people know the connection, I just add "Mrs. Husband's Name" after my name.

<p>Having kept my own name was easier (no name-change forms to file) and has meant that I did not vanish behind a new name.
