<p>Subj:   Run Summary 1010719 (ASDEX Upgrade Similarity)

<p>Physics Run Summary for 1010719, MP 287  Asdex H-mode similarity experiment

<p>Session Leader:  Amanda Hubbard

<p>RF Operators:  S. Wukitch, Y. Lin

<p>Goal:  To make high density, high power EDA H-modes in a shape identical to

<p>that in ASDEX-Upgrade 'Type II ELM' discharges.  This regime,

<p>which was only recently obtained on AUG, appears rather similar to that

<p>obtained on C-Mod when power is increased into EDA H-modes. At reduced powers,

<p>AUG sometimes sees a 'quasi-coherent' mode.  We would like to see if the same

<p>behaviour is observed on the two machines with the same dimensionless

<p>parameters.  We will obtain edge profiles both at threshold and in the steady

<p>H-mode period.  AUG will then try to match the

<p>dimensionless parameters (nu*,beta, rho*) of these discharges.

<p>Plan:

<p>1)  Obtain suitable shape, plasma parameters.  Start with shape from shot

<p>1010605016.  Raise Ip to 1.0 MA, keep Bt at 5.3 T.  L-mode nel=1.1e20 m-2.

<p>Once plasma is obtained, adjust shape to get a better match to AUG pulse 14265.

<p>This will involve increasing the inner gap and the radius of the x-point.

<p>RF should use these shots (3-4?) to tune and condition;

<p>For the last shot we would like a power ramp up to >~2 MW to get the

<p>threshold power, and both L and H-mode tunes.

<p>2) High power EDAs.  Use square wave RF pulse at Ptot=2.5 MW using D and E at

<p>80 MHz (more if we can get it).  Measure pedestals, and fluctuations.

<p>Tune J-port at low power on these.

<p>3)  Add power from J-port (70 MHz), at maximum available power.  This will be

<p>off-axis, which is non-optimal, but should help to raise pedestal temperature.

<p>4) Increase density.  A dimensionless match to the best AUG 'grassy ELM' shots

<p>would correspond to a line integrated density of 4.7e20, higher than our usual

<p>range.  Increase starting density, and probably puff gas into EDA, to see how

<p>high we can get and still maintain a decent, steady H-mode (and couple enough

<p>power).  ECE will probably be cut off, so good ETS data are essential.

<p>Again, use max available power without and with J-port.

<p>4)  Once the 'high density' H-mode has been characterized, use a slow power

<p>ramp to determine the corresponding threshold power and edge parameters.

<p>Results:

<p>We had limited success with this run, primarily due to poor machine conditions.

<p>This was probably a result of the recent vent, combined with the fact that we

<p>were running non-standard shapes, and thus putting power on different vessel

<p>surfaces.  This led to impurity injections and, most critically, to a high

<p>hydrogen fraction (up to 20%) which limited the RF power absorption; H/D

<p>typically increases during each discharge, with Pabs decreasing.

<p>The shape development part of the run went quite smoothly, and we

<p>did get shots which were a very close match to ASDEX Upgrade shapes (see

<p>physics operator summary for details of changes made).  These had elongation

<p>close to our vertical stability limits (k~1.73), and were close to double null,

<p>which may have caused some interaction with upper vessel surfaces, and possibly

<p>also increased H-mode thresholds.  The last AUG shaped shot, 1010719020, is a

<p>good example  (Delta_u=0.34, delta_l= 0.47)

<p>J-port was not available for the run after all, so we ran with typically 2.3

<p>MW at 80 MHz from D and E port antennas.  However, the low absorption means

<p>that the effective power was actually much lower, especially late in the pulse.

<p>We were unable to get any H-modes which had a steady, EDA character.  Many were

<p>ELM-free, with strongly increasing impurities.  (eg. shot 2, 14).  Others, with

<p>lower power and higher radiation, had periodic behaviour typical of Type III

<p>ELMs; the pedestal was very cold (eg. shots 5,13).  On shots 9 and 11 we ramped

<p>the RF up slowly to get threshold data, and found it was over the 2.3 MW

<p>injected); this is very high for these C-Mod conditions.  Making the discharge

<p>more 'single null' had little effect (shot 12).  Lowering the target density

<p>from nel= 0.9 to 0.7e20 m-2, while it had minimal effect on nebar at the RF

<p>onset (1.35-1.4e20m-3 in both cases), resulted in much lower neutral pressure

<p>anda threshold of Prf=1.13 MW (shot 13).  This may be a good point for threshold

<p>comparison, though it was rather early in the ramp. Shot 14 had full RF power

<p>at this density, and resulted in ELM-free H-modes.

<p>In an attempts to favour the EDA regime, Ip was lowered from 1.0 to 0.9 MA from

<p>shot 15 on.  This raised q95 to 4.2.  The rates of density rise did decrease

<p>slightly, though not an obvious EDA regime.  Shot 16 had hints of a weak

<p>quasi-coherent

<p>mode on PCI.  Shot 17 was colder and more ELMy.  From shot 19 Bt was raised

<p>from 5.3 T to 5.6 T, raising q95 still further and a better match to the AUG

<p>target.  This proved more difficult for the RF to match, for reasons not well

<p>understood at least by me, and power was not as steady as the rest of the day.

<p>The density did appear to be getting more steady, and QC modes characteristic

<p>of EDA were seen on PCI.  Shot 21, about 0.75-0.8 secs, may be a good time for

<p>pedestal analysis.  For shot 22, we went back to a standard shape, 800 kA shot

<p>to check we could get EDA there.  We did, but it quickly cooled and reverted to

<p>Type III ELMs as H/D rose.

<p>In summary, as expected, it was more difficult to get steady H-modes in the

<p>lower triangularity ASDEX-Upgrade shape.  However, the poor machine conditions

<p>and low absorbed power undoubtedly were a major impediment, and there were

<p>indications we were getting close.  There was insufficient power to try raising

<p>the density.  Since the discharge development has been successfully completed,

<p>we would very much like to revisit this experiment on a day with better vessel

<p>conditions and all three RF antennas available.

<p>Better; makes it to 1.47 secs.  Three H-modes, and the third is quite steady.

<p>However, H/D at this point is 20%, radiation is high and net power therefore

<p>presumably very low.

<p>Pedestal Te ~ 200 eV; may be in an intermittent ELMy/EDA regime.

<p>For next shot, try to increase RF power.  Asked Stu Zweben to delay D2 puffing

<p>to 1.4 secs.

<p>Disrupted 0.82 seconds.  Two H-modes, not EDA.  Both end due to rapid increase

<p>of Prad.

<p>H/D still very  high, though core heating seems OK in this early period.

<p>Next shot: ramp RF power slowly to get threshold point, and also see if

<p>injections are related to
