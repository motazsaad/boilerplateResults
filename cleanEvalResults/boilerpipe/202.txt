<h>I have blotted  out thy transgressions (broken covenant).

<p>CHART 2

<p> 

<p>The second chart shows the first stage in God's education of His servant race by the revelation of the  details of His law and righteousness in all phases of life. God promised that if Israel  kept the terms of the Mosaic Law Covenant, she would then be fit to bless the world as He  had promised her fathers. At that same time, He warned Israel that the BREAKING of the  laws in the Covenant would lead to the long period of scattering for "seven times." We know that Israel did break the Law  and sinned against God, thus showing their weakness and inability to rise to the high  standard set. They learnt the bitter lesson of their own sinful nature and of the  impossibility of becoming God's servant without supernatural aid.

<p>When the flag of St. Patrick was  added in 1801 to form the Union, it was broken in the middle in order to leave a white  border showing between the red cross and the blue background. The broken cross, of course,  remarkably signified that Israel broke this agreement with God. It showed Israel as a  defective people, whose sin and transgressions were evidenced by their failure to keep  God's Law. It taught Israel the need of an outside Divine aid to mend their own broken  lives - the need of a new creation. The Mosaic Covenant reminded Israel all the time of BROKENNESS, lack of perfection, and it developed in  Israel A NATIONAL CONSCIENCE  OF RIGHT AND WRONG WHICH TO-DAY DISTINGUISHES ANGLO-SAXON PEOPLE FROM ALL OTHER NATIONS. The fact that the cross is RED typifies blood. God allowed certain transgressions of His Law to  be forgiven, provided that Israel sacrificed various animals in death. The animal thus  suffered death INSTEAD OF the Israelite. Yet those animal  sacrifices went on from year to year and never overcame human depravity which caused  death. But through the sacrifices, God gradually revealed His purpose that some day ONE SACRIFICE would be paid which would release Israel,  not only from temporary disease, but from death itself.

<p>The third stage on the chart  shows the NEW COVENANT being put into operation. When Christ  appeared at the commencement of his ministry, John the Baptist pointed to him, exclaiming,

<p>"Behold,  the LAMB OF GOD, which taketh away the sin of the world." - (JOHN 1: 29.)

<p>Lambs had been used in the Old  Covenant for many years as sacrifices to obtain healing and forgiveness. Now the Messiah,  though perfect, would himself suffer death as the one sacrificial lamb for Israel and the  whole world, that finally all might be forgiven and restored from death. Through breaking  the Mosaic law, the nation of Israel died, and their Law showed them why they died as  individuals. They were a people typified by a broken cross. Their only hope lay in the  mercy of God bringing about a new creation. Then came the next stage in their spiritual  education, the grace of the New Covenant, but Israel had to learn first the need of a  Saviour before they would accept him and be in a position to teach the other nations to  way of life.

<p>The third flag of the Union Jack,  the Cross of St. George, is the very shape of the cross of Calvary, showing that it does  repre- sent the New Covenant of total forgiveness to Israel of all her transgressions. It  is a red cross, signifying again a blood covenant. At the last supper, Christ passed  around the cup of wine, saying,

<p>"For  this is my blood of the NEW TESTAMENT (COVENANT), which is shed for many for the remission  of sins." - (MATTHEW  26:28)

<p>Christ thus intimated that his  own blood would be shed as evidence that the price of death had been paid to redeem Israel  and save the world ONCE AND FOR ALL. The way was then clear for God's servant to be  cleansed and made perfect for ministry; and He extends the invitation to Israel to come  back to Him

<p>"I have blotted out  as a thick cloud thy transgressions, and as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for 1 have  redeemed thee." - (ISAIAH 44: 22)

<p>"I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy  sins." -  (ISAIAH 43: 25)

<p>When the cross of England is  placed over the broken cross of Ireland to form the Union, the above scriptures are  dramatically symbolised. The broken cross, which, we have seen, represents the broken  Mosaic Covenant, IS BLOTTED  OUT. In the Union Jack, the  broken portion is still there, but covered up by the cross of England. This perfectly  symbolises the fact that the cross of Calvary covers and blots out the transgressions of  Israel. In spite of the fact that Israel disobeyed God, and broke His laws, resulting in  dispersion, God has promised to "remember their sin no more." How well the completed Union Jack  demonstrates that God has blotted out Israel's transgressions through the death of Christ.

<p>Thus the British peoples, who own  the Union Jack, are particularly the nations of the Covenants, or the "Covenant  People," now rapidly nearing the consummation of their spiritual education and  preparation as God's servant nation. Soon Israel will be fully UNITED WITH GOD as His sons  to bless all nations. When Jacob of old prevailed with God at Peniel, the Lord  changed his name to "ISRAEL" which means "a  prince or son of God."

<p>"And he said unto him, What  is thy name ? . . . Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but ISRAEL , FOR AS A  PRINCE HAST THOU POWER WITH GOD AND WITH MEN AND HAST PREVAILED." - (GENESIS  32: 24-28)

<p>Parallel with the formation of  the Union Jack, more and more of Jacob's descendants have become experimentally sons of  God, truly God's ISRAEL. During the days of England under the  Cross of St. George, there commenced the abandonment of idolatry, and the start of the  Protestant Reformation. In the days of the Union between England and Scotland, there came  the deeper spiritual awakening in the Wesleyan revivals. Then, under the completed Union  Jack, there commenced the world-wide ministry of the Anglo-Saxon Missionary and Bible  Societies. This was accompanied by a fuller Gospel including the truth of the second  advent of Christ, while to-day the Gospel of the Kingdom is being crowned by the  Anglo-Israel awakening, and the outpouring of the Spirit.

<p>Parallel with this progressive  return of Anglo-Saxon Israel to the God of their fathers, there has taken place the  promised multiplication and expansion of the race over the earth to form the  Ephraim-British Commonwealth of Nations, and the Manasseh-American Great Republic. From  1194 to 1606, the period of England under the single cross, the earth was almost  unexplored. Toward the close of this period, the first attempts at colonisation were made  in America. But most important of all, England defeated the Spanish Armada, which gave her  dominion of the sea, the sure foundation of England's future greatness. In the next  period, under the elementary Union Jack, 1606 to 1800, the British Empire was born by the  conquest of India and Canada, and by the annexation of eastern Australia; while the United  States emerged by the Declaration of Independence. Then the third and final period under  the completed Union Jack, 1801 to 1941+ has witnessed the full development of the British  Commonwealth of Nations and the great Republic of the United States of America. We now  look forward to the coming re-union of Britain and America, and to the unification of the  whole house of JACOB-ISRAEL  UNITED WITH GOD, to bless all  nations.

<p>'Tis      thy flag and my flag,

<p>The      best of flags on earth.

<p>So      cherish it my children

<p>It's      yours by right of birth.

<p>Your      fathers fought,

<p>To      raise it to the skies

<p>And      we like them must never yield

<p>But      keep it flying high.
