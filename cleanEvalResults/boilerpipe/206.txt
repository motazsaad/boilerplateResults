<p>Faculty Roster Benchmark Reports

<p>The Faculty Roster          Benchmark Reports application is an interactive reporting tool utilizing          Faculty Roster data. Users have the ability to generate reports in a variety          of ways. For example, users can generate one of the Template Reports and tweak it to view the data according to their own criteria, including creating          comparison groups of institutions. Users can also create their own Custom          Reports, choosing from a large number of permutations of Faculty Roster          fields.

<p>Special Reports

<p>Faculty Roster staff are able to conduct special reports for individuals          whose needs are not met from existing reports. Special reports may vary          from simple analyses requiring minimal programming to complicated analyses          requiring significant time and effort. The charge for a special report          depends on the length of time to complete the analysis, with three hours          as the typical length of time.
