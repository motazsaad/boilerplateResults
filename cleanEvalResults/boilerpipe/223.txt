<p>Eitzel to perform at The American Beauty Project

<p>The American Beauty Project will honor the Grateful Dead’s Dead’s two storied 1970 albums, American Beauty and Workingman’s Dead -- albums comprised of true hymns to Americana, and created during a period in the band's history that they were compared to a Charles Ives village green band -- with two free concerts under the glass atrium of the World Financial Center Winter Garden (directly across the street from the World Trade Center site in lower Manhattan), Saturday and Sunday, January 20 and 21, 2007. Performing their own arrangements of the songs will be Mark Eitzel (American Music Club), Tim O’Reagan (The Jayhawks), Catherine Russell, The Holmes Brothers, Ollabelle, Jay Farrar (Son Volt/Uncle Tupelo), Jorma Kaukonen (Jefferson Airplane/Hot Tuna), Toshi Reagon, Dar Williams, Jim Lauderdale, Jen Chapin, Larry Campbell (Bob Dylan, Phil Lesh & Friends), Andy Statman, The Klezmatics, Tony Trischka, and many more!
