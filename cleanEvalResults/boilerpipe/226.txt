<p>NOTICE! 12/28/2001 Back when Charity gave me permission to list her links, she had found the need to focus her attention at home, rather than on maintaining a website. Although I set out to repair the many links that had gone out of date, I find that life is intervening in way that makes it impossible for me to continue to update this Unit Studies page as well, at least at this time. My brother is now living with us while he fights brain cancer, and our attention is necessarily on his health, wellbeing and happiness. If you find that the unit studies you are interested in are out of date, or the links are broken, try copying the title of the unit and doing a search for it. You can also try searching for the term "unit study". You may be pleasantly surprised. Good luck in your endeavors!!

<p>Finding materials to use in setting up your daily curriculum can be quite a challenge. We are grateful to Charity Lovelace, of Hilltop Homeschool (no longer available after Sept 15,2000, but we can hope she finds time to share her extraordinary talents again), for putting together this long list of Unit Study sites, and kindly allowing us to copy and share it. Although it does not include any of her own, it is a wealth of good ones.
