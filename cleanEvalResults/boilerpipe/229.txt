<p>"Anne Collins Weight Loss Program is one of the best value programs on the Internet. It offers a wide range          of healthy food, uses simple, healthy recipes and wonderful support to          keep you motivated.

<p>What Members Say About          the Forum

<p>"I have literally dieted 38 of            my 48 years and I have learned more in the six weeks since I joined            this group than ever before. Oh, I knew all there was to know about            calories, fat grams, carbs, etc. I could write my own book. What I have            learned....actually, what I am learning is about self-image, positive            attitude, etc. I knew all the physical stuff but here I am learning            about the mental part of weight loss. I am finding out that is an essential            part of any weight loss program."

<p>"Boy, I love this forum. You can't get this kind of treatment anywhere            else, and believe me I have tried WW, Curves, Jenny Craig, everything.            Nothing beats Anne. I want to eventually get to 150 lbs. I will be happpy            if I just break the terrible 200 lb mark. I haven't seen that in almost            18 years when I had my last child."
