<h>The Use of Storytelling in the Department of the Navy (local copy)

<p>Conveying information in a story provides a rich context, remaining in the conscious memory longer and creating more memory traces than information not in context. Therefore a story is more likely to be acted upon than normal means of communications. Storytelling, whether in a personal or organizational setting, connects people, develops creativity, and increases confidence. The use of stories in organizations can build descriptive capabilities, increase organizational learning, convey complex meaning, and communicate common values and rule sets.

<p>Description capabilities are essential in strategic thinking and planning, and create a greater awareness of what we could achieve. Fictional stories can be powerful because they provide a mechanism by which an organization can learn from failure without attributing blame.

<p>With the advent of the Internet and Intranet, there is a larger opportunity to use stories to bring about change. Electronic media adds moving images and sound as context setters. Hypertext capabilities and collaboration software invites groups, teams and communities to co-create their stories. New multiprocessing skills are required to navigate this new world, skills that include the quick and sure assimilation of and response to fast-flowing images and sounds and sensory assaults.

<p>In summary, when used well storytelling is a powerful transformational tool in organizations, one that all of our managers and leaders across the Department need to utilize.

<p>NASA's ASK Talks with Dr. Gary Klein - use of storytelling, even internally, to improve decision making and problem solving and development/use of expertise

<p>According to the theory, the story coordinates three types of knowledge:

<p>facts or information from the current situation

<p>knowledge about similar situations

<p>generic expectations about what makes a complete story, such as believing that people do what they do for a reason

<p>Given a set of known facts in an unfolding situation, knowledge about similar situations, and expectations about what is needed to make a complete story, the decisionmaker can know when important information is missing, and where inferences must be made.

<p>Construct a story

<p>Evaluate story for coverage - concerns the extent to which the story accounts for evidence

<p>Evaluate story for coherence

<p>consistency - concerns the extent to which the story does not contain contradictions

<p>plausibility - concerns the extent to which the story is consistent with real or imagined events in the real world

<p>completeness - concerns the extent to which a story has all of its parts

<p>Storytelling that moves people. A conversation with screenwriting coach Robert McKee , abstract with PubMed, at National Library of Medicine

<p>In this conversation with HBR, Robert McKee, the world's best-known screenwriting lecturer, argues that executives can engage people in a much deeper--and ultimately more convincing--way if they toss out their Power-Point slides and memos and learn to tell good stories. As human beings, we make sense of our experiences through stories. But becoming a good storyteller is hard. It requires imagination and an understanding of what makes a story worth telling. All great stories deal with the conflict between subjective expectations and an uncooperative objective reality.
