<p>If eyes are the window to the soul then the skin around them is the true confession of age, stress, eating habits, and more. This unfortunate fact is the result of the eye's minimal support structure. "The tissue around the eye is the shallowest tissue on the face. And because it does not have oil glands or a fatty layer, it is more susceptible to wrinkles and the effects of aging," says Michelle Ribadeneira, a former Estee Lauder beauty advisor.

<p>Skin care professionals agree that products specifically created for the eyes are the only way to treat the delicate area. Says Ribadeneira, "Traditional face products are too heavy for the eye, as a result they clog pores and create bags and wrinkles."
