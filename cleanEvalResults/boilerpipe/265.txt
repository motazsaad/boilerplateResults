<h>York                    between the Art Gallery and the Minster

<p>What's                    the number?

<p>Don't                    book, enjoy the bar! (01904 637722)

<p>What's                    the grub like, then?

<p>Plunketts                      is part of a Christmas tradition with us. We first visited                      years ago and have returned regularly (always at Christmas                      time) on our (at least) biennial shopping visit to York. The                      food is always excellent and the steaks are cooked just how                      you order them. I can also speak very highly of the 'bowl'o'red'!                      This time round we tried the Christmas cake and Godminster                      for dessert, and for a strictly Cheddar-only man like me this                      was a real treat - Fantastic! However having since purchased                      some of the aforementioned cheese I have been disappointed                      not to be able to achieve the same kick.

<p>What                    did you drink?

<p>Black                    Sheep. Its as much a part of the tradition as admiring the view                    through the bedsit window across the street from upstairs, or                    banging my head on the low beams.

<p>What's                    the crowd like?

<p>Sadly                    the clientele appear to be getting younger; I say 'appear' because                    I am a realist and suspect that age wise I now have more in                    common with the fabric of the building than some of the punters!

<p>And                    the vibe?

<p>Soapbox                    time! Apart from it's everpresent inbuilt charm and ambience,                    on this occassion I was put off (upstairs at least) by the fug                    of smoke. The truth is I don't often get out these days and                    to have an evening as special as this marred (not exactly spoiled)                    by something as blatantly antisocial (its only social to those                    who enjoy it) was a tad upsetting. No doubting where I stand                    on the great debate then!

<p>Anything                    else you'd like to say?

<p>If                    you should visit in the week before Christmas be sure to have                    a seat next to the roaring fire! Only my wife likes to sit next                    to the window in the bar to see the Minster - so do I, of course!

<p>Value                    for money?

<p>Always!                    We shared the dessert and still couldn't manage it!
