<p>Moving Home

<p>By Boxes and Bubbles Ltd

<p>Here a just a few tips on how to maximise the efficiency of using your          packaging products for moving home.

<p>Try not to leave packing your removal boxes until the day of your home move. Ideally you want to have everything            boxed up and ready to go as soon as your estate agent has called you            to release your new keys. Packing your cardboard            boxes with items that you don’t use on a daily basis can be            done as soon as you know that contracts have been exchanged.

<p>Get hold of good quality packaging products for moving home, in particular            strong, cardboard boxes . Make sure you            have a good selection of packing boxes in different sizes for the job            in hand. You’ll need medium sized cardboard            boxes for small, heavy items such as books (if you fill a large            box with heavy items it becomes too heavy to lift). Large            removal boxes can be filled with lighter, bulky items. Bed linen            and duvets are best packed in Tea Chest storage            boxes . The best scenario for very large items such as television            sets will be to use their original cardboard            box . If you don’t have this, use plenty of bubble            wrap and make sure you tie up the cable to avoid tripping over it            on the way to the van. Remember to tape the remote control to the inside            of the packing box.

<p>Don’t just throw your clothes in bin bags. Make life easier            for yourself (and the removal people) by simply transferring your clothes            to a Cardboard Wardrobe . This will keep            your clothes clean and crease free during transit. In addition, the            space at the bottom of the cardboard wardrobe is handy for storing shoes            and handbags.

<p>Protect you mattresses with mattress            covers . These thick, heavy duty plastic covers will prevent your            mattresses getting scuffed or marked. Because of their size, mattresses            are easily damaged. Packaging products such as mattress covers can also            be used for covering sofas and chairs particularly if the weather is            wet on your removal day. When you get to the other end, they can be            either left on the mattress to prevent moisture damage or used as large            rubbish bags.

<p>Wrap china, crockery and glass in acid            free tissue paper . This will help prevent the dulling of your china            and once sealed safely in a cardboard box, will protect it during your home removal.

<p>What about your best crystal or the bottles of wine in your rack?            You’ll need to keep these separated during transit to prevent            them banging together and breaking. Special bottle boxes designed specifically with this in mind are available            and come with dividers that separate each item. Adding tissue paper or bubble wrap to this            equation will give you extra peace of mind during your removal.

<p>Make sure you have plenty of tape and            a tape gun – absolutely essential for sealing cardboard boxes            quickly and securely.

<p>Utilities

<p>Make sure that you have informed each of these utilities companies that          you are moving home and if possible, see if you can get the account simply          changed over rather than having them cut off. This will save your buyers          having to pay re-connection charges once they move in.
