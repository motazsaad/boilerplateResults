<p>The Perfect Cup of Coffee

<p>Today  coffee is  a fashion  accessory, and  every self respecting follower of  fashion should have their  own Gaggia - or  similar espresso machine as part of their home design.

<p>Coffee is an integral part  of breakfast - it has replaced beer as the staple  breakfast drink and the very sight  of a coffee pot with its heady aroma of  freshly brewed coffee makes the statement of good hospitality - enjoy.

<p>Ingredients

<p>There are a number of coffees to impress your breakfast guests.

<p>CAPPUCCINO - 1/3 strong coffee, 1/3 steamed milk, 1/3 frothy milk.

<p>Cappuccino is so named as it  resembles  the colour of the hooded robes of the Cappuccine monks in Italy.

<p>ESPRESSO - small cup of very strong coffee.

<p>CAFFE LATTE- double espresso  topped up with  steamed milk in  a glass.

<p>CAFÉ CON PANNA -double espresso  topped with a swirl  of whipped cream.

<p>CAFÉ MOCHA -strong black coffee mixed with rich chocolate syrup, steamed milk topped with whipped cream & dusted with cocoa powder.

<p>note - Coffee picked in Mocha in the Yemen is rich and dark with a hint of chocolate in it's taste - hence 'mocha.'

<p>CAFÉ FRAPPE- (iced coffee) -  chilled double espresso, whizzed with equal amounts of cold milk and two scoops of good coffee ice cream.

<p>A good tip is to make ice cubes  out of the left over coffee. They will chill the drink without diluting it.

<p>DECAFFEINATED coffee is made from  normal beans that are so soaked as to remove about 97% of the  caffeine with only a little loss to the flavour.

<p>INSTANT COFFEE-Better  to drink this than no coffee  at all - but it's rather like settling for the  house wine in a good restaurant rather than savouring the delights of the fine wine list.

<p>With Cafebars now a fashion item in the High Street, they have developed their own slang :

<p>'dry' - extra foam

<p>'harmless' - skinny and no fun

<p>'wet' - extra steamed milk
