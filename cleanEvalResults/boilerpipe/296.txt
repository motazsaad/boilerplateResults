<h>The basics

<p>Being an undergraduate student involves two main expenses: tuition fees and living expenses.

<p>We classify all students as UK, EU or international for fees purposes. The amount you will pay  for tuition fees and the financial support available to help you with this will depend on your fees classification,  which will be determined in accordance with the Education (Fees and Awards) Regulations 1997.  You will find further information about these Regulations at the following web address: www.bristol.ac.uk/academicregistry/fees/class.html .

<p>If you are from the UK or the European Union (EU), your tuition fee for any course at Bristol will be £3,000  in 2006/07. The vast majority of other universities will be charging the same. The fee will go up by inflation in  each subsequent year. You will not have to pay the money before or during your time at the University. You will only  have to start repaying it after you have graduated and are earning more than £15,000 a year. The rate at which you  repay the fee will be linked to your income.

<p>Information about tuition fees for international students and for students from the Channel Islands or Isle of  Man appears at www.bristol.ac.uk/academicregistry/fees .

<p>Whether you are a UK, EU or international student, your living expenses will mainly include accommodation  (unless you are a UK student living rent-free at home), food, entertainment and books. You can get a good idea of  the cost of accommodation from the University's Accommodation Office .  Your other living expenses will depend to a large  extent on your way of life. At present, most students spend something in the region of £6,000 to £8,000 a year on  their living expenses, including accommodation.

<p>If you are thinking of applying to study at Bristol, please don't be put off by the cost of studying and  living here.  There is help for UK/EU students who need it, both from the Government and the University.

<p>Tuition fees

<p>UK/EU students will not have to pay tuition fees before or during their studies. This is because the Government  can give you a student loan for the full amount and pay it direct to the University.

<p>UK students will have to apply for their loan from their Local Education Authority.  The following website can  give you more information: www.dfes.gov.uk/studentsupport/ .

<p>EU students should contact the Government's EU team at EUTeam@dfes.gsi.gov.uk , or visit www.dfes.gov.uk/studentsupport/eustudents/index.shtml .

<p>Government help with living costs – Student Loan

<p>The Government can give UK (but not EU or international) students a student loan to cover living expenses.    The maximum loan is £4,405 for students living away from home, outside London and £3,415 for students living at home.  These figures will change slightly each year so its worth checking the Government website www.dfes.gov.uk/studentsupport/ for up-to-date information about what will be available the year you start University.  Eligible students will be able to get 75% of the maximum loan  whatever income they or their family have. The other 25% will depend on income and how much maintenance grant you  receive.

<p>To apply for the student loan for maintenance, contact your Local Education Authority – see www.dfes.gov.uk/studentsupport/ for more guidance.

<p>Your student loan for maintenance will be combined with your student loan for tuition fees and you will start repaying both together after you have graduated and are earning more than £15,000 a year.

<p>Government help with living costs – Maintenance Grant

<p>From September 2006, new full-time UK students from low-income homes will be eligible for a maintenance grant of  up to £2,700 a year. This does not have to be paid back. The amount you get will depend on your income and that of  your household.  Here is a guide, although the figures will probably change:
