<p>Is                the packaging used for soft drinks recyclable?

<p>All                packaging used by the soft drinks industry can be recycled and/or                re-used to make other useful products. For example:

<p>aluminium                  cans are recycled and used with raw material to produce new batches                  of cans;

<p>plastic bottles                  can be used to make fleece textile products, fibre filling and                  street furniture;

<p>glass bottles                  can be reused or recycled to use in the production of new glass;                  and

<p>paper and                  board is recycled to produce tissue, paper bags, chip board, briefcases                  and office furniture.

<p>What do soft                drinks companies do to reduce the amount of materials they use to                contain their products?

<p>The                soft drinks industry is at the forefront of packaging innovations                and is constantly looking at ways to reduce the amount of raw materials                used in various types of packaging. This process of "lightweighting"                means that not only are fewer materials being used, but savings                are also being made in terms of the energy required for the manufacture                and distribution of products. Today, the average can uses 35% less                aluminium than 10 years ago, with steel cans containing 50% less                steel and average PET plastic bottles containing 25% less PET.

<p>What are                the most popular types of packaging used to make soft drinks?

<p>The                main forms of packaging used by the soft drinks industry are:

<p>glass bottles

<p>plastic including                  PET (Polyethylene terephthalate), PVC (Polyvinyl chloride), HDPE                  (High density polyethylene), cups (made from polystyrene and polyethylene),                  pouches (low density polyethylene)

<p>cans including                  aluminium and steel

<p>paper such                  as cartons

<p>Drinks come                in many different types of packaging. Why are certain products packaged                in some forms and not others?

<p>When                manufacturers are considering packaging for a soft drink they need                to consider the functions of packaging to ensure that the products                reach the consumer in the best possible condition. The functions                of packaging are to contain, protect, identify and sell the product                bearing in mind the impact upon the environment and the costs involved.

<p>Certain                packaging is more suitable for certain types of product than others                when you consider the above criteria. A summary of the various attributes                and disadvantages of the main forms of packaging when looking at                their functions is detailed here in PDF                format .

<p>What have                been the most important developments in terms of packaging for the                soft drinks industry?

<p>There                have been many varied developments in terms of packaging ranging                from lightweighting of different packaging, to the introduction                of new materials. For example the glass bottle is the traditional                soft drinks container. Originally this was heavy and bottle shape                was limited. Improvements in glass bottle design resulted in the                introduction of the lightweight glass bottle.

<p>Since then the industry has enjoyed the introduction of PVC and PET bottles,                which enabled moulding of the bottles into various shapes, and the                advent of the aseptic filled paper carton. In addition to this there                has been the introduction of various closure systems to meet the                needs of customers for the different forms of packaging.
