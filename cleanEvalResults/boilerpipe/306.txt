<h>Postal Code   to top of page

<p>The postal code is an integral part of every postal address in Canada. The postal code was designed to aid in sorting mail by both mechanized and manual methods. It also enables the Customer to presort mail, thereby bypassing a number of sorting processes within Canada Post and reducing costs.

<p>The Structure of the Postal Code

<p>The postal code is a six-character uniformly structured, alphanumeric code in the form “ANA NAN” where “A” represents an alphabetic character and “N” represents a numeric character. A postal code is made up of two segments: “forward sortation area” and “local delivery unit.”

<p>The forward sortation area is a combination of three characters (alpha-numeric-alpha). It identifies a major geographic area in an urban or a rural location.

<p>The local delivery unit is a combination of three characters (numeric-alpha-numeric). It identifies the smallest delivery unit within a forward sortation area.

<p>Forward Sortation Area ? The First Segment of the Postal Code

<p>The “forward sortation area” or “FSA” represents a specific area within a major geographic region or province. The forward sortation area provides the basis for the primary sorting of forward mail.

<p>The first character of the forward sortation area segment identifies one of the 18 major geographic areas, provinces or districts:

<p>The second character of the forward sortation area is an important component of mail preparation as it identifies either:

<p>an urban postal code: numerals 1 to 9 (E2J). Urban postal codes are generally serviced by Letter Carrier or community mailboxes; or

<p>a rural postal code: numeral 0 (zero) (A0A). Rural postal codes are serviced by rural route drivers and/or postal outlets.

<p>The third character of the forward sortation area segment (E2J) in conjunction with the first two characters, describes an exact area of a city or town or other geographic area.

<p>Local Delivery Unit ? The Second Segment of the Postal Code

<p>The “local delivery unit” or “LDU”, identified by the last three characters of the postal code, allows for a more final sort within a forward sortation area.

<p>In urban areas, the last three characters may indicate a specific city block (one side of a street between two intersecting streets), a single building or, in some cases, a large-volume mail receiver.

<p>In rural areas, the last three characters, together with the forward sortation area, identify a specific rural community.

<p>Postal Code Address Data

<p>Canada Post’s postal code address data is used to determine or verify the correct postal code for an address anywhere in Canada or identify the complete range of addresses that correspond to any one postal code. The data is available by download from a secured Canada Post FTP site, on CD-ROM or IBM cartridge, and is updated and distributed monthly.

<p>Address Accuracy Program   to top of page

<p>Address Accuracy is a program designed to improve delivery by encouraging Customers to accurately address mail. Every item must be addressed to a specific individual or company. In the case of Addressed Admail and Catalogue Mail, items may also be addressed to a non-personalized descriptor, such as "Occupant" or similar wording. Every item must display a complete mailing address including any required suite or unit information as well as the valid postal code for that address. If the mailing address is not complete, the mail may be delayed or returned.

<p>Consistent and accurate addressing eliminates the need for extra handling and/or redelivery. For Customers, this translates into a more efficient service and lower costs. Accurate addressing helps ensure the mail is delivered on time, every time.

<p>Participation in the Address Accuracy Program is mandatory for all Machineable, Letter Carrier Presort (LCP), and NDG Presort mailings greater than 5,000 items.

<p>The standard for Address Accuracy is 95%. This means that 95% of the addresses on the Customer's database are determined to be valid. This is done by using a Canada Post recognized address validation and/or address validation and correction software. If the percentage on the Statement of Accuracy (SOA) produced by the software is less than 95%, an adjustment will be applied to the mailing.

<p>Customers must record their Address Accuracy percentage and expiry date obtained from their Statement of Accuracy (SOA) on their Order (Statement of Mailing). Failure to record the Address Accuracy percentage and expiry date on the Order (Statement of Mailing) will result in the application of a surcharge.

<p>Customers are requested to keep a valid copy of the Statement of Accuracy (SOA) on file in the event that Canada Post requests a copy.

<p>In the case of Incentive Lettermail, Address Accuracy applies to Low Density Presort and Machineable mailings greater than 5,000 items, as well as to High Density Presort mailings greater than 500 items deposited in a Letter Carrier office. Customers who deposit Short and Long (S/L) High Density Presort mail in non-letter carrier offices (not serviced by letter carriers) for delivery within that same office, are exempt from the Address Accuracy requirements. All other requirements to access the High Density Presort service option must be adhered to.

<p>More information on the Address Accuracy Program can be found in the Address Accuracy Program Customer Guide, on the Canada Post website at www.canadapost.ca/address_management or from a Canada Post Representative.
