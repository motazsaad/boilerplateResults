<p>Put deposits on a credit card. Run from automobile dealers who "only take checks."

<p>Angry Emails We Get From New Car Dealers: The Good, The Mad, The Ugly

<p>I get email from new car dealers, some professional, offering disagreement, some give us more info, saying they wish the bad seeds were not ruining it for everyone:

<p>Hi Jeff,

<p>I stumbled onto your website, and you have great information!! I've been in the car business for 12 years 11 of which have been at the same dealership. I've never heard or seen of some of the things that you say to look out for (credit insurance slipped into leases, hiding trades, etc.). Have you received e-mail that this goes on (within the last 5 years )? I'd be curious to hear from you about some of these things. Again, congrats on a well informed web site, and look forward to hearing from you. Sincerely, Paul Albert, Sales Manager, Bob Sharp Nissan

<p>Nice guy, he knows we're here to help. Then I got this one below, also a Nissan dealer. Big difference in attitude, showing what some new car dealers think of you. He's from the old school of selling new cars.

<p>Dear Idiot,

<p>I invite you to spend a week in my dealership to see how things really work. Price does not sell cars, the car itself does. If some one really loves a car they will pay a premium price for that vehicle. And normally they are the happiest of all customers. The goofball who comes in with all of the internet info., consumer reports printouts, and a chip on their shoulder saying "I WILL NOT GET SCREWED!!!!", are the people that we always have the nagging problems with. The only thing I can say to you is to get some expirience from the other side before shooting your mouth off, it just makes you look that much less intelligent. Unsincerely yours.

<p>That should be "insincerely yours". I guess he is not a big fan of Cars.com or InvoiceDealers I thought customer service and not referring to us as "goofballs" sells new cars. Welcome to the new way of selling autos.

<p>I have got to tell you that I absolutely LOVE your website. The messages from certain "Dealers" are priceless. I am a General Manager from a small  family-owned car dealership located in Kansas, and everything you write (or rant) about is exactly what all of us need to hear (Customers and Dealers alike).

<p>The days of over pricing our product and tricking people into making decisions that aren't right for them are over. The true Car "Retailers" are posed to change the status quo. Thank you for the education you provide "My" customer. Not everyone in this business is scared of you (rather they embrace your perceptions of our business). Great Job and keep up the good work!!!

<p>DEAR JEFF,

<p>i AM A FINANCE MANAGER AT A VERY LARGE DEALERSHIP. i HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS FOR YOU.

<p>1) DID YOU ASK YOUR BUTCHER TO SELL YOU YOUR STEAK AT HIS COST?

<p>2) HOW MUCH DO YOU MAKE FROM SCARING PEOPLE OUT OF GOING TO THIER LOCAL DEALERSHIP?

<p>3) WOULD YOU LIKE TO PUT THE SHOE ON THE OTHER FOOT AND TRY TO MAKE A LIVING IN A BUSINESS THAT PEOPLE LIKE YOU GIVE A BAD NAME AND MKE MORE MONEY THAN I DO FOR DOING IT.

<p>NOW JUST A COUPLE COMMENTS. YOU WOULDN'T LAST A DAY ON MY SALES FLOOR. IT HAS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT ALL INTERNET SHOPPERS SHOP ON THE INTERNET BECAUSE THEY  ARE TO SCARED TO COME NEGOTIATE WITH THE BIG, BAD CAR SALESMAN. AUTOMOBILES ARE THE ONLY PRODUCT IN AMERICA THAT THE PROPRIETOR IS REQUIRED TO LIST THE MSRP ON  THE WINDOW. tHE GALLON OF WATER YOU PAY TWO DOLLARS FOR COSTS THE STORE 19 CENTS. HOW MUCH WATER DID YOU BUY LAST YEAR? PEOPLE LIKE YOU ARE THE ONES WHO  GIVE THIS BUSINESS A BAD NAME. AND THATS WHAT IT IS, A BUSINESS. WE ARE HERE TO MAKE MONEY. DO YOU GET UPSET WHEN YOU GO TO A RESTARAUNT ANDPAY FIFTEEN DOLLARS  FOR A STEAK THAT COST THEM THREE? PEOPLE LIKE YOU MAKE MY LIFE MISERABLE. I HAVE A JOB TO DO, AND LITTLE JERK-OFFS LIKE YOU MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE YOU LEAD  ALL THE OTHER JERK-OFFS WHO HAVE NO CLUE HOW TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES.

<p>Someone's grouchy. I like how he says people like ME give the  new car business a bad name. The vehicle market had that stigma before I came around. I'm giving new car buying a good name. We don't scare people out of new car dealers, we send hundreds of confident  new vehicle buyers into dealers through Cars.com or InvoiceDealers , so he has no clue. Big difference between a $15 steak and a $25,000 new SUV or car with $1500 of overpriced fabric protection, VIN# etching, "lifetime" wax jobs and alarms.

<p>From: Steve

<p>What do you know about buying cars? well i am a car salesman. you people think you know everything!! selling cars is my profession!!!! that is my living. i  dont scam anyone you people think that you can get the car for free. well you cant(surprise)! let me ask you this,when you go shopping for food do you tell  thecashier that you will give them 50 cents for that 3.00 package of meat?even though there is a 300% mark up margin in you food!i didnt think so!!! you tell  the cust. to go on kelly blue book and see what there trade in is worth. kelly blue book is false!!!(suprise) call kelly blue book ane see if they would buy  your car for that ridiculious price!! i didnt think so. its websites such as this one that give the cust the wrong impression on how to buy a vehicle! please if  you dont know anything about the car buisness dont put garbage up like this S***!!  if thats all you have to do is badmouth the dealership then get a F***ING LIFE!!!!

<p>p.s. I BET YOU WONT POST THIS!!!!!

<p>I cleaned up Mr. Mature's words with a ****. Why is it that whining salespeople complain "I never argue the price at the grocery  store?" I think they all read took same ineffective vehicle sales course. This guy's a real Einstein. Grocery store managers are laughing at him, with his uneducated  claims of 300% profit. Grocers only make 1% to 3% profit. We don't ask grocers to drop the price on an 89 cent can of peas. We use coupons, or buy it at a cheaper store. When a store sells you a steak, they don't lie about your credit score; force you to buy VIN# etching; or a steak warranty you didn't want. Mr. Autos thinks we know nothing? That's why our visitors report new car savings of $2000-$3000 after using our automotive buying advice and savings over $4000-$6000 on new SUVs, trucks and minivans.

<p>Subject: YOUR WEBSITE

<p>COMING FROM A DEALER YOUR WEBSITE IS COMPLETELY FULL OF BULL****. YOU CRY BABY, YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE BEEN TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY THE BIG BAD CAR DEALER AT SOME POINT IN YOUR LIFE. GROW UP.

<p>I had to clean up Mr. Mature's words with a ****. Would you buy an SUV or minivan from him? He saw I posted his last email:

<p>Subject: HEY YOU F**K FROM THE LOCAL DEALER

<p>BOO HOO BOO HOO, you put my letter on your website, good for you, so you must be proud of yourself for saving everyone so much money. Why don't you make a site for the local MALL and give them all a hard time for marking up THEIR products?? You won't because people expect to pay a profit to those stores, why shouldn't they pay a profit for our product?? Because web sites such as yours give the PUBLIC a bad name with car dealers so we can just hate each other until infinity. The funny thing is, the easy going people who do let us make a profit are the ones that we treasure the most, not all because of money, but instead because they are nice people and don't expect something for nothing like the losers that enter your site. ALL OF YOU STAY AWAY FROM MY STORE, I HAVE NO INTEREST IN SELLING YOU A CAR!!

<p>I can imagine his slogan: "We add the "vice" in Service". I mention shopping malls? This is CarBuyingTips.com , not a site on malls. Automobile dealers complain that we tell you to offer 3% dealer profit, while shopping malls earn 10%. I'd rather own an auto dealership  with 3% of a $25,000 sale than  a mall store with 10% of a $4000 sale. You do the math. Many visitors, after seeing his emails,  flamed him. After he begged me, I  deleted his auto dealership email address, he couldn't take it anymore.

<p>Subject: YOU POSTED MY LETTER ON YOUR SITE AHOLE

<p>LET YOUR IDIOT INTERNET FREAKS KNOW THAT I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT THE CAR BUSINESS. THEY WRITE ME THESE LETTERS THAT ARE SO PATHETIC ABOUT THIS AND THAT AND THEIR PATHETIC LOSER LIVES. THEY ACTUALLY TAKE TIME OUT OF THEIR DAY TO TELL ME HOW UPSET MY POSTING MAKES THEM. I DON'T GIVE ONE F***ING IOTA. I WANT TO MAKE AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE ON EVERY CAR AND IF THEY DON'T LIKE IT, TOO BAD. WE ARE THE BIGGEST AND BEST DEALERSHIP WITH THE HIGHEST CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND YES WE MAKE MONEY, ALL DAY LONG. SO TELL YOUR RETARDED INTERNET F*** HEADS THAT IF THEY DON'T LIKE IT THEY CAN SUCK IT. EVERY EMAIL I GET IS WRITTEN BY SOMEONE THAT REMINDS ME OF FORREST GUMP. STUPID IS AS STUPID DOES YOU IDIOTS. LEAVE ME ALONE, AND IF I RESPOND TO YOU DON'T BE SUCH A PUSSY, WRITE ME BACK, BUT OF COURSE THEY NEVER DO BECAUSE THEY GOT THE POINT. I'LL BE THINKING OF Y'ALL WHEN YOU ARE IN FINANCE GETTING GROSSED FOR MORE THAN YOU CAN SPEND BECAUSE YOU ARE ALL IMPULSE BUYING CRAZY ASS CRY BABIES

<p>My momma always told me, "Life is like a box of new car dealers..."

<p>Subject: DEAR DUMBASS

<p>I'M A TWENTY YEAR OLD FINANCE MANAGER IN A SMALL DEALERSHIP IN SOUTH CAROLINA, IT'S PEOPLE LIKE YOU THAT COST ME MONEY, AND HEADACHES WITH YOUR STUPID INTERNET SITES THAT JUST CONFUSE PEOPLE.................

<p>(BLAH, I cut him off, it drags on too long -Jeff).

<p>.........P.S. I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR SOME OF YOUR IDEAS AND QUESTIONS JUST DON'T TAKE AWAY OUR SOURCE OF INCOME, BECAUSE WE ARE ALWAYS ONE STEP AHEAD OF YOU WHEN YOU FIGURE OUT 1 SECRET WE HAVE ALREADY CAME UP WITH 3 MORE...LOL

<p>How are you doin Jeff?

<p>I am just writing to let you know that I am an Internet Manager in the #1 Chevy dealer in Nassau County (NY). I think that sites like this are great. It gives the consumer info and definitely helps them form getting hurt. I just want to let the people know that not all of us are bad. I am in this business to make a living and put food on the table. I work very hard and I EXPECT to make money from it. Of course it has to be legit. I feel that the car business does have a bad rap, but I am working on it on my end. Just a message to the folks reading: It isn't necessarily a bad thing for a dealer to make money. Be fair and they will be fair towards you (most of us). Don't expect something for nothing though. There has to be some profit. Just do some homework and you'll be fine. Buying a warranty isn't a bad thing either. It's just like insurance. Over paying for a warranty is bad though. Like I said, do some homework and you will be ok. Thank you ! for reading. - Adam

<p>your article is offensive and absolute bull****! i have been in this business for a long time and have come across many people  like you who couldn't hack it in the auto industry and wind up trying to "expose" dealers as rip off artists our profit margins are low and have been for  the past couple of years. what are you selling? what is your profit margin why dont you attack the furniture or clothing business there profit margins can be  any where from 2 to 500%. better yet why don't you go f*** yourself!

<p>Subject: CarBuyingTips.com Question

<p>Jeff, I visited your sight for the first time today and found it very interesting. I am the General Sales Mgr. for a multi-franchise dealer in North-Eastern PA. I think your sight is very helpful to customers and we welcome all customers who bring in internet research with open arms. This is 2003 and people want to shop with  convenience and accuracy. These people who give you a hard time must be "old school" salespeople. My message to them is to try selling from the heart, be  genuine with your customers, and under promise and over deliver. If you can't truly do this, GET OUT OF THE BUSINESS! It's not people like Jeff that give us a  bad name, it's people like you. Shawn Hunter GSM R & R AUTO GROUP SCHUYLKILL HAVEN, PA.

<p>While most car salespeople are good honest people, some live by this principle: It is morally wrong to allow suckers to keep their money.
