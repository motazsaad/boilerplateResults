<h>Longitudinal Survey (PDF 200K)

<p>The Youth Media Campaign Longitudinal Survey (YMCLS) is an annual  national telephone survey of young people, ages 9 to 13 years, and their  parents. Working with research corporation Westat, CDC designed the YMCLS to  measure the physical activity-related beliefs, attitudes and behaviors of youth  and their parents and to monitor youth exposure to the VERB campaign. Survey  results guide the campaign's evolution and provide important information about  the impact of the VERB campaign.

<p>A Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing  technique was used to administer the survey. The appearance and structure of the  survey reflects the software that is used for survey delivery. The interviewer  reads all of the text — questions and response options — except for those in all  capital letters. Words or phrases that are in all capital letters are  automatically displayed to the interviewer and indicate possible coding options.  Text in parentheses at the end of a response category indicates a skip pattern  (e.g., GO TO S2).

<p>We administered the first YMCLS (YMCLS 2002) during spring  2002 before the launch of the national VERB campaign, to provide the baseline  for future studies. The baseline YMCLS 2002 was administered to more than 3,000  9-13 year olds and their parents nationally.

<p>Continuous Tracking Survey (PDF 265K).

<p>The Continuous Tracking Survey is an ongoing survey that collects data from a  sample of 9-13 year olds to better understand their impressions of the campaign  and its messages. The survey provides campaign planners and brand strategists  with information about how widely the campaign is being seen and how it is being  understood. The appearance and format of the survey reflects the interview  structure that is used.
