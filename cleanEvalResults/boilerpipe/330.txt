<p>How common is DHF?  

<p>As many as 33% of patients with obvious heart failure and a normal EF may have DHF. Risk of DHF increases with age:

<p>15% in patients under 60 years

<p>35% in patients 60 to 70 years

<p>50% in patients over 70 years old

<p>Mortality  

<p>Prognosis of patients with DHF is better than for SHF. Annual mortality for DHF is about 5 to 8%, while it is about 10 to 15% for SHF. In healthy people of the same age, mortality is about 1%. In DHF patients, prognosis is also affected by cause. When CAD is not the cause, annual mortality is much better, at about 2% to 3%. Age also affects risk of death. The 5-year mortality rate in DHF patients is:

<p>25% in patients under 60 years old

<p>35% in patients 60 to 70 years

<p>50% in patients over 70 years old

<p>Complications  

<p>The complication rate is about the same as for SHF patients. DHF causes frequent outpatient visits and hospital admissions. The one year readmission rate is almost 50% in DHF patients.

<p>Treatment             

<p>Treatment guidelines for systolic heart failure are based on large, properly done trials. Unfortunately, no such trials exist for DHF. So guidelines come from small trials, a doctor's experience, and his understanding of the disease. The general approach to treating DHF has 3 main steps:

<p>Treatment should reduce symptoms, mainly by lowering pulmonary pressure. Ways to reduce pressure include reducing heart size, maintaining good pumping in the heart's upper chambers, and slowing the heart rate.

<p>Treatment should target the underlying cause if possible. For example, high blood pressure should be controlled, remodeling should be reversed, the aortic valve replaced if necessary, and ischemia treated by increasing blood flow to the heart and reducing its need for oxygen

<p>Treatment should target the bodily systems changed by the disease, mainly neurohormonal systems

<p>Drug Therapy - General Principles  

<p>With some exceptions, many of the drugs used to treat systolic heart pressure are also used to treat diastolic heart failure. However, the reason they are used and the dose may be different for DHF.

<p>     For example, in DHF beta-blockers are used to make filling the heart with blood take longer, and to change the heart's response to exercise. In SHF, beta-blockers are used to increase pumping power and reverse heart remodeling. Diuretic dose for DHF is usually much smaller than for SHF. Calcium channel blockers have no place in SHF treatment but may help DHF.

<p>     The first step in treating DHF patients is to reduce lung congestion. You do that by lowering pulmonary (lung) pressure. This has 3 steps:

<p>Reduce heart size

<p>At first, heart size can be reduced by restricting fluid and sodium intake, by dialysis or filtering the blood, plasmapheresis , and diuretics. Relaxing (dilating) the blood vessels using nitro or morphine is effective but should be started at low doses to avoid low blood pressure. Low blood pressure can be a real problem in DHF patients. Long-term treatment should include small to moderate diuretic doses, mild doses of long-acting nitro, and restricted sodium intake . Aldactone (spironolactone) may be effective long-term because it suppresses the RAS . ACE inhibitors and ARBs reduce fluid retention and oxygen demand.

<p> 

<p>Make the heart's chambers beat together as a team

<p>The second step in lowering pulmonary pressure is to keep the heart's upper chambers (atriums) beating properly. Atrial fibrillation is poorly tolerated in DHF patients because it increases diastolic pressures, causing lung congestion and low blood pressure.In patients with a-fib, restoring normal rhythm should be a priority. Patients who need a pacemaker should have atrial pacing as well as ventricular pacing.

<p> 

<p>Slowing the heart rate

<p>The third step in lowering pulmonary pressures is to slow the heart rate. This gives the heart more time to relax so it can fill with blood. Fast heart rate is poorly tolerated in DHF patients because rapid heart rate:

<p>increases the heart's oxygen demand and reduces blood flow to the heart, causing ischemia even without CAD

<p>prevents full relaxation of the heart muscle, which raises pressure and reduces the heart's flexibility

<p>shortens the heart's relaxation period, making it incomplete, which reduces the amount of blood pumped per beat

<p>For these reasons, most doctors use beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers to slow the heart rate a lot in DHF patients. However, slowing the heart rate too much can reduce cardiac output despite better filling. This is why DHF patients need very individualized treatment. An initial goal might be a resting heart rate of about 60 beats per minute.

<p>     Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers increase the time it takes the heart to fill with blood. This helps keep pulmonary pressures low. However, these drugs also directly reduce the heart's ability to relax by their effects at the cell level. It's a tricky balance to strike in DHF patients. The overall effect of these drugs in DHF patients is improved symptoms.

<p>     The long-term effect of calcium channel blockers on diastolic heart failure patients is unknown. All calcium channel blockers except amlodipine increase mortality in patients with systolic heart failure.

<p>  Nebivolol Helps CHF Seniors with Normal EF

<p>March 27, 2006 - A "third generation" (new) beta-blocker called Nebivolol is on the way. Nebivolol has the main good benefit of Toprol-XL (beta-1 blocking without beta-2 blocking) plus one of the good benefits of Coreg (relaxing the arteries, called vasodilation). It also helps endothelial function and is a powerful anti-oxidant. Nebivolol does this without all of Coreg's side effects.

<p>     Researchers studied how nebivolol affects systolic versus diastolic left heart function in patients. This substudy included 104 patients; 43 had an EF less than 36%. Echo was done on each patient to take quite a few heart measures at study start and again one year later.

<p>     In the group with EF less than 36%, nebivolol reduced heart size and improved EF 5%. Other measures remained the same. In patients with EF higher than 36%, no changes in the heart muscle were seen.

<p>     So in patients with weakly pumping hearts (low EF), nebivolol reduces heart size and improves EF. In patients with near-normal or normal EF (diastolic heart failure) no changes in the heart muscle were seen. None the less, risk of death or heart-related hospitalization improved in both groups in SENIORS.

<p>     The SENIORS trial showed that nebivolol reduces risk of death and heart-related hospitalizations in senior CHFers regardless of EF. What does this mean? It suggests that CHFers with diastolic heart failure may now have a drug proven to help them.

<p>     Jon's note : The average age in the SENIORS trial was 76 years.

<p>Drugs and Exercise Tolerance  

<p>Exercise in a healthy person makes the heart relax more quickly and lowers LV pressure faster. The heart muscle actually stretches and gets larger when full of blood just before pumping it out. This increases EF . In a healthy person, these actions help the body handle exercise.

<p>     In DHF, those actions are very limited. The heart's stiffness prevents it from stretching to increase its size when filled with blood. EF does not rise, and patients get short of breath and very tired. Often, there is quite a rise in blood pressure and heart rate during exercise. The rise in blood pressure makes the heart work harder, which screws up the entire pumping cycle.

<p>     These changes increase diastolic pressures. High diastolic pressures reduce lung function and make breathing harder. Low heart output during exercise causes fatigue in the legs and other muscles.

<p>     Small trials show that calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and ARBs improve exercise ability in many DHF patients. However, these drugs do not always improve heart function.

<p>Inotropes  

<p>Use inotropic drugs with caution. Since ejection fraction is often okay in DHF patients, inotropes may give no benefit at all. However, such drugs can cause harm in these patients. Inotropic drugs may help in the short-term for lung congestion but even short-term use may cause ischemia , speed up heart rate, or trigger arrhythmias.

<p>Digoxin (Lanoxin, digitalis)  

<p>Digoxin (Lanoxin) strengthens the heart's pumping power. This increases energy demand, which may only show up during stress like exercise or ischemia, when digoxin can worsen diastolic function. With the exception of patients in chronic atrial fibrillation (to slow ventricular rate), digoxin is not recommended for DHF.

<p>Coronary Artery Disease  

<p>In CAD , treatment should aim to reduce the heart's oxygen demand and increase blood flow to the heart. Drugs like nitrates (nitroglycerine), calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers have all been shown to help. Clearing blocked arteries with angioplasty or CABG may also help diastolic heart failure patients with CAD.
