With your help, we have been instrumental in providing       assistance to hundreds of individuals and many groups and organizations.       Over the last ten years more than 2 million dollars has been granted               for equipment... but the need continues and we need your               help!

<p>Donate to the ANNUAL CAMPAIGN

<p>Each year we ask our loyal donors to assist us with their continued support by    making an annual contribution.  With ongoing funding we are able to make a     difference in the life of a person with a disability like Richard…

<p>Hi!    My  name is Richard. You've never met me, but I'm one of the many    people  helped by the Children's Ability Fund. I am writing because    I want to help this very special organization raise more                                 money    this year                than ever before.

<p>When I was just one year old, I had a stroke. This left me with a brain injury and     in a wheelchair. I cannot speak much at all - but I have so much to say! For 9 years     I used a Touch Talker to help me communicate with my family and friends. After awhile    it kept breaking down. I was so good at typing it couldn't keep up to me!

<p>When I started high school.                I was so nervous. I was going to be meeting new friends and wanted      to make sure I could talk to them so they could get to know me.

<p>That's when I wrote to the Children's Ability Fund and asked them to help buy a new talking device. The one that I really liked was called the Delta Talker. I knew it would help me learn, meet new friends and become more independent.

<p>Now so many great things have happened! I have my new talking                device and have met many new friends at my school. I really enjoy                visiting with them and I like to answer questions in class. My teachers                say I am a good student, especially in science and math. This could                not have happened without help from the Children's Ability Fund.

<p>They have helped so many people like me. Now, I want others to feel as great as I do. Please help them help others. Make a donation today. Your donation will make  a big difference to others - just like it did for me.

<p>Thank you for reading my letter. Maybe someday I can show you my new talker.

<p>Add to the Bursary Fund

<p>Some friends of the Children's Ability Fund chose to make a donation                specifically to assist students with a disability. The Bursary Fund                was established to ensure a continued commitment to providing an                annual bursary to students in need through the               Children's Ability Fund Bursary.

<p>Contribute to the Endowment Fund

<p>In 1987, the Endowment Fund was established to ensure the continuity and longevity of the       organization and its goals and to ensure that the resources would be available to meet the       growing demand our economy has placed on non-profit organizations to provide funding for       the necessary equipment to people with disabilities.

<p>Our target is $5,000,000 and we are happy to report that we have               reached the half way mark.

<p>Donations made directly through the Endowment Fund and received through      the Planned Giving Program are invested and the resources      are used to ensure the long-term financial stability of the Children's      Ability Fund.

<p>Donate a Gift in Kind
