<h>"The 2005 'Researchers in Europe' Initiative"

<p>How to apply?

<p>The Researchers in Europe Initiative 2005 is a broad awareness raising campaign aimed at improving the knowledge by the public at large of the role and impact of the work of researchers in society, and to increase the number of researchers in Europe by fostering public support for the researchers' profession and attracting more young people into research careers.

<p>The deadline for reception of proposals under this action was: 2 December 2004 at 17.00 (Brussels local time)

<p>What kind of projects can be funded ?

<p>All projects aimed at raising the public understanding of the role of researchers in society, for example: the organisation of awareness-raising events on the researchers' work and profession in the framework of e.g. science weeks and festivals, debates, forums, 'scientific cafés', exhibitions in schools and science museums, encounters between scientists and the public, competitions, Web contests, press-related activities. Unlike other Marie Curie actions, this specific call is not aimed at financing research training, projects or conferences. It should also be underlined that the awareness-raising events do not need to address primarily the members of the scientific community as such, but rather the public at large.
