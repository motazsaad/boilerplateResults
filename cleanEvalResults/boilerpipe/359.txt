<p> Twisting Truth   through Classroom Consensus

<p> Using the Bible to promote inter-faith "dialogue" and "common ground"

<p>"The Bible and Public Schools: A First Amendment     Guide was prepared by the Freedom Forum 's First Amendment Center [1] and the National Bible     Association . It encourages schools to offer courses in the Bible as literature....  The guidebook says supernatural happenings and divine actions     described in the Bible may not be taught as historical fact. And it says students     should be exposed to a variety of religious and secular Biblical   interpretations."  [Diverse     Groups Endorse Bible Study Guide for Schools]

<p>"Critical to any teaching about religion in the public schools     should be inclusion and respect for a full range of religious and nonreligious voices,     and a recognition of religious pluralism as a source of strength for American     society...." [2]   The     American Assembly

<p>"This is an historic day when we     can announce a broad consensus on teaching about the Bible in our public schools....     We have found common ground for common good." Chuck Stetson, vice chairman of     the National Bible Association. [3]

<p>"Bill   Clinton will be a great president… if he can make America the creator of a new world   order based on consensus.” [4]   Mikhail Gorbachev

<p>Its   influential "friends" may threaten the Church far more than   its obvious enemies. One such dubious ally, the nice-sounding Freedom   Forum , has won the support of many Christian leaders by joining their quest for "religious freedom" in public schools. Few seem to realize that the cost of this   questionable partnership is the purity of God's Word. Remember, the Bible's message ceases   to be God's uncompromising Truth when slashed by inter-faith criticism, judged by group consensus, and   molded to fit politically correct standards.  

<p>Yet,   Christians across the country praise this revival. With their approval, a compromised   view of the Bible blends with other sacred writings and religious messages in the classroom. By a   strange consensus, these religions are being   adapted to fit a new   interpretation of the First Amendment -- one that twists its promised freedom into pretext and   control. Thus, schoolchildren learn "about the Bible" through a pre-planned group   process which twists God's truths into the evolving ideals of the planned global spirituality.   (See Mind Control )

<p>Leading   this movement is Charles Haynes , former director of the First Liberty Institute and "senior scholar   for religious freedom" at the Freedom Forum. He serves on the Board of Directors of   the Character Education Partnership (see Character Training For Global Citizenship ) and edited the acclaimed book, Finding   Common Ground: A First Amendment Guide to Religion and Public Education .

<p> 

<p>Note: The updated version of Finding Common      Ground is recommended at www.pastors.com , Rick Warren's website      for pastors around the world.

<p>Back in 1999, Mr. Haynes' helped write "The   Bible and Public Schools," an interfaith Guide for teaching Bible in public schools .   It was endorsed by unlikely partners such as:

<p>The       National Council of Churches and the National Association of Evangelicals

<p>The       liberal National Education Association (NEA) and the Christian   Educators Association

<p>The Council on Islamic Education and the National Association of Evangelicals

<p>People       for the American Way (PAW) and the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs

<p>The       National School Boards Association and the Christian Legal Society

<p>The       Anti-Defamation League and the Christian Coalition [ i ,  ii ,  iii ]

<p>These strange   alliances alone should raise questions about Charles Haynes' First Amendment   Guide.  So should   his membership on The Pluralism Project 's Advisory Board ,   which includes Wiccan author Margot Adler and Professor Diana Eck, an authority on   Hinduism who chairs Harvard’s Committee on the Study of Religion. 

<p>"Pluralism is an achievement.... It requires relationship, it requires engagement around             a common  table, so to speak, of             our civic society."    Dr.               Diana Eck , whose Pluralism Project CD, "On Common Ground:  World Religions in America," won praise from Charles Haynes.

<p>But there is a bigger reason for concern.    Mr. Haynes program plays a vital part in a worldwide movement that demands religious compromise, a   pre-planned consensus, and   a global ethic which turns God's values upside-down. Take a look at the global context   for his view of freedom:  

<p>Promote   the   UN vision for global solidarity.

<p>For more than half a century, UNESCO has pursued the goal of its first   Secretary-General, Julian Huxley -- an avowed Socialist leader like his brother Aldous.  Now as then, the UN agency in charge of education, science and culture has shown little tolerance   for those who refuse to bend to its goals:

<p>"The mission of UNESCO... is that of advancing... international     peace and the common welfare... We have witnessed... the resurgence     of nationalism, the growth of fundamentalism and of religious and ethnic intolerance. The roots of exclusion and hatred have     shown themselves even deeper and more tenacious than we had feared...     Peace... requires, in the words of the Constitution, 'the intellectual     and moral solidarity of mankind'." [5] (emphasis and link added)

<p>To   achieve solidarity, UNESCO must win public consent for mind-changing psycho-social strategies that   would mold and monitor the way people think everywhere. To win this consent, it needs a public crisis --   one that's either real, exaggerated or merely an illusion. Reality matters far less than   public perception. 

<p>The crisis summarized in the   UNESCO mission fits the   need. With help from the media, it has already persuaded people around the world that "the resurgence of nationalism, the growth of   fundamentalisms and of religious... intolerance" is a "global threat." This   perception can now be used to conform, not only nations and "fundamental" Christians to the UN vision, but also the Bible itself.  

<p>Christians   who love God's Word know that His family is made up of people from "every   tribe and nation." In Christ, people from every race and culture become one. Yet, Biblical Christianity is considered too narrow and divisive for the globalist leaders who have been   planning the new solidarity since 1945. Notice the blatant intolerance toward Biblical   truth and other "certainties" in this 1946 statement by Dr. Brock Chisholm,   first head of the World Health Organization:

<p>"We have swallowed all manner of poisonous     certainties fed us by our parents.... The results are frustration, inferiority,     neurosis and inability to... make the world fit to live in....

<p>"It has long been generally accepted that     parents have a perfect right to impose any points of view, any lies or fears,     superstitions, prejudices, hates, or faith on their defenseless children.... [People with] guilts, fears, inferiorities, are certain to project their hates     on to others.... Such reaction now becomes a dangerous threat to the whole     world...." [6]

<p>God's   absolute, unchanging truth simply doesn't fit the new ideology. His absolute truth offends those who pursue contrary   beliefs and lifestyles. It seems "intolerant" and "hateful" to   those who seek public approval for their own ways. Charles Haynes   summarizes this view well:

<p>“Bitter     culture wars over abortion, homosexuality and other social issues are acerbating (sic)     our     religious differences. Exploding diversity is changing the face of our nation,     unleashing fear, intolerance and hatred in the process. And many Americans are fast     retreating into their own cultural and ethnic ‘tribes.’" [" 21st-century   America must build ties, not rifts "]

<p>Our   leaders have a new word for this crisis: separatism. During a 1991 speech at a Communitarian Conference in Washington D.C.,   Al Gore said, "Seeing ourselves as separate is the central problem in our political   thinking." (See Clinton's War on Hate Bans Christian Values)

<p>The   opposite of Mr. Gore's separatism is the other "s" word: solidarity. To   understand its ominous meaning,   come with me to Habitat II , the 1996 UN Conference on Human Settlements. It included a day-long mini-conference   on "Solidarity" held at an elegant Turkish palace in Istanbul. Here, a   panel of global leaders moderated by Robert McNeil (of McNeil and Lehrer), outlined the   UN agenda for religious unity and social control. I taped and transcribed their   comments. Compare some of   their remarks (in boxes) with the comments by Charles Haynes and others who have   joined his crusade.

<p>Use   spiritual   unity to build the global community  

<p> “I           have gathered leaders with tremendous wisdom and prestige. They are bringing the           spiritual dimension—the only ingredient that can bind societies           together.” Conference Secretary-General Wally N’Dow, Solidarity     panel

<p>“What’s     needed is an interfaith center in every city of the globe. The new     interfaith centers will honor the rituals of every… faith tradition…     and provide opportunity for sacred expressions needed to bind the     people of the planet into a viable, meaningful, and sustainable     solidarity.” James Morton, Cathedral of St. John the Divine and     Temple of Understanding, Solidarity panel

<p>The Temple   of Understanding , housed in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, serves as a meeting place   for various occult, inter-faith, and UN groups. Here international policy-makers have planned   their steps for establishing the global spirituality needed as an ethical foundation for the   envisioned global community. The Temple helped establish the Parliament of World Religions as well as Gorbachev’s International Green Cross.  According to its   Winter 1993 Newsletter, 

<p>“The purpose of the Temple of     Understanding is the worldwide promotion of interfaith dialogue and education,     to achieve understanding and harmony among the people of the world’s religions and     beyond. … We invite your active participation and support.”  (emphasis added)

<p>A 1991 Temple Newsletter shows the inter-faith/occult institution's   agreement with- and support for Charles Haynes and his Bible curriculum. Considering   that liberal media leader Henry Luce III, who signed the Williamsburg   Charter , was also a Temple board member, the broad associations should be no   surprise:

<p>“The Temple of Understanding     is collaborating with three other international interfaith organizations to form the     International Interfaith Organizations Coordinating committee, which has been meeting     to develop plans to celebrate 1993 as 'A Year of Inter-religious Understanding and     Co-Operation' by sponsoring a centennial celebration in Bangalore of the 1893 World     Parliament of Religions…..

<p>“Hartley     Films Offered Free to the Public Schools.  Elda     Hartley, who began in 1965 to produce films on all the world’s great spiritual     traditions [except Christianity], has made her award-winning films on Eastern     religions available through the Temple of Understanding to school libraries     throughout the United States.

<p>[Statement by Elda Hartley:] “We     all wonder what we can do to promote global understanding. One way is to spread     understanding of other people’s beliefs, and here at the Temple of Understanding we     think that the best place to start is with young people in their formative years.

<p>"We are encouraged by the fact that     teaching ‘about’ religion in the schools is receiving official approval in a     growing number of states. ...  five states in the U.S. have offered pilot programs with a religious-liberty     curriculum issued by First Liberty Institute, a coalition of educators and     religious groups formed in 1988....

<p>“Charles Haynes, director of     the institute has written that ‘Growing numbers of educators throughout the United     States recognize that study about religion in social studies, literature, art, and     music is an essential part of a complete public school education. States  and schools districts are issuing news mandates and guidelines for the     inclusion of teaching about religion in the curriculum....'" [7]  

<p>Redefine terms for a new social   contract 

<p>“Citizenship           for the next century is learning to live together. The           21st Century city will be a city of social solidarity.... We have to redefine           the words... [and write a new] social contract.” Federico Mayor,     former head of UNESCO

<p>In     his article, " 21st-century   America must build ties, not rifts ," Charles Haynes wrote, 

<p>“One     key deterrent to the ‘disuniting of America’ lies in reaffirming what it means to     be an American…. An ‘American’ is one who has an abiding commitment to the     democratic first principles….”

<p>Is   it? That's not what I learned when I became an American citizen. These "democratic first principles" are part of Mr. Haynes' definition of the First   Amendment. They represent a new way of looking at the Bill of Rights -- one that ties   the right to express one's faith to a responsibility    to participate in a manipulative group dialogue. (See Trading U.S. Rights for UN Rules )   This form of dialogue teaches each person to replace individual   thinking with collective thinking under the noble banner of "common good."  But his definitions include   other details.

<p>Finding Common Ground outlines the social contract for the   global village. It also illustrates   how its group of authors did "redefine the words" and introduce a new social   contract. Quoting from the Williamsburg Charter, which laid the foundation for The First Liberty   Institute headed by Dr. Haynes, it states,

<p>"The Compact Must be Mutual.   ...that rights are universal and     responsibilities mutual is both the premise and the promise of democratic     pluralism….. From this axiom… derives guidelines for conducting public debates     involving religion…."

<p>"First, those who claim the     right to dissent should assume the responsibility to debate:     Commitment to democratic pluralism assumes the coexistence with one political     community of groups whose ultimate faith commitments may be incompatible, yet whose     common commitment to social unity and diversity does justice to both the requirements     of individual conscience and the wider community. A general consent to the obligations     of citizenship is therefore inherent…." 

<p>"Second, those who claim the     right to criticize should assume the responsibility to comprehend….     Genuine tolerance honestly weights honest differences and promotes both impartiality     and pluralism. Debased tolerance results in indifference to the differences that     vitalize a pluralistic democracy…."

<p>"Third, those who claim the     right to influence should accept the responsibility not to inflame…." [8]

<p>The last statement     points to a basic, though unstated, ground rule for the consensus process: Don't offend     the diverse group members with politically incorrect expressions. Unpopular   facts or ideas clash with an essential part of the transformational process: building trusting relationships   that bridge the inter-faith and cross-cultural divisions. Naturally, it doesn't take long     before the group's     disapproval intimidates most dissenters into silence. Few Christians dare voice   contrary facts, values or     beliefs that might violate another person's comfort zone. That's   against the rules!

<p>Trade     individual thinking for collective thinking.

<p>“Change           your whole way of thinking, because the new           order of the spirit is confronting and challenging you.” Millard           Fuller, Habitat for Humanity

<p>In 1995, UNESCO's Commission on Culture and [human] Development   issued a  report titled, Our Creative Diversity. On page 11, it states   that...

<p>“The     challenge to humanity is to adopt new ways of thinking, new ways of acting, new     ways of organizing itself in society, in     short, new ways of living."

<p>The message behind these words is staggering. Everything   must be changed -- especially the way we think of ourselves in relationship to the "greater whole."   When applied to religion,   the "new ways of thinking" means setting aside "narrow" or   inflexible beliefs for the sake of unity and "common good."  Christianity   must either bend or break.  

<p>When students evaluate the Bible from this pluralistic   or collective point of view, they are forced to criticize their own beliefs and compromise all truths that   don't fit the new mental framework. Only   a cross-less, malleable, ever-changing form of Christianity would pass the test. 

<p>To   make sure high school students don't escape this mental training,     Charles Haynes calls for a conclusive course for high school seniors. In his article, " The   Relationship of Religion to Moral Education in the Public Schools, " co-authored by Professor Warren Nord (University of NC at Chapel Hill) and posted on the Communitarian Network ),     he said,    

<p>"We also believe, however, that there should be room in the     curriculum for a capstone course that high school seniors might take, in which     they learn about the most important frameworks of moral thought, secular and     religious, historical and contemporary, and how such frameworks might shape our     thinking about the most urgent moral problems we face.

<p>"...It is striking to us that most economics texts (quite properly)     include discussions of Marxism and socialism, but none that we have seen says anything     significant about religious ways of thinking about economics." [9]

<p>Guide     change in the "right" direction 

<p>“We           should stop bemoaning the growth of cities. It’s going to happen and it’s a           good thing, because cities are the vectors of social change and transformation. Let’s           just make sure that social change and transformation are going in the right           direction." Dr. Ismail Serageldin, Vice President of the World Bank

<p>"The right   direction" means shifting from the Christian worldview (or paradigm) to the Global   worldview. Some call it a paradigm   shift. Look at the three main paradigms (ways of thinking and   understanding reality) of the last fifty years. Notice that secular   humanism was only a brief transition stage. By the turn of the millennium, our culture   had generally embraced the global   paradigm. Religion   is once again acceptable -- as long as it reflects the new pluralism.
