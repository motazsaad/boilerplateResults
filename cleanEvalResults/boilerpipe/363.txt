<p>Outlining Process

<p>Please follow the very simple guidelines to ensure a good fit of all objects intended for your Custom Case.

<p>The only tools needed are a soft lead pencil, a ruler and typewriter paper.  If your handgun or knife are longer than an          8 1/2" X 11" standard paper, tape two sheets together and outline on both.

<p>Looking straignt down at the object, guide the pencil around the contours or profile as close to the actual size as possible.           We cannot stress the importance of the actual size drawing.  We will make the compartments slightly larger than the outline           to allow ease in removal of the handgun, knife or accessory.

<p>The interior velvet area is approx. 1 inch thick.  Give us the thickness dimensions of the depth of the objects           by writing them on their individual outlines (as shown).  Remember, objects that are thicker than 2 1/4 inches will not fit in           the basic case.  Larger items will require a deeper case, which will be slightly higher in price.

<p>The key is to Take Your Time with the outline process.  Have plenty of good lighting.  Make each ojects' outline as close          to ACTUAL SIZE as possible.  Remember to include the depth dimensions on each drawing. Send actual outlines to us in a LETTER.          Fax machines can enlarge or reduce important outlines without warning.  Please include your NAME, address and phone number on the back          of EACH outline and what objects they represent.
