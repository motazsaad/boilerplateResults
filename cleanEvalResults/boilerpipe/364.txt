<h>Baby Back Ribs - MeatHenge Style

<p>Posted by Biggles on October 27, 2003

<p>Well, it's been just over a week since MeatFest and I have a mid-week luncheon planned.  Maybe once a year or so I have some friends come over for a nice lungeon consisting mostly of ... well ... meat. It's good meat and this coming Thursday I plan on having several chickens roasting in a mesquite grill oven.

<p>I knew it was coming, and wasn't sure if I was up to the task.  So the first thing I did was buy a few racks of baby back ribs to hone my skills. They did just fine. I didn't get an after shot because they were so good I just stood over the cutting board and ate what I wanted.  Which was mostly all of them.  Oh well, what you gonna do?
