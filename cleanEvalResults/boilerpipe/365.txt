<p>Like many libertarians and their fellow-travelers, I use the word "prohibitionist" as a term of abuse, as in "Gun Prohibitionist," "Drug Prohibitionist," or "Alcohol Prohibitionist."  In each case, prohibition creates more problems than it solves.

<p>But where does one draw the line?  Would one sneer at an "H-bomb prohibitionist" for outlawing backyard H-bombs?

<p>As a draft, I offer the following--

<p>"Prohibitionist" --

<p>1.  (public impact) someone who would respond to a minority's misuse of a product or right by denying that product or right to the majority who use it responsibly.

<p>2.  (private impact) someone who would employ the coercive power of the government against private, non-criminal behavior.  (Behavior can be "criminal" only if it harms or unreasonably endangers another person without that person's informed consent.)
