<h>Does                      it matter who divorces whom?

<p>There are some disadvantages in                      being the one who is divorced. Firstly, you can be ordered                      to pay the legal fees for the divorce; this may seem (and                      often is) extremely unfair, a case of adding injury to insult.                      This is based on the old principle in the courts that if you                      prove your case then you get your costs, despite the fact                      that it is not always appropriate in the family justice system.                      However, if the practicalities of the actual divorce are agreed                      by both parties, it is also possible to agree that the two                      of you will share the legal fees between you, or indeed that                      the person who actually files the petition will not seek an                      order for costs against the spouse.

<p>Secondly, you may have the unpleasantness                      of being on the receiving end of some legal description of                      your private life, especially if the divorce is based on unreasonable                      behaviour. It is possible to file an Answer to the allegations                      and try to regain control of the process by forcing a compromise                      on the allegations made, but most prefer to avoid the legal                      complications and significant expense of doing so. Nevertheless,                      allegations made as to unreasonable behaviour do often stick                      in the gullet as the contents of the Petition rarely have                      much to do with why the marriage broke down.

<p>But who petitions against whom                      rarely spills over in to other more important areas, such                      as the children or finance. It is worth just checking that                      none of the allegations in the Petition relate to dealing                      with the children or to financial issues, since once the divorce                      is granted, those allegations become a finding of fact. Unless                      it is specifically agreed beforehand, these findings can be                      referred to in linked proceedings.

<p>The usual way of preventing such                      difficulties - and much acrimony too - is to offer the Petition                      in draft before it is sent to the court. Any items that cause                      particular upset can be discussed and either watered down                      or left out. This is not something that everyone has to do,                      but is very much in the spirit of the SFLA Code of Practice.

<p>An early discussion with an SFLA                      solicitor can help resolve some of these issues.

<p>Is                      there going to be a new law of divorce?

<p>The Family Law Act 1996 was passed                      in a fanfare, hailed as going some way towards removing acrimony                      in the divorce process by getting rid of the concept of 'fault'.                      However, the Government has since announced that those parts                      of the Act dealing with divorce will not now come into force.

<p>We are, unfortunately, left with                      the present system for the foreseeable future.

<p>Which                      court does it have to be in?

<p>If the divorce is going to take                      place in England and Wales, it is possible to get any County                      Court that is empowered to deal with divorce to issue proceedings.

<p>It is usual to use your local court                      for convenience's sake. Some use a court that is out of their                      area for fear of coming into contact with people they know                      in the local context (Mrs Simpson used Ipswich!). The Principal                      Registry in London is used by many who do not live there,                      for a mixture of all of these reasons or perhaps they believe                      that that court will handle their case better.

<p>Practices and judicial attitudes                      vary from court to court. Experienced solicitors with knowledge                      of the system sometimes choose a particular court for a particular                      case, to try and gain some advantage for their client.

<p>But for the vast majority of cases                      it is convenience that is the deciding factor - convenience                      for the solicitors particularly, since they will charge for                      their travel time to court. In any event courts have the power                      to order cases to be transferred to the court that is most                      appropriate - in the view of the judge rather than anyone                      else.

<p>Do                      children automatically live with their mother?

<p>Married parents share joint parental                      responsibility and come before the Court as equals. The children's                      welfare is the court's paramount consideration.

<p>If there is a dispute as to with                      which parent the children should live, one or other of them                      must issue an application for a Residence Order. In considering                      which parent is best able to meet the child's best interests,                      the Court will apply the "welfare checklist" (s1(3)                      Children Act 1989).

<p>The application of the Welfare                      Checklist points towards pragmatism:

<p>Who is best able to meet the                        child's day to day needs?

<p>What has the domestic routine                        been in the child's life to date?

<p>Even if there is little to choose between the two parents in terms of their actual parenting                        skills, are the work commitments of one more conducive to                        having primary care of the children? This last consideration                        is often fundamental and traditionally, has tended to work                        in favour of mothers, but increasingly, this need not necessarily                        be the case.

<p>Even where one parent does have                        a Residence Order in his or her favour, that does not alter                        the fact that the other parent retains parental responsibility                        and has an important role to play in the child's life. In                        theory at least, a Residence Order is not a passport to                        making important decisions about the child's upbringing                        on a unilateral basis.

<p>In the case of unmarried parents,                        the mother has sole parental responsibility until the father                        acquires it by way of an agreement, or Court Order. He will                        however be granted parental responsibility automatically                        if he has a Residence Order in his favour.

<p>In the case of very young children, it is a fact that                        courts tend to assume they are better off living with their                        mother unless clearly shown to the contrary. Nevertheless,                        there is no presumption of law and the courts have to consider                        each case on its individual merits. Although the odds may                        seem stacked against a father, the facts may mean that this                        is not necessarily the case.

<p>Is                      a 50/50 split the usual financial settlement?

<p>Recent cases concerning 'big money'                      - where the assets available for division clearly exceed the                      parties' needs - have focused on the concept of equality of                      outcome. This may or may not mean that the assets are divided                      50/50 in these cases. What it does mean is that contributions                      to the running of the home and the bringing up of children                      are valued equally by the court on divorce to contributions                      made by economically rewarding work. There may be other considerations                      - for example, the liquidity of the assets making up the family                      pot, or any inheritances received, or particularly bad financial                      conduct on one side, which dictate that the outcome should                      not be equal. Fairness is the key - and a 50/50 split will                      not be fair in all cases.

<p>Each case has to be looked at individually. It depends on                      the circumstances of those involved.

<p>In most cases, the financial settlement                      will reflect what each person needs fundamentally, money to                      pay all the bills and to sort out somewhere to live.

<p>Having an equal split is sometimes                      the starting point, but a lot of other factors have to be                      taken into account.

<p>See the section on FINANCE for more details. This explains how the law works.

<p>The great strength of the law is                      that it is flexible enough to treat each family differently.                      But that does make it difficult to work out what is right                      for you.

<p>We recommend that you consult a                      solicitor about your own case - to see what the likely outcomes                      might be.

<p>Should                      I close my joint account?

<p>Many couples do not make any changes                      to their banking arrangements until financial negotiations                      are well advanced.

<p>But if there is a risk that large                      sums may be drawn out - or if there is a risk that credit                      or charge cards may be used inappropriately - then it may                      be safer to take action to prevent this.

<p>The danger is that if an account                      or credit card is suddenly frozen, solicitors may be involved                      immediately to ask for maintenance arrangements to be set                      up - perhaps through the courts.

<p>Much depends on whether you can                      trust each other enough to leave things as they are.

<p>If you need to rearrange the accounts                      on separation we recommend that you try to agree those changes                      first. Think about mediation.

<p>If you have concerns about this                      area then consult a solicitor.
