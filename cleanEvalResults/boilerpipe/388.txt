<p>"The Fatty Acids Polyinsaturés: Essential for health ".

<p>...

<p>INFLUENCE PHYSICAL EXERCISE AND HYPOXIA ON BLOOD FLUIDITY:

<p>[ Blood thickness is inversely dependent upon the membrane rigidity of the blood cells, which is conversely dependent on the rigidity of double-layered lipidic of the membrane of the red globule. A rise in saturated fatty acid connections lowers the number of non-saturated double connections and contributes to cell rigidity.]

<p>[ Endurance exercises increases the rigidity of the red blood cells, providing an increase in the thickness of the blood. Hypoxia (lowered oxygen volume) of altitude reduces plasmic volume and induces a reduction in the thickness of the blood.]

<p>[ Increases in duration and intensity of exercise together with increases in altitude, increases saturated fatty acid presence and decreases polyunsaturated fatty acids -- acid arachidonic (omega-6), EPA and DHA (omega-3). This increases membrane saturation with the amount of omega-6 and omega-3 correlating with an increase in red blood cell membrane rigidity. (similar in influence to an increase in cholesterol presence) and reducing the blood capacity to absorb and retain oxygen.]

<p>[ During prolonged exercise, and at higher altitudes, blood cell changes produce reduced capillary efficiency, particularly in the lungs, liver, and spleen and reduced ability to carry and transfer oxygen to peripheral tissues. This induces an anaemia of iron deficiency by rupture of the red blood cells in the capillaries, under the effect of the rise in the cardiac flow and the blood pressure. ]

<p>INFLUENCE of FISH OIL ABSORPTION ON PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE

<p>...

<p>[ Supplementation of diet with fish oil (omega-3 = tuna, salmon, sardines, mackerel, lake trout, walnuts, pecans, almonds) suppresses the harmful blood fluidity changes encouraged by endurance exercises and high altitudes.]

<p>...

<p>[ Fish oils reduce capillary resistance to oxygen uptake and increase blood circulation to peripheral areas. The efficiency of oxygen transfer from blood to muscle cells is enhanced by a reduction in tissue rigidity and an increase in red blood cell presence at the capillaries.]

<p>[ At higher altitudes and during endurance exercises, fish oils increase the oxygen desaturation of the haemoglobin, and, increases the blood concentration of lactic acid ... the consequence of metabolism of glucose (stored energy in cellular sugars). Also, adrenalin receptors on the cellular surfaces are sensitised by the addition of omega-3 ( = tuna, salmon, sardines, mackerel, lake trout, walnuts, pecans, almonds) fish oils making glucose metabolism easier and faster.]

<p>PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES

<p>[ For altitudes over 2000 m and for high endurance activities, a supplementation of 250 g of omega-3 fish oils 3 to 5 times per week ( = tuna, salmon, sardines, mackerel, lake trout, walnuts, pecans, almonds) is beneficial. To avoid a vitamin E deficiency from arising from the exercise and the additional polyunsaturated fatty acids, a supplementation with vitamin E is required. These changes will provide for better performance.]

<p>COMMENT

<p>Release of mercury from cellular binding can be enhanced by remaining at an altitude of 1800 to 2000 metres (5,800 to 6,400 feet) for a period of not less than 1 week with an early daily fluctuation by travel down to 0 to 100 metres and return within 4 to 6 hours. The early fluctuations encourage greater permeability of the cell wall for the release of mercury and other toxins. Living at the reduced pressure altitude facilitates the release of these toxins from the cells.

<p>It can be fatal to not be aware of the hazards/cautions and to ignore their significance. Detoxing too quickly can induce severe symptoms, panic response, and acute depression. Pacing is imperative.

<p>HAZARDS / CAUTIONS

<p>The reduced air pressure fluctuation pattern and the moderate term higher altitude living arrangement is best NOT to be considered or acted upon UNLESS the individual either has accurate access to Spiritual Guidance and has been guided to take this action, OR, has been cleared by their physician who is aware of the potential health difficulties and challenges.

<p>IF your are aware that you have a low heart function (below 60% efficiency) and/or low lung function (below 60% efficiency), the likelihood of you experiencing altitude illness symptoms at the 1800 to 2000 metre (5,800 to 6,400 feet) level is HIGH.

<p>High cholesterol level and/or low blood pressure can be equally contributing factors to hypoxia and altitude sickness. It is imperative to remain self-directed and calm and take measures and supplements as indicated by Spiritual Guidance or accurate muscle testing if the symptoms are not to increase in severity due to panic.

<p>IF you are aware that you likely have residual mercury cellular loading, systemic or organ specific cellular contamination by fungi, bacterial, or FUIRERIA parasitic forms ... EXPECT that you will experience severe symptoms of their presence and release.

<p>Tobacco smoke, air pollution, certain toxic chemicals, some drugs and dry air (common at higher altitudes) all serve to decrease the healthy activity of the cilia of the respiratory tract and increase the likelihood of local viruses gaining entry further into the human body than would be possible with a less compromised lifesystem.

<p>Ensure that you have an adequate range and quantity of supplements for the detoxing of these contaminations from your blood and lymph, or, your health will be endangered to a severe or fatal level. Do NOT expect local physicians and health care workers to understand these dynamics or have constructive and effective ways of treating the symptoms beyond telling you to stay at lower altitudes.

<p>Supplements from which benefit are more often to be gained include:

<p>hawthorn extract (tincture) - heart;

<p>Hot cayenne in capsule (circulation);

<p>Coenzyme Q10 (heart and circulation);

<p>Maca herb in capsules (energy and stamina);

<p>Gingko Biloba (brain circulation);

<p>Quercetin bioflavanoid complex (anti-histaminic).

<p>Arnica tincture or arnica homeopathic tablets will benefit some individuals. As always, check with Spiritual Guidance or by muscle testing for personal relevancy. Some personality types will NOT benefit from some supplements; some blood types are disadvantaged by some supplements.

<p>Cinnamon has been demonstrated to reduce cholesterol influence with almost all persons.

<p>The use of passive aerobic exercise methods (i.e. The Chi Machine) will increase oxygen availability and transport or the cells. If living near or above 2000 m and experiencing periodic altitude sickness, the use of the Chi Machine can reduce the symptoms. This could also assist in reducing the symptoms of poor heart and/or lung efficiency, and/or arteriosclerosis at lower altitudes.

<p>A reduction of the oxygen starvation influence of mercury/lead poisoning, fungal and bacterial infections, worm and fluke infestations, and, viral attacks -- can also be reduced by the use of the Chi Machine. Alternatively, usage of the Chi Machine can be restricted by one's Identity elements, energy blocks, and structural integration.
