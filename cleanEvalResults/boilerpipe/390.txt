<h>Describe the difficulties of Luria's Z (The man with a shattered world)

<p>and how (to what extent) he overcame them.

<p>Luria's Z or Zazetsky was once a very clever student studying at a

<p>Polytechnic Institute in Russia; he was in his fourth year of study.

<p> However, unfortunately he suffered severe brain damage which destroyed

<p>his chance of a normal life. His brain damage was the cause of a

<p>bullet fragment shot into his brain during war. From then on Z

<p>suffered impairment of vision, loss of memory and ability to speak,

<p>read and write. The book `The man with the shattered world' describes

<p>how this courageous man relearns to identify, recall and understand the

<p>way to speak, read and write.

<p>Firstly, Z's ability to see was almost completely ruined. His vision

<p>worked in very mysterious ways. He could no longer see a whole single

<p>object. Instead, his eyes saw the left side of objects; the right side

<p>of things didn't seem to exist. For instance when he picked up a spoon

<p>he could only see part of it. His vision was not the same as yours or

<p>mine; it was completely different. To him the things others would see

<p>would just be a swarm of fuzziness. A picture appeared to be upside

<p>down, inside out, lop sided and any other way it could be distorted.

<p>If things did seem to be fuzzy, what he did see was only half as much

<p>as someone else would see; he had a small span of vision.

<p>Not only were real situations muffled by his vision but so were

<p>imaginary situations. Z suffered hallucinations because the damaged

<p>area of the brain stimulated the nerve cells that retain visual

<p>memories. It was as though the right side of his body didn't exist.

<p> He couldn't see it so every time he walked along he bumped into walls

<p>as a result. Vision was just one of the many difficulties Z suffered.

<p>Due to the brain damage his `sense of body' changed as well as his

<p>reactions. In fact, he had no sense of his body including other objects

<p>around him. He loses the sight of his right side because he forgets he

<p>can't see that side; this is because of t At other times Z was unaware

<p>of the positioning of his body's parts.

<p> If he closed his eyes he wasn't quite sure where his right leg was.

<p> He had to search for parts of his body like separate pieces.

<p>Surprisingly it was very difficult to show his doctor where his back

<p>was. In addition he'd forgotten a lot of the names for parts of his

<p>body; it would take him literally hours to remember. It was impossible

<p>for Z to point out something quickly because he got all confused. For

<p>example if the doctor said `Hands on your hips', he would be left all

<p>bewildered.

<p>Another misfortune was forgetting how his body functioned like going to

<p>the toilet and forgetting how to get someone's attention. The time

<p>when he needed the toilet in hospital was frustrating for Z because

<p>he'd forgotten how to get the nurse's attention. The physical strains

<p>were just too much for him as he got tired very easily and quickly.

<p>Sense of space was another difficulty Z faced. Generally, he had no

<p>sense of it and couldn't judge relationships between things. He

<p>perceived the world as broken into thousands of separate parts.

<p>Misjudging the position of objects was one of his faults. For example

<p>if he wanted to sit down he would misjudge whereabouts the chair was

<p>and where he was. The same difficulty occurred with clasping hands;

<p>he couldn't use his right hand because he couldn't see it. This seemed

<p>to be a situation of `out of sight out of mind'.

<p>Difficulties such as these ran into those using objects. Z forgot how

<p>to use simple things. If he was given a needle and thread in hospital

<p>workshops he would just sit there for ages to workout how to use them.

<p>They looked familiar but he just forgot how to use them. More

<p>misjudgments of the position of objects lead to problems. For example

<p>when he went to axe a stump of wood he would just hit the floor or his

<p>foot instead. Things seemed so peculiar to him that he was afraid to

<p>reach out and touch things in his room.

<p> He lived in a world that seemed to have disintegrated; the simplest

<p>things became so complex. Z had to search for everything as Luria

<p>describes,'he mentally probed each object as though he were a blindfolded

<p>man groping his way through space'. It was just one big maze for him

<p>because because he couldn't orient himself in space, tell from left or

<p>right or gauge distance and relationship between 2 objects. Z couldn't

<p>even workout where a sound was coming from because he'd lost spatial

<p>orientation.

<p>His ability to read also suffered great problems. It would take him

<p>hours to read something let alone understand it. Once, his family

<p>bought a new stove; he spent weeks trying to read and understand the

<p>instruction booklet that eventually he was convinced the stove was

<p>faulty. His concentration to read was too hard so he avoided it when

<p>he could. Generally, he couldn't read; he was illiterate and couldn't

<p>remember the alphabet. However, he attempted to relearn this skill.

<p>By the third lesson he could remember the letters m and a but not

<p>immediately; he progressed very slowly. He especially found it very

<p>difficult to remember the letters s, k and m. So, he tried to

<p>associate words with them but he could only remember these for a couple

<p>of minutes. For him to remember words, he found it good to recite the

<p>out loud. b Reading was very difficult for Z. It wasn't until a few

<p>months that he knew the whole alphabet; even still he couldn't recall

<p>it immediately. His visual span was limited so his reading suffered

<p>subsequently. Z couldn't see an entire word, he had to read each

<p>letter. In order to read he would have to focus a little to the right

<p>and above a letter to see it. He could only read three letters at

<p>a time. Reading was so slow for him ; when he got to the third word of

<p>a sentence he had forgotten the words before so he'd start again. As a

<p>result, he read really slowly and became very irritated plus the fact

<p>that he couldn't read out of his right eye.

<p>Reading was just part of Z's problem with letters and words. To find

<p>out he could no longer write was also devastating seeing as he used

<p>this all the time in his studies. For one the simple task of actually

<p>holding a pencil was almost impossible. He literally forgotten how to

<p>do this and write letters. Even if he did manage to write something he

<p>wasn't in any fit state to read what he'd written.

<p> The progress of his writing was the same as his progress to read, that

<p>being slow. It took him six months to read and write with intensive

<p>practice. Z missed out a lot of the important details out when he

<p>wrote. Punctuation wasn't present in his writing as he'd forgotten any

<p>kin of rule. Grammar was another impossible obstacle to get over. The

<p>injury his brain was left with was couldn't allow him to operate with

<p>language. Too complex syntactical patterns are far too difficult for a

<p>patient to grasp who can't even grasp the interrelationships of words

<p>and workout what they imply. For instance, Z may understand what

<p>`brother' and `father' mean but wouldn't be able to know what

<p>`brother's father' meant. He was only able to understand very short

<p>sentences.

<p>Writing was such a long painful process. He spent twenty five years

<p>writing his journal. It would literally take one day to write half or

<p>one full page. This was because he didn't know how to write. He

<p>didn't know how to link one sentence with another and so consequently

<p>wrote disjointed phrases and clauses. His lack of memory affected his

<p>ability to write. It would take him ages to to remember words; every

<p>word was on the tip of his tongue. The subject he was actually writing

<p>about also slipped from his memory. As a result he often repeated what

<p>he'd written because he'd forgotten he'd already written it. Soon, he

<p>no longer had the strength, memory, thoughts or ideas to carry on

<p>writing his life story. In fact, writing took longer and longer towards

<p>the end of his journal.

<p>All of these difficulties Z suffered from were due to major loss of

<p>memory. In the beginning, just after being wounded, he couldn't even

<p>remember his own name and the village that he lived in. Names would be

<p>lingering in his mind ready to be spoken, on the tip of his tongue.

<p>If he actually tried to to remember things he would find it extremely

<p>difficult to find the right words. But when he didn't happen to be

<p>thinking of it he suddenly found words coming to him. For example,

<p>familiar tunes would suddenly appear in his head. Even so, his memory

<p>was still very bad. It was also shattered into small pieces like the

<p>rest of his world.

<p>As Z's memory was so bad, this prevented him from ever studying

<p>anything he'd once learnt as a student. His memory even affected him

<p>in every day situations. It was a constant strain for him to think and

<p>remember the words people spoke and answer back at the same time. He

<p>was constantly forgetting. Every day simple chores would be delayed as

<p>a result of his memory. For instance, he would go to the barn for some

<p>coal and forget the key; but as soon as he went back for it he'd forget

<p>why he was there. His main trouble was amnesia and forgetfulness.

<p>Even though his memory was seriously impaired there were some things he

<p>could remember more than others. He found it far easier to remember

<p>things from far back in the past like his Kindergarten building. The

<p>funny thing was he had trouble remembering the recent past. As he

<p>stated ,'my memories came back from the wrong end'. Instead of recent

<p>situations being easily remember Z could recollect childhood memories

<p>with a vivid imagination. Whereas simple common memories such as

<p>remembering what a cat or dog looked like was very hard for Z. He

<p>couldn't even visualise faces from his own family but he immediately

<p>recognised them.

<p>Generally, Z's previous effort to acquire useful knowledge had been

<p>pointless. Everything he'd learnt at school had gone. Languages he'd

<p>learnt at school like German and English had been forgotten. As well

<p>as using foreign languages his use of arithmetic had also gone.

<p>Unfortunately, Z had forgotten how to count. He was unable to count

<p>back change given to him in a shop. All those everyday things that you

<p>or I find simple, he finds complex. He has to look life very simply in

<p>a way that a young child would.

<p>Even though Z has tried for years to improve himself, in reality his

<p>wound has caused major brain damage. Damaged areas of the cerebral

<p>cortex could not be restored. Improvements haven't really been made

<p>although he has adjusted to his body peculiarities but they still annoy

<p>him if he's suffering an attack. However, problems with `space'

<p>continued for years. He was unable to orient himself in his own home

<p>settlement.

<p>When it came to reading and writing, he did actually teach himself how

<p>to do these skills again. However, it took a very long time. As you

<p>know it took him 25 years to write his journal at one page a day at the

<p>most. The content of his writing didn't really improve as his effort

<p>to express himself became no simpler. Although, his speaking improved.

<p>But his world continued to be alien and fragmented. Nothing altered

<p>his tragic state of memory. So to a certain extent Z never really

<p>overcame his trouble of memory. Instead he just constantly tried to

<p>improve things. In reality he was faced with a vicious circle of life

<p>which had no real end.
