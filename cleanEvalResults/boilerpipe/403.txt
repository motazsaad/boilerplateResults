<p>5a. Audio Review: Will Wright – Simulation                  Design

<p>At Epic we have all been excited recently by the                  potential of audio files and iPods as learning devices. Thus when                  I came across an audio file by Will Wright on www.itconversations.com I downloaded it to my iPod and began listening. Will Wright, for                  those that don’t know, was the founder of Maxis, the company                  that created the world’s best selling PC game The Sims.                  This is a game that my daughter spends many hours playing and                  hence I was also interested to understand the way the game was                  designed.

<p>Will is also a very amusing speaker and interesting                  individual. He explained that when he gets a new game the first                  thing he does is work out what you have to do and then do the                  complete opposite i.e. drive the wrong way on a racing game. He                  also likes his children to experiment in the same way and added “do you know that Barbie’s hair is flammable?” I personally liked his style which made me listen on.

There are many podcasting feeds you can subscribe to                  at www.ipodder.org . These                  include regular podcasts from US Universities on education and                  technology. Even the BBC is getting in on the act. You can now                  sign up to the “In our Time” podcast where Melvyn                  Bragg and three guests investigate the history of ideas and debate                  their application in modern life.

<p>SHOW REPORT

<p>6. Online Educa Berlin 2004

<p>Epic's Donald Clark recently spoke at the Online                  Educa international conference in Berlin. Here is his report of                  the show.

<p>Online Educa is 10 years old this year and remains                  the leading European e-learning conference with:

<p>1700 registered participants from 60 countries

<p>attendees from 63 countries

<p>344 speakers from 43 countries

<p>71 themed sessions

<p>It’s an eclectic mix of researchers, educationalists,                  corporates and policy makers. Note that this doesn’t mean                  any real interaction between them. Indeed there were some fractious                  sessions and more than the odd culture clash (more of this later).                  In many ways this is what makes this an interesting event.

<p>A strong feature of the conference is the short                  speaker slots. Three or four speakers per session means they’re                  limited to about 20 mins each. This lowers the odds on boredom,                  and as the speakers still have to pay to attend the quality can                  be variable. In fact, this year, there was some disgruntlement                  around ‘presentation skills’.
