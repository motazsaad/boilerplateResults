Options after the comprehensive school are upper secondary school or vocational education. Upper secondary school: 2-year general school leading to the Matriculation Examination, giving successful students access to university and other higher education schools. The present vocational education system covers both general secondary and vocational programmes, with separate tracks for comprehensive school leavers and matriculated students. The system is being reformed.

<p>Higher education:

<p>Higher education in Ukraine is administered by the Ministry of Education  which coordinates the activities of higher schools and supervises the higher schools which are under other ministries. According to the "Law on Education", higher education includes the following levels and categories of establishment: level I -  vocational schools and other HEIs of a corresponding level; level II - colleges and other HEIs of a corresponding level which teach Bachelor and junior specialist courses; level III - institutes, conservatories,academies and universities that teach Bachelor's and Specialist, as well as junior specialist courses and ; level IV - institutes, conservatories, academies and universities which teach Bachelor's, Master's and Specialist courses. The degree system is under reform: The old system had only one stage of undergraduate studies, the degree of "Specialist", awarded after 5 years of study. The new system comprises two stages: undergraduate and graduate, with several degree levels. A Union of Rectors was created in 1993.

According to the "Law on Education", the following levels and categories of establishments offer higher vocational education: level I - technical and vocational schools; level II - technicums and colleges. They award the qualification of Junior Specialist. Level III institutes are university-level institutions. Graduates from post-secondary vocational schools must sit for final examinations and defend a graduation thesis/work.

The degree (Diplom) of Specialist is awarded after five or six years of study, depending on the type of institution.

The candidate's thesis can be prepared while following various forms of post-graduate studies.
