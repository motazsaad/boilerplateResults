<p>In         August 2002, Event Solutions proudly inducted an         inaugural class of 10 industry legends into the Event         Industry Hall of Fame. This is the fourth in a series         profiling each of the inductees.

<p>Dr.         Joe Goldblatt graduated from college in 1975 with a         Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in theater and business. "I wanted to pursue events as a profession, but         there was nothing... no official college program... in         events," Goldblatt recollects.

<p>He moved to         Washington, D.C. to work as a "nanny," and in         his off time dressed as a mime, performing magic tricks         for the people waiting to tour the FBI building.

<p>Through         this, Goldblatt met his wife, Nancy, who taught clowning         and was a performing artist. He reminisces, "We fell         in love, got married and started performing as mimes as         part of the Artists in our Schools program." For two         years, they traveled to schools nationwide, but when         Nancy became pregnant, they decided, " ... it was         best if we did not travel with our son."

<p>The         Goldblatt's began entertaining at special events held by         Washington area shopping centers. Their successful         performances evolved into producing shopping center         events and starting their own company: The Wonder         Company, Inc. "Our real motivation was to stay home         with our child; to have as normal a family life as         possible."

<p>As The         Wonder Company grew, they added staff. Goldblatt         developed training procedures for their staff and         freelancers. "I developed a training program, so         that I could manage the business and send trained         staffers out to produce events while I stayed in         Washington with my family."

<p>The Wonder         Company grew in size and reputation. Goldblatt again         found himself on the road, away from his family. So, he         sold The Wonder Company to a decorating firm in         Nashville, relocated there and worked for the new owner a         year. With the downturn of the economy, the new owner         defaulted and The Wonder Company returned to Goldblatt.

<p>Simultaneously,         Goldblatt began his career as an expert witness in the         field of events. As he researched cases, the quantity of         information available inspired him to develop a         curriculum for professional event planners, including         writing the necessary texts for instruction.

<p>In 1992, he         began exploring colleges and universities as possible         sites for this curriculum. The George Washington         University (GW) deservedly offered Goldblatt a full         scholarship to earn his master's degree and doctorate,         plus resources to develop his program, office space and         library support.

<p>From 1993 to         2001, the GW program grew from 25 students to 4000.         Goldblatt then licensed it as the Event Management         Certificate Program to 20 other universities around the         world.

<p>When asked         why he felt so passionately about creating this Event         Management Certificate Program and the ISES Certified         Special Events Professional (CSEP) professional         designation, Goldblatt responded, "I knew that every         industry, in order to be taken seriously, needs a         certification program."

<p>In 2001,         Johnson and Wales University, with 15,000 students of         hospitality, recruited Goldblatt. "They wanted to         draw on my expertise in events to develop their         program," he comments.

<p>Johnson and         Wales also made Goldblatt the Dean of the Alan Shawn         Feinstein Graduate School, and today, Goldblatt,         affectionately known as Dr. Joe, continues to inspire         hospitality students and faculty alike. Goldblatt is also         an internationally recognized speaker and has received         numerous awards for his work, including his induction         into the 2002 Event Industry Hall of Fame.

<p>by         Carolyn S. Baragona

<p>First                 Year in the industry:

<p>1976                 was my first year as a professional; however, I                 produced events when I was in college.

<p>What                 I thought I was going to be when I grew up:

<p>I thought I would be a producer of the Olympics,                 the Superbowl or the World's Fair.

<p>I                 got into the business because:

<p>I liked engaging people, bringing them together                 and creating mutually beneficial outcomes.

<p>Biggest                 event success:

<p>I produced the Opening of the Nashville                 Convention Center and the series of events that                 preceded the opening ceremonies. I started by                 designing a series of pre-opening events that                 brought people to the area and revitalized it.                 Because of this renewal, the opening event was                 well attended! I like to produce events that                 leave a legacy.

<p>Worst                 event disaster:

<p>In Denver, I once used fog during a gala.                 Twenty-nine Denver firefighters rushed into the                 room, carrying axes. The audience stood and                 applauded because they thought this was part of                 the show, that these were actors! The fire                 department ordered the room evacuated, but no one                 would leave. Everyone was so certain it was an                 act!

<p>Most                 valuable lesson learned:

<p>My most valuable lesson is the importance of                 communication and risk assessment.

<p>The                 best piece of advice I ever received:

<p>Fellow Hall of Fame inductee Jack Morton advised                 me, "Create things that endure. Whether it                 is a friendship or an event, do it so well that                 it will last."

<p>John                 Daly

<p>John                 Daly International

<p>In         August, Event Solutions proudly inducted an inaugural         class of 10 industry legends into the Event Industry Hall         of Fame. This is the fifth in a series profiling each of         the inductees.

<p>In         John Daly?s 37-year career, he has created events         around the world: Paris, Korea, Japan and other worldwide         sites have been treated to his creative style and         humanistic appeal.

<p>Daly         reflects upon his global body of work. ?Overseas,         they don?t do events the same way we do, because         they haven?t seen it,? he says. ?But once         they see what we are doing?it?s amazing. They         really get on board once they understand it. You         can?t translate a feeling, but you can translate         art. Art has a language of its own.? Daly thrives on         the interaction with artists of different cultures and         languages. He thrills at developing the common         communication between himself and the artists, and         realizing the vision together.

<p>Who would         believe that he started as a part-time florist?s         delivery boy working his way through college?

<p>?I         happened to be at the right place at the right time. From         delivering, I began to freelance in floral design. I also         worked for what they called at that time a ?party         shop? that did a lot of weddings and parties.?

<p>In the early         to mid ?70s, at a time when no such thing existed,         Daly decided to open his own company, strictly an event         company. ?Everybody thought I was absolutely crazy         to consider such a thing!? He started with 300         square feet of workspace. Within four years, he took over         the whole building, ran a fleet of trucks, and had built         his team to 35 people.

<p>Daly?s         team continuously took events to new levels. There were         no specialty linen companies then; they made their own         linens. There were no prop houses; they made their own         props. ?People were stunned, totally stunned.         That?s why it worked,? Daly mused while         considering the early days.

<p>The Beverly         Hilton, The Bonaventure, The Armitage all welcomed him as         their florist, while he still had his own special events         company and warehouse. From his initial venture as one of         the original event production companies, Daly?s work         has provided extraordinary experiences: Los Angeles? area great events, the State Department, corporate events         around the world, creating the Papal Altars, and most         recently, being selected to give roses to the loved ones         of those lost at the World Trade Center during the         memorial service.

<p>John Daly         has not only created a Hall of Fame career, he has         created the prototype of a Hall of Fame person:         thoughtful, creative, energetic and good.

<p>First                 Year in the industry:

<p>1966.

<p>What                 I thought I was going to be when I grew up:

<p>A psychiatrist.

<p>Biggest                 event success:

<p>I worked with Ray Thompson on an event for                 Gillette during the World Cup in 1998. We were in                 Paris, at Chantilly, a place like a miniature                 Versailles. We created Chantilly as it would have                 looked during the reign of Louis XIV. We                 re-landscaped the gardens, installed fountains in                 the lakes, and filled all the urns with floral                 arrangements. The guests swept down on an 80-foot                 by 150-foot long staircase to the sounds of                 baroque music and a water show. The event was two                 years in the making. Then all of a sudden, it was                 there, and it was exactly as we had pictured it.

<p>Worst                 event disaster:

<p>The ?worst? began as we were                 leaving for an event in Hawaii. I locked my keys                 and the tickets for a crew of 15 in my car, while                 it was still running. Then, on the island, a                 hurricane blew in and tore down every single                 thing we had put up. The rains came. We had roofs                 blown into the tent. I had ordered thousands of                 dollars of foliage for the ceiling. It arrived in                 one small box. So my crew went into the jungle                 with machetes to chop greens. Two minutes before                 the guests were to enter, the power was                 disconnected, and we had to rewire the tent.                 Finally, as we were packing up the boxes to                 leave, a bellman was helping with his box cutter.                 He cut one of my guy?s fingers nearly off.                 We don?t talk about that event.

<p>Most                 valuable lesson learned:

<p>Attitude is absolutely everything. How                 you approach people can make or break an event.                 Be flexible. I believe that nothing is                 impossible.
