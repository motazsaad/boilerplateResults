<p>In November 1918 she volunteered                   for service at Bizerta, a strategically important seaport in                  Tunisia, as a decoder and was highly recommended  by                 her commanding                 officer, Captain H.J. Rowley. She was turned down                 as                 she "had no decoding                 training". This inspite of a report written by Edith A May                 describing the nature of her work in Captain Rowley's office                 as being "decoding                 and                 confidential               transport work".
