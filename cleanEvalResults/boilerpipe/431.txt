<p>Absolutely a fantastic recipe. The best rib roast I've ever had, including some top notch steakhouses. A few things to consider, though. Firstly, the clay pot is not strictly necessary, but the even heat from all sides ensures the meat all gets done at the same time. This is the real strength of this recipe...uniform doneness all the way through, top to bottom, side to side. In higher temp recipes, the outer ring of filet meat(which is the best part) is always way overdone. With this recipe it was perfectly medium rare with a small 1/4 inch layer that was more done from the browning process.  Be warned, though, carry-over temp varies with the size of the roast. The smaller it is, the less it will carry over.

<p>Following these instructions for dry aging beef produced the best results I've ever had.  Even a mundane supermarket rib roast tastes incredible after 3 days of dry aging a la Alton Brown (it works with any cut of beef.)  This slow roasted rib roast was the best roast I've ever made - and I've been an avid home cook for 25 years.  Alton, you're the best!

<p>I tried this recipe on my BBQ, using the recommended rub and following the cooking instructions after "dry aging" for 72 hours.  It was a tight fit using the pot and saucer in the BBQ, but well worth it.  Also, cooking it at a low temp, letting it stand, then finishing off at 500 degrees kept it moist.  most awesome rib roast yet.

<p>Hands down, this was the easiest and best holiday dinner I've ever made.  I can't afford this every week or even every month, but the method/recipe worked so well, that I'm not afraid to "blow the wad' on this cut again for the right occasion.

<p>I have made this at least 6 times now and it comes out perfect everytime. I actually bought a terra cotta planter and base that just fits in my oven to cook it.  It is a pain, but it makes the best roast.  I have adjusted the cooking times a bit because we live in a high altitude area. This is the meal my dad asks for when it is birthday, anniversary and any time he can get me to make it for him.  Just add sweet creamed corn, scallopped potatoes and asparagus and you are set.

<p>I was scared to leave the high priced meat open in the fidge to dry age,  but patience eliminated my fear. Caution with the high heat at the end of this cooking.  Any "stuff in the oven will burn off and set off the smoke detector.  ( A great opportunity to have a family fire drill and a great meal afterwards.)  You must try this recipe.

<p>INDEED THESE WERE GREAT GOOD EATS! ?WORTH THE TIME TO PREPARE.  HOWEVER,  IF YOU ARE GOING TO SERVE THIS FOR A DINNER PARTY ASK  AB FOR SOME CORRELATION BETWEEN POUNDS OF MEAT TO TIME TO SERVE, ELSE THE  ACCOMPANIMENTS, AND GUESTS, MAY GET COLD OR OVERDONE BEFORE THE BEEF IS DONE.

<p>This is a great recipe.  It is easy and has quickly become a family favorite.  The low heat cooking method results in a very evenly cooked roast.  Wonderful if you love your roast beef rare.  Don't be scared off by the "Terra Cotta pot".  It makes sense if you have seen the show (remember this is Alton Brown).  It works very well in a pyrex dish covered with foil.  I have had somewhat inconsistant results with the au jus.  It can be a little salty from all the salt on the roast.  It depends how much falls into the pan during the cooking process. I have also "exploded" a pyrex dish on my range while deglazing.  Ooops.  Make sure you heat it evenly.

<p>even without the azalea pot...

<p>Follow the rest of the drill...I've done a couple of 4-ribs and a 7-rib. Same drill for all sizes, shapes. It may be the best rib roast you've had in your entire life...it will be medium rare-ish, though, deal with it...age it for 4-6 days if you can. It gets funky looking, but you will not believe the whole dang thing when you taste it. You will finally understand WHY you have taste buds. The sage au jus is easy/excellent.

<p>Good for pork too

<p>I didn't have a clay pot, but the rib roast still turned out great. I also cooked a cheap pork roast in the same manner (low, then high) and it was even more popular than the roast. Go figure. Like some of the other reviews, a better time estimate would've been helpful, but I was real lucky and both roasts were perfect doneness

<p>This is a fantastic recipe for cooking a great holiday meal. It is now a tradition for our family to buy a good sized rib roast (we go with a six bone roast) and to cook this with a whole smattering of side dishes. The meat is always flavorful and tender. It has a slightly peppery and salty quality that pervades the whole roast, but not enough to alter the natural flavor of the meat, just to draw out it's inherent flavors. The roast comes out with a nice medium well slice on either end of the roast and succulent rare slices in the center, truly a phenomenal thing for famlies that have differeing tastes on doneness. Excellent meal, bar none.
