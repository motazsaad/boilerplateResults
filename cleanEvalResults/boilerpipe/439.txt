<p>I think it's about time that they do a report on all these blogs being put out from pro-democracy Iraqis.

<p>I've seen a number of good ones like democracyiniraq.blogspot.com, iraqthemodel.com, among others.

<p>These are valuable, they contradict all the negativity we get out of the news 24/7

<p>Actually, the language quoted in the article is from a post of mine , and it's a little sloppy. I was refuting the theory that Buckhead expressed his detailed conclusions about the documents during the program. His opinions came a couple of hours after the program, as my post details. (My post also has the first public comments by Buckhead other than on FreeRepublic.com.)

<p>But I was fully aware that TankerKC (not "TankerC" as the article mistakenly calls him) had expressed generalized doubts about the documents during the program. I made that point clear in another post , in which I interviewed TankerKC. That post has a more detailed description of the evolution of the controversy here on FreeRepublic.com.

<p>In any event, thanks for posting the article, and once again, my hat is off to the Freepers who first raised doubts about the documents. It was a landmark event in the history of interactions between the internet and Big Media -- and it no doubt brought down Dan Rather's career early.

<p>I agree. I had the privilege of meeting Omar and Mohammed from Iraq the Model (I described the meeting here ) and it was an experience I'll remember all my life.

<p>Someone from the L.A. Times interviewed them that same night -- but the interview never ran. Too positive a story, I guess.

<p>The "secondary blogs" just picked up the scoops they found here on the FReep, and passed them along as their own.

<p>But that's okay. We don't mind. Goes with the territory.

<p>You probably didn't mean any offense, but I resent that if it's directed towards me. I sure did pick up scoops from this forum, but didn't pass them off as my own. The NPR/Media Matters post came from several sources: a reader of mine heard the NPR story, I found the Media Matters story, and I told Buckhead about both. He told me why they had gotten the timing wrong, but was reticent about being quoted. When I first did the post, he had not given me permission to quote him; in the update, he did.

<p>I always attribute things I get from other places, unless I have an agreement with the source not to disclose their identity. In all my posts where I picked things up from Freepers, I sourced them unless they had asked me not to.

<p>I don't mean to sound harsh, but you have to understand that accusing people of ripping off others' observations is considered an attack on our integrity. My integrity is everything and I can't have people getting the wrong impression.

<p>I don't even know who you are, or what secondary forums you represent. Don't take offense, but most of us don't know you either.

<p>Thanks for posting this Jim. It was not just Blather who ended up as a big loser this past year. Thanks to Free Republic and conservative blogs, ABCNNBCBS took a potentially lethal blow this year.

<p>Now we are doing the same thing with the liars/spinners suffering from Rummy Phobia.

<p>Merry Christmas Jim.

<p>"He said ABC News falsely concluded that posters on FreeRepublic.com ? the conservative news forum where the hoax idea germinated ? were the forgers of the documents"

<p>Well, finally someone has it right, Conservative News Forum. Not a blog!

<p>Travis - Patterico's been busting the LA Times's chops frequently (and most entertainly) for quite some time and his site just won the 2004 Weblog Award for sites ranked 100 to 250 in the TTLB Ecosysystem. Check it out. (Please note: I am not affiliated in any way with Patterico, other than as a frequent reader.)

<p>Also unmentioned was the microbiologist FReeper who used a computer-graphic program normally used to spot culture growth in Petri-dishes to overlay the fake memo with one produced in Word.

<p>They were identical, and he posted the graphic results here on FR.

<p>I sure wish I could remember his screen name...

<p>Never heard of him. It's all here on FR; I don't need to go off of FR just to read one more guy's opinions.

<p>Suit yourself. For my money, FR is not the be-all and end-all, just a wonderful gathering place for folks to discuss the news of the day. I enjoy FR along with a few other sites, such as Instapundit, Hugh Hewitt, NRO, Powerline, Patterico, Tech Central, Tim Blair, and of course Scrappleface (because "laughter is the bext medicine"). YMMV.
