<h>"The consumers who make the biggest difference (the busy ones, the ones who earn a lot, spend a lot, vote, talk a lot and change things) are the ones most likely to be online and least likely to watch TV."

<p>You think TV is tedious? You should see the people who work in it.

<p>As a cartoonist, I prefer blogging to publishing in old media. I like the total control. I like the one-on-one.

<p>Careerwise, I meet far more interesting people via blogging than I ever did working in TV or Madison Avenue.

<p>ALLEGORY: The difference between blogging and mass-media cartooning is like the difference between a glass of whisky in front of a fire with an old friend, and talking to a hundred random people in a nightclub.

<p>dream job

<p>Somebody recently asked me what my dream job would be.

<p>Being a professional cartoonist is not it. I absolutely loathe the bunker-dwelling lifestyle. I absolutely despise the market most cartoonists have to schlep in.

<p>Being a conventional advertising copywriter is also not it. Most copywriters are uninspired hacks with only a small bag of smartass tricks separating themselves and oblivion. Very few of them bring any seriously original thinking to their client’s problems. And very few clients ask copywriters for serious thinking as a result. They ask other people instead.

<p>My dream job would be to somehow combine the two.

<p>My dream job would be to license my drawing style to a company. I would draw them cartoons related to their business. On a deeper level I would apply The Hughtrain to their branding and their business.

<p>My contribution would be to give them a very unique voice with which to express their brand essence, which would also be informed by my rather ahead-of-the-curve brand and marketing theories.

<p>It would have to be the right company, though. A company with a great product, great people, a great corporate culture, and deep enough pockets to pay my salary.

<p>If you know anybody, please forward this page to them. Thanks.

<p>Joi Ito and others tell me the tech market is coming back. I'm thinking if I move again, it'll be to San Francisco, where people who have the same crazy kind of ideas as me seem to congregate.

<p>Watch this space.

<p>book outline

<p>I'm turning "How To Be Creative" into a book. Here is the rough outline for the publishing folk etc.

<p>(NB: The Book Proposal is here)

<p>"The Sex & Cash Theory: How To Be Creative In A Non-Creative World"

<p>"Sex & Cash" is a book about how to deal with the creative bug properly without it ruining your life.

<p>The book will have about 15-30 thousand words. It will be small and thick; I'm thinking 5 x 8 inches. Mixed in with the main text will be hundreds of my cartoons, which will compliment the writing.

<p>The Pitch: "Seth Godin meets Edward Gorey". You either get it or you don't.

<p>Introduction: "The best way to get approval is not to need it." This is the central message of the book. A lot of people daydream about living the creative life, about being a writer, artist, whatever, even if they don't really have anything to say or really want to do the actual work. This book is not for them. This book is for people who already have a few ideas of their own, who may already be well on their way, but maybe could use a wee push. It's not an instruction manual. It just shows where some of the land mines are buried, and gives direct and unapologetic advice on how to avoid stepping on them.

<p>It will be very different from the usual touchy-feely "Personal Creativity" fare. It'll have a bit more bite to it. It will not try to romantisize the creative life, nor try to convert people to living it. The aim is not to make the reader feel comforted, validated or make it all seem easier than it actually is. The main thesis of the book is just to get on with it; that only when one has dropped all those clichéd romantic daydreams about being creative, does the world actually start paying attention, do things actually start moving forward.

<p>The book introduction will have similar to the preceding two paragraphs.

<p>The book has four main sections:

<p>Section 1.  The Sex & Cash Theory: 500 words. "The creative person basically has two kinds of jobs: One is the sexy, creative kind. Second is the kind that pays the bills. Sometimes the task in hand covers both bases, but not often. This tense duality will always play center stage. It will never be transcended." (full text here...)

<p>Section 2. Cartoons drawn on the back of business cards. 3,000 words. An introduction to my work, and the story behind how the cartoon format came into being. It'll also show a few of my sentimental favorite cartoons, and the stories of how they came into being.

<p>"All I had when I first got to Manhattan were 2 suitcases, a couple of cardboard boxes full of stuff, a reservation at the YMCA, and a 10-day freelance copywriting gig at a Midtown advertising agency.

<p>My life for the next couple of weeks was going to work, walking around the city, and staggering back to the YMCA once the bars closed. Lots of alcohol and coffee shops. Lot of weird people. Being hit five times a day by this strange desire to laugh, sing and cry simultaneously. At times like these, there's a lot to be said for an art form that fits easily inside your coat pocket..." (more here...)

<p>Section 3. The Master List. 25-50 short chapters about absolutely everything I know on the subject of handling the creative process and the creative life. A few hundred words per chapter. Approx 10,000 words in total. (first draft here)

<p>1. Ignore everybody.

<p>2. The idea doesn't have to be big. It just has to change the world.

<p>3. Put the hours in.

<p>4. If your biz plan depends on you suddenly being "discovered" by some big shot, your plan will probably fail.

<p>5. You are responsible for your own experience.

<p>6. Everyone is born creative; everyone is given a box of crayons in kindergarten.

<p>7. Keep your day job.

<p>8. Companies that squelch creativity can no longer compete with companies that champion creativity.

<p>9. Everybody has their own private Mount Everest they were put on this earth to climb.

<p>10. The more talented somebody is, the less they need the props.

<p>11. Don't try to stand out from the crowd; avoid crowds altogether.

<p>etc. etc.

<p>Section 4. Epilogue: Now quit futzing around and go do it. 500-1000 words.

<p>"The pain of making the necessary sacrifices always hurts more than you think it's going to. I know. It sucks. That being said, doing something seriously creative is one of the most amazing experiences one can have, in this or any other lifetime. If you can pull it off, it's worth it. Even if you don't end up pulling it off, you'll learn many incredible, magical, valuable things. It's NOT doing it when you know you full well you HAD the opportunity- that hurts FAR more than any failure..."

<p>Well, it's a start. I'll keep you posted etc.

<p>greedcandy

<p>:Yes, another spike shoved my bandwidth above its quota late last night and caused my site to be down for 8 hours. I've sorted it out with my webmaster. It shouldn't happen again, he said, reaching for his checkbook.

<p>: Another diamond from Seth Godin:

<p>In a world where things are viral, you're more likely to succeed with passive networking (strangers recommending you) than the old school active kind. In other words, make great stuff, do your homework, build your audience and when you've got something worth talking about, people will talk about it.

<p>I love this guy. "Passive Networking". What a stunningly great term from a stunningly great paragraph.

<p>: Tom Peters' new blog is ferociously good. There's a reason why he gets the big bucks. My pet name for fun, motivational writings about business is "Greedcandy". It's a bit cynical, but hey, it was coined by me, so go figure...

<p>Anyway, Tom and Seth are my two favorite Greedcandy folk at the moment. [UPDATE:] Though I'm thinking Evelyn Rodriguez is getting damn close to stealing their crowns. Her stuff already goes beyond them both in a lot of ways.

<p>Hear that, Tom? You've got serious competition for a change ;-)

<p>"The best Scottish movie ever. An utter masterpiece of seething, beat-novel-film-noir sexuality." - Hugh MacLeod

<p>Ewan McGregor, Tilda Swinton, Peter Mullan, Emily Mortimer etc.

<p>Opened in USA April 16th, 2004

<p>Buy the artisically superior, far racier but more expensive NC-17 version from Amazon.co.uk.

<p>Been a while since I pimped Young Adam.

<p>The DVDs are out, so if you haven't seen it yet, well, your loss.

<p>Frankly, I'd recommend the NC-17/X-rated British version. Scenes were cut in the American version to make it fit the R-Rating.

<p>Disclaimer: one of my best friends, Dave MacKenzie directed it. So of course I'm biased.

<p>fun new biz model

<p>The corporate business model of the (very near) future is childishly simple to understand. Nike, Dell and Coca Cola already use it, and most big companies are gearing up to implement it ASAP.

<p>THE FUN NEW BIZ MODEL:

<p>The company is divided into two parts, Part A and Part B.

<p>Part A is much, much smaller than part B. Part B is huge.

<p>Part A is called "Creative".

<p>Part B is called "Outsourced."

<p>So, are you creative or are you outsourced?

<p>upstreaming

<p>I’m very interested in what is called “upstreaming”; one of those pesky buzzwords currently en vogue.

<p>“Upstreaming” basically means moving up the value chain.

<p>As a cartoonist, a good definition would be “upstreaming” from selling $25 cartoons to newspapers, to selling million-dollar movie ideas based on your cartoon character. Or in my case, “upstreaming” from showing free cartoons on the net, to selling my advertising services to one of my readers who has a business needing sold to a large audience.

<p>The whole frickin’ advertising businesses is currently going through a turbulent upstreaming phase at the moment.

<p>A lot of the things ad agencies are used to selling to their clients are not nearly as rare or valuable as they once were. And the people in the cubes doing the work are finding themselves less and less valued.

<p>An art director I know was laid off from Ogilvy's in New York about 2 years ago. He’s had a very hard time. His current situation is a total disaster. He’s 40 years old. Before the layoff his career had been less than spectacular.

<p>Forget to upstream and you end up like him: middle aged and crashing on a friend’s couch in The Bronx.

<p>history of chess pieces

<p>Chess pieces move the way they do for a reason:

<p>A drunk Scottish guy in a pub told me this story. Fisk away.

<p>Chess pieces are wee representations of ancient warfare.

<p>1. Pawns. Foot soldiers. They were ordered to advance, fight to the death, and never retreat. Manoeuvring a phalanx of them in any direction other than forwards was pretty much impossible until the advent of the highly trained, highly drilled professional soldier, which didn't appear until much later with the Romans.

<p>2. Knights. In ancient times, Calvary never advanced head on, but flanked i.e. they went around the back and attacked at the side.

<p>3. Rooks. The original chess rooks were not castles, but war elephants. Elephants are fairly unstoppable once they get going, but not very manoeuvrable. Hence they can go in straight lines- forward, backward, left, right- but little else. In ancient times war elephants carried little “castles” on their backs, from which archers would fire down (think Lord of the Rings). Europe has no elephants, but does have castles. So the latter caught on.

<p>4. Bishops. Chess predates Christianity in Europe. The original bishop pieces were actually sailing ships. Sailing ships never go straight, but tack to the left or right i.e. diagonal. The sail of the ship resembles the bishop’s crown. The bishops's crown was stylistically adopted in Europe during the Dark Ages, as Chistianity spread and naval warfare went into decline after the fall of the Roman Empire.

<p>5. The Queen. The Queen’s entourage was always looked after by a small, elite, highly trained bodyguard. The imperative to protect the women and children was very strong. If trouble was afoot it needed to get the hell out of Dodge very quickly. Ergo the bodyguard was very mobile and very deadly. It needed to be.

<p>6. The King, though powerful and free to choose any direction he wanted, was heavily laden with the apparatus of state. The King could not just drop everything and flee; he had the court, the treasury and the ministers weighing him down. So his movements were fairly limited.

<p>there is no silver bullet

<p>26. Write from the heart.

<p>There is no silver bullet. There is only the love God gave you.

<p>As a professional writer, I am interested in how conversation scales.

<p>How communication scales, x to the power of n etc etc.

<p>Ideally, if you’re in the communication business, you want to say the same thing, the same way to an audience of millions that you would to an audience of one. Imagine the power you’d have if you could pull it off.

<p>But sadly, it doesn’t work that way.

<p>You can’t love a crowd the same way you can love a person.

<p>And a crowd can’t love you the way a single person can love you.

<p>Intimacy doesn’t scale. Not really. Intimacy is a one-on-one phenomenon.

<p>It's not a big deal. Whether you’re writing to an audience of one, five, a thousand,  a million, ten million, there’s really only one way to really connect. One way that actually works:

<p>Write from the heart.

<p>they are no longer customers, they are now consumers

<p>A startup I know just got big and sexy. Now the people doing the actual work are pissed off because suddenly the management are starting to believe their own publicity. Suddenly the fancy-talk consultants are moving in. Suddenly for the first time the CEO is closing the door to his office so his underlings can’t hear him talking with the recently-hired marketing guys.

<p>Suddenly all transparency went out the window. This is amusing because the actual product is all about making their corporate clients more transparent.

<p>Suddenly plain speaking went out the window. This is amusing because the actual product is all about making their corporate clients more plain speaking.

<p>Suddenly the workers no longer feel they’re part of something, except perhaps making their bosses rich.

<p>The early adapters who first used the product with relish and spread the word during the company's infancy are no longer appreciated, nor is their feedback actively sought any more. They were useful once, but now they have served their purpose. They're now told to go back and get in line with the rest of the plebes. They are no longer customers, they are consumers.

<p>We both already know how this story is going to end.

<p>Part of my current job is helping prevent companies from falling into this trap.

<p>Feel free to write me if you wish to know more:

<p>some things get harder, some things get easier

<p>A few years ago, the ad agency I worked for in New York was sold to Euro RSCG, the international advertising conglomerate.

<p>The week of the paper being signed, the entire agency was crowded into this big room, and the then CEO of Euro RSCG, Bob Schmetterer, our new boss, gave us this big pep talk. We were part of this big global future that was happening or whatever.

<p>Fair enough. I kinda saw the vision. It made sense, sorta, at least from a senior management position. We grunts were less sure, but since when are grunts sure about anything senior management gets up to?

<p>So Bob opened the floor to questions. Nobody really had any, which I thought was odd. So to break the awkward silence I raised my hand.

<p>“In time of great change,” I asked, “some things get harder, some things get easier, and the harder bit is usually where the money is. What's the hardest part of your job now?”

<p>“Getting people on board,” said Bob. “Not everybody gets it.”

<p>In times of great change, some things get harder, some things get easier. Concentrate on the former, because that’s where the money is. I still use that thought with my clients today.

<p>I guess what interests me about any business is the hard parts. The easy parts are always overcrowded, underpaid and quietly dying.

<p>power is never given. power is taken.

<p>Artists, both famous and unknown, spend a lot of time waiting around for "The Big Yes Moment" to arrive. The moment where they get the greenlight. The moment where the publisher, producer, whatever finally calls him/her up and goes "Yes!"

<p>Yes! You are no longer pond scum. Welcome to the happy, shiny, Holy Order of Non-Failure. Yes! Yes!

<p>Yes! We're going to make your movie! Yes! We're going to publish your novel! Yes! We're going to give you a show!

<p>Yes! Yes! Yes!

<p>Go to any art opening, film screening or book launch in New York, Paris, London, Tokyo etc. The place is full of these people- artists killing time, drinking the free wine, working the room, trying to hide their fear and doubt, trying not to look desperate, trying to look like players, trying to feign relevance, trying to be as interesting and confident and amusing and networked as possible, all waiting around till their Big Yes Moment hopefully one day lands on their lap from an unknown direction. It doesn't matter if they're a 20-year-old art student or a 50-year-old Oscar Nominee. Their palpable unease carries the same vibe.

<p>Some lame-ass myth exists that if you're talented, hard working, savvy and networked enough, then one day power will be given to you.

<p>It doesn't happen like that. Power is never given. Power is taken.

<p>Power comes from sovereignty.

<p>Coined a new term. Heh.

<p>TROGGING: Trust + Blogging i.e. "Using Blogs to build trust and transparency."

<p>It occurs to me that my opinion of Microsoft has risen considerably in the last year.

<p>Not that I ever belonged to the "Bill Gates is Satan" crowd. I never was into computers enough to really care whether a guy in Redmond wrote the code, or some guy in Toledo. The same way I don't really care who made my telphone or my microwave, so long as it works. It's not an area where I project a lot of myself in to.

<p>Still, there is something quite monolithic about Microsoft, and one always keeps an eyebrow raised when something gets that big, quite rightly.

<p>So what happened? A new product? Nope. I still use the same Windows 98 and creaky, old Dell as always. Great new advertising campaign? Nope. Not watching much TV these days. Bill Gates gave all his money to cancer research? Nope. Not seen that much mention of him in the media recently.

<p>What happened in there's this guy called Robert Scoble who has a blog that I've been reading a lot this last 6-9 months. Robert works for Microsoft. Mark seems like a smart, honest, regular guy who holds down a job, same as the rest of us. He just happens to work for Microsoft. Robert writes about his job and his company the same way I would if I worked for them and liked my job. Informal, informed, friendly, it gives real insight about his company where possible- he tries to be as open and insightful as he can without disclosing trade secrets.

<p>It other words, he seems sane, reasonable, trustworthy, human and somebody who knows what he's talking about. Which to me helps make Microsoft seem likewise.

<p>One guy and his blog, doing more real good for his company than any multimillion dollar ad agency campaign could ever hope to achieve.

<p>As somebody in the ad business, I find the implications staggering.

<p>Long live Robert Scoble, King of the Troggers!

<p>UPDATE: Rick Bruner shows what happens when a company (in this case, Kryptonite Bicycle Locks) doesn't "trog":

<p>This is simply going to devistate Kryptonite. Too bad, I've always been a fan. Of course, this isn't principally a communication problem; it's a product problem. The only thing I could think that might save their business at this point would be a massive recall/refund for every customer with a U-lock. But this is also a communication problem. As a customer (I have four of their locks), I would really like to know whether this problem affect their other products, or whether it is limited to that Evolution 2000. But their communication on this sucks. The story broke online, yet there is nothing about it on their web site. They could really, really use a blog to try to contain the damage ASAP. But looking at their actions so far, I am not optimistic.

<p>Can you imagine how much money Kryptonite would have saved if they only had the foresight to let one of their smarter writers keep a company  blog?

<p>Companies that "trog" will remain. Companies that don't will die. You heard it here first. Fire your ad agency. Hire a blogger who knows what he's doing.

<p>NB: Yes, I know, "trogging" is a silly word. I'm not expecting it to catch on, frankly.

<p>my 10 best ideas

<p>I work in the advertising and branding business, coming up with ideas. These are my sentimental favorites.

<p>1. The Hughtrain: "The market for something to believe in is infinite."

<p>2. Movie Blogvertising. I was the first ever to use blogs as form of advertising for a commericaly-released film, as far as I know. Maybe somebody beat me to it, but my radar hasn't caught it so far. [Update: Radar just caught it: This was the first. Heh. But at the time I didn't know of it.]

<p>3. Seally Commerical: Killer Whale.

<p>
