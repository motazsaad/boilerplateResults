<h>If you don't find an answer to your question,

<p>please call 800-487-1074.

<p>Which airport should I book my flight into?

<p>Please schedule your arrival for Ferihegy Airport in Budapest, Hungary

<p>When should I arrive in Budapest?

<p>Please arrive at Ferihegy Airport In Budapest no later than 3:30 PM on the first day of the service program. If you plan your arrival for after 3:30 PM, you will be responsible for your own transportation to the Hotel Fáma in Hódmez?vásárhely, our host community. Bear in mind, however, that Hódmez?vásárhely is a three-hour drive from Budapest and that the only way to get there on your own might be by a combination of train and bus, which would involve at least two transfers. Should you be unable to purchase a ticket for the first day of the service program, please make arrangements to arrive prior to, not after, that date. Global Volunteers requires that all volunteers arrive by the scheduled start date of the service program.

<p>Will someone meet me at the airport?

<p>Provided you send your flight itinerary to Global Volunteers at least two weeks in advance of the service program start date and arrive during the designated arrival window, your team leader will be at Ferihegy Airport to meet you and your fellow team members from 12:00 PM to 3:30 PM. If you arrive before 12:00 PM, you can wait for your team leader in the arrivals area of Terminal 2B.

<p>What should I do if my flight is delayed?

<p>If your flight is delayed or you miss a connection, please notify Global Volunteers at 612-850-4750 as soon as possible of your new arrival plans so that we can inform your team leader. You can call either 800-487-1074 or 651-407-6100 during normal business hours (8 AM to 5 PM Monday through Friday, US central time), or call 612-850-4750 evenings, weekends and holidays. You can leave a voice mail message on any of these numbers if no one answers. However, if it is a weekend or U.S. holiday you must leave the message on 612-850-4750. If you must leave a message, it is important that you also contact the hotel where you are scheduled to stay and leave a message for the Global Volunteers' team leader.

<p>How can I get from the airport to the hotel on my own?

<p>Volunteers will be lodged at the Hotel Fáma in our host community of Hódmez?vásárhely, which is about a three-hour drive from Budapest to the southeast. Getting to Hódmez?vásárhely on your own would likely prove challenging, but were you to do so, one option would be the take a taxi from Ferihegy Airport to Nyugati Train Station in central Budapest. Then take a train from Nyugati Station to the southern Hungarian city of Szeged. From the Szeged train station, you could either take a second train to Hódmez?vásárhely or catch a bus (buses are yellow and are run by a company called Hódmez?), which would take you to a number of stops in downtown Hódmez?vásárhely (Hódmez?vásárhely is about 30 minutes from Szeged). It might also be possible to forego all of the above and hire a private car to take you the entire way from Ferihegy Airport to Hódmez?vásárhely, but such a service would be very expensive.

<p>If I am delayed, how late can I arrive at the Hotel Fama in Hódmez?vásárhely?

<p>Our orientation sessions are a critical component of the preparation for your teaching assignments. If circumstances beyond your control prevent you from reaching the program on the opening Saturday of the program (the program's first day), then we require that you arrive no later than 9:00 AM on the first Sunday.

<p>What should I do if I arrive prior to the scheduled arrival date?

<p>If you plan your arrival in Hungary before the designated program start date and choose not to meet the team leader at the airport, you will be responsible for your own transportation to the hotel.

<p>Will Global Volunteers make a reservation for me at the hotel if I arrive early?

<p>If you are arriving early and choose to stay at the Hotel Fáma, please contact the hotel to make reservations for your early arrival days. If you want to stay somewhere else, we recommend that you check the numerous guidebooks available on Hungary to find a hotel that fits your needs.

<p>If I plan to arrive where can I stay?

<p>Global Volunteers teams serving in Hódmez?vásárhely stay at the Hotel Fáma for the duration of the program. The hotel staff will be happy to reserve a room for you if you arrive prior to, or after the program dates.

<p>When making your reservation, identify yourself as a member of a Global Volunteers team. The cost of a single room costs between US$30 to US$45, and the cost of a double room usually runs from US$40 to US$55.

<p>At what time and on what date can I depart Hungary?

<p>Please plan your departure for 12:00 PM or later on the final day of the service program. Your team leader will accompany you to the airport to assist you with check-in. If you plan your departure for earlier than 12:00 PM on the last day, you will be responsible for your own transportation back to Budapest (a three-hour trip by private car). Similarly, if you choose to depart by rail or other means, you will be responsible for your own transportation.
