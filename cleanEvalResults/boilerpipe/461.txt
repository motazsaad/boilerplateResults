<p>When should I arrive in Brindisi?

<p>Please book your arrival at Brindisi airport no later than 6:30 PM on the service program arrival date. If you cannot arrive by 6:30 PM, you can either arrive a day or two early and stay at your own cost in Brindisi or the community where you will be serving, or arrive later that evening and make your own way to the hotel. However, if you arrive later, you may miss the initial orientation session scheduled for the first evening.

<p>You can also take the train from Rome. If you plan to arrive by train, you can go to Brindisi and meet the rest of the team at the airport. Or, if you are scheduled to go Ostuni, you can go straight to the Incanto Hotel without stopping in Brindisi. All trains coming from the north will stop in Ostuni before going on to Brindisi. You should get off the train in Ostuni (the station is on the outskirts of town) and take a taxi to the hotel. The cost of a taxi is approximately USD8 - 10.

<p>Will someone meet me at the airport?

Your team leader will meet you just outside the baggage claim area and will be displaying a Global Volunteers sign.
