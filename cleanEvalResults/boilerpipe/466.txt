<h>Class Gardens

<p>We commend the Loveland school board, superintendent and principals for creating an environment where an organization such as ours could evolve. Their willingness to expand educational opportunities outside of the four walls of the traditional classroom make it possible to offer a unique learning opportunity to our students.
