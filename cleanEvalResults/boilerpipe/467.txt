<h>Conditions for slave ownership and manumission 

<p> 

<p>It is important to point out that, in Athens at least, every citizen had the right to purchase as many slaves as he desired. There was, however, one very important condition: he was obligated by law to teach them a trade. Compliance with this condition required the expenditure of a sizable amount of money over and above the original purchase price. To ensure compliance, there were some very stringent laws in place that provided for punishment and fines for those who kept an unemployed slave (thoúlon argón). We remember the example of Xenophánes [the philosopher of Magna Graecia] who, when asked by Hiéron [the tyrant of Syracuse] to tell him how many slaves he owned, replied: "Two, and I am struggling to keep them fed."

<p> 

<p>From the above we can safely conclude that this form of "rudimentary adoption" required a certain degree of financial capability, not only for the day-to-day upkeep, but for the long term expenses as well. A financial capability that may well have been within the reach of a middle class citizen as far as the original purchase price was concerned, but over the years, with the ever-increasing competition from the metics and the freed slaves, together with the reduction of the value of land caused by pillage and interminable wars, this capability was constricted more and more. To the point, in many instances, where the citizen-owner was forced to either rent out his slaves, allow them to set up on their own in order to reduce his costs, or, as a last resort, manumit them. Should one wonder just what kind of advantages a citizen-owner could expect from manumitting a slave, we can think of two that come immediately to mind: 1) his expenses were reduced because he was no longer responsible for the slave's care and feeding, and 2) he received a significant sum of money in the form of either a lump sum payment or a steady income over time, as consideration for granting the slave's freedom. 

<p> 

<p>The process of manumission is executed either by the slave himself, or by an agent hired by the slave to negotiate and/or make payment to his master, thereby attaining his freedom. In most city-states, the ceremony of freeing a slave was performed according to traditional formulaic rituals, either in front of or inside a temple. The record of the procedure was then inscribed upon an interior wall of the temple for future reference. In Athens, however, the whole process was usually carried out in the law court or at the theater, by the making of a verbal or written proclamation stating the name of the slave about to be manumitted. The freeborn citizen had another advantage, which was that should the manumitted slave die without heirs, his or her estate would revert back to the former master. The manumission of a slave without some form of monetary or other consideration was a very rare thing indeed. Therefore, we can conclude that in order to purchase their freedom under the conditions imposed by custom and law, slaves had to have some means of obtaining a steady income. 

<p> 

<p>4.  Vocations and conditions of life of the slaves

<p> 

<p>Let us return now to the vocations which -- for the most part -- separated the freeborn citizens from the slaves. We do this to bolster our argument that the citizens were deeply and emotionally attached to the land, and were struggling hard to keep it, because they had lost ground in all other areas of the economy to the metics and freed slaves. Therefore, the possession of land was, either by custom or law, the essence and source of their right to proudly claim the title of freeborn citizens. To make our point, we submit the following facts about the situation existing in the agricultural areas of Greece.

<p> 

<p>In the 5th century B.C., there were no slaves in Central Greece [within which lies the "breadbasket" of the country]. In Plátaea [a city in southern Boeotía], in 431 B.C., the city was unable to muster a contingent of 110 female slaves. By the 4th century, slaves in Boeotía comprised 1/3rd of the total population. In Locris and Phocis [both in Central Greece], slavery was virtually unknown prior to the Persian attack in 480 B.C. And in Attica [the province within which Athens is located], not a purely agrarian area, the number of slaves working the land was minimal. Among a group of convicted lawbreakers in 451 B.C., whose estates had been forfeit and sold at auction, only one owned 16 slaves: a metic from Piraeus, whose offense was to violate the law forbidding him to own land. All of the rest, whose land and crops -- either standing in the fields or already harvested and in warehouses -- had no more than one or two slaves. 

<p> 

<p>In a catalogue of 131 manumitted [Athenian] slaves, not one of the 62 women mentioned had worked on a farm prior to being freed. Of the 69 men, there are only 7 who worked on the land as gardeners, and 2 who worked in the vineyards. On the other hand, in those areas that were more inclined toward commerce or light industry, slaves not only made up the majority, but outnumbered even the metics and the freeborn citizens. So that in 309 B.C., after the census of Demetrius of Phálerum, we get the following results: freeborn citizens, 21,000; metics, 10,000; slaves, 400,000. On the island of Aégina [in the Saronic Gulf, near Athens], the number of slaves approached 460,000 souls, whereas in Corinth 470,000. And on the island of Chios [in the Northern Aegean], there were many more than on Aégina or in Corinth, though we don't have precise figures. 

<p> 

<p>Let us look now at the salaries paid to slaves and freeborn. In 325 B.C., the 9 archons of Athens [the chief magistrates and office holders of the State], were each paid 4 obols a day, while, during the same period, the State paid skilled slave craftsmen at the rate of 3 obols per day, plus meals. In 325, members of parliament [voulé], received 5 obols per day, whereas jurors [heliaiastés] got 3. We take note, therefore, that in the 4th century B.C., a slave received an equal salary with a freeborn juror, and a slightly lower salary than a magistrate or a member of parliament. Any comparison with more modern times regarding this issue is sure to leave us with many questions pertaining to the definition of the word "slave," then and now (1).

<p> 

<p>We further take note that in 400 B.C., a family of 3, together with their 2 slaves, had a yearly expenditure of 1000 drachmas, whereas, in 370 B.C., the young Demósthenes, with his mother and sister, and with no slaves, needed 700 drachmas per year. When we factor in an estimate of the increase in the cost of living which took place in the intervening 30 years, we find that the slaves -- in both periods -- averaged a daily salary of about 3 obols, which was naturally paid them by their owner. This applied to leased slaves as well, where the freeborn citizen was also required to provide food, lodging, clothing, etc., for the slave during the term of the lease. So that we have -- in the 4th century B.C. -- domestic, leased, and publicly owned slaves earning a steady and secure wage amounting to about 3 obols per day. If we add in the cost of clothing, feeding, and housing, we see that their actual salaries amounted to even more.

<p> 

<p>From Aristóphanes' great comedy, "Plútus" ["Wealth"], performed in 380 B.C., we learn that shoes cost 8 drachmas and himations (2) cost 20. In 330 B.C., shoes for slaves cost 6 drachmas, and the chiton (3) worn by slaves cost as much as 7. We must also add the cost of medical treatment for the slave, as well as the cost of teaching him a trade, as was required by law. From all of the above, it is abundantly clear that it was entirely possible -- if not probable -- that there would come a time when a middle class Athenian citizen with a low income, who wished to maintain a slave in accordance with law and custom, ran a real risk of dropping precipitously to the status of the "newly poor," because in order to do so he would probably have to mortgage his land, in which case he ran the risk of losing both his land and his most prized possession of all: that of citizen of Athens, as we've already seen happen after the defeat of Athens in the Lamian War of 322 B.C. As a result, we see that year after year there are more and more slaves manumitted by an ever greater number of middle class Athenian citizens. Either that, or they were subjugated to the State, metics, or wealthy Athenians who could afford them. They were also leased out to commercial or small industrial interests at an ever increasing rate. It is during this period that the slave essentially becomes strictly a household servant of the wealthier families of Athens. Actually, things have not changed that much down through the centuries: The main differences being that the Athenian slave had much better future possibilities, more respect, more rights, and better [weighted] monetary compensation than the serfs of the Middle Ages and Czarist Russia, the slaves of the ante-bellum American South, or the "wage slaves" of more recent times.

<p> 

<p>Let us turn now to the much-heralded and much-bemoaned slaves who worked in the mines of Laúrium (4). The importance of these mines (right through to about 370 B.C.) was negligible after the revolt of the metal-working slaves which took place during the last few years of the Peloponnesian War. In all of that time, right from the end of the war in 404 B.C., no major Athenian venture capitalist saw fit to invest in these mines. Add to this the fact that only a small number of poor Athenian citizens worked there for their own benefit -- which indicates to us that production had fallen a great deal -- and we can understand why there was a crisis at the mines at this time, and why the whole operation was in a very bad state.  

<p> 

<p>When considering that the majority of the slaves working in the mines were leased, that the freeborn mine operators were paying a minimum of 1 obol per day to their masters, and that they had the further expense of clothing and feeding their charges -- in addition to which they had to contend with a general economic depression in the Athenian economy due to Athens' defeat in the aforementioned war -- we can see why the wages of the slaves at Laúrium were not up to par. We then come to realize that the revolt was not due to any ill-treatment of the slaves, but was most likely the result of the slaves coming to the conclusion that, considering the arduous labor involved, working in the metal mines was not a profitable enough occupation. This realization is strengthened by the later indifference on the part of the venture capitalists to continue operations in Laúrium, which allowed the poor citizens of Athens to come in and try to scratch out a living. It is not until 367 B.C. that activity at the mines is revived, only to peak at around 350 B.C., after which time there is a steady decline. All of which begs the question: Why weren't there any revolts during the many years that the mines were productive under Athenian hegemony? The answer is simple: it was because during this period the slaves were content and satisfied.

<p> 

<p>As regards the laws governing the rights of the slaves, we can add the following: Slaves could appear as plaintiffs in an action against their masters who were forced to appear to defend themselves. They had the legal right, as previously mentioned, to have their own money. However, although they were not subject to monetary fines when they broke certain laws, they could suffer corporal punishment instead. In Athens, a slave's master did not have the right to take his life. A slave who suffered abuse and who sought sanctuary had the right to be sold to another master. For these and other reasons we read the following lines in the Hecuba by Euripides: "For you Greeks, both the free man and slave are protected by the same laws governing homicide." What is important here is that old Queen Hecuba is not talking about Athenians only, but of all Greeks, which tends to indicate that there was a common, pan-Hellenic code of behavior toward slaves in place at that time. Also, an Athenian who murders his slave is ostracized from the city, a fate considered to be worse than the death penalty. 

<p> 

<p>To continue with the rights that a slave enjoyed, we see that there were no restrictions which told him how to dress; as a result, he looked no different from a freeborn Athenian working man on the street or in the agora. He could speak freely on any subject, sometimes even verbally abusing his listeners, as anyone who has read Greek comedy can verify. The Athenians and all Greeks relied upon their slaves to fulfill the important role of teachers [paidagogós] to their children. Demosthenes, in his Against Meidias, talks about a law which refers anyone who "corrupts the morals of a child, woman, freeborn man, or slave by committing an illegal act against their person" to the Assembly [Heliaia] for trial. Demosthenes goes on to say: "You have all heard, O Athenians, how philanthropic is the spirit of that law, which protects even the slave." From Demosthenes we also learn that slaves were protected by and subject to the Athenian laws governing commerce. They had the right to be captains of [merchant] ships, to represent their masters as agents in the  foreign ports they visited, and to appear as litigants in the courts of law in which cases having to do with commerce were heard. As far as income is concerned, we have some pretty startling examples of just how adept some were at accumulating wealth, such as in the case of Demetrius of Phálerum's cook, who earned enough money in two years to buy three houses.

<p> 

<p>5.  Slaves in Lacedaemonia

<p> 

<p>Let us inquire now as to the condition of the slaves in Sparta, where they were called helots [éilótes]. There, as opposed to the rest of Greece, the helots were strongly tied to the land. This situation is explained by the fact that in Sparta power was entirely vested in the government, and not in the people [démos] as it was elsewhere in Greece. Spartan citizens were outnumbered ten to one by the helots, who were in essence the property of the State. The citizens had the services of the helots who were assigned to them by the State and who farmed the land as sharecroppers, but they had no right to either free them, or to increase or decrease the yearly portion that the helots were obliged to give to them. The size of this portion was determined by the Spartan State, and was usually about 70 bushels [médimni] of barley for every Spartan (this increased when he married). 70 bushels came to approximately 60 hundred-liters in weight, with an equivalent amount of wine, and 30 hundred-liters of olive oil additionally assessed. This state-imposed ordinance had a stabilizing effect upon Sparta, since it allowed its citizen-soldiers to concentrate on their most important duty, which was the defense of their country. In order to properly fulfill this duty they were expected to turn away from all other cares, demands, and pleasures of life. 

<p> 

<p>At this point, it is important to emphasize that these levies had been enacted by the State during a year when the harvests were particularly small. The result, of course, was that when the yields were above average or even just average, the excess did not go to the Spartan master, who could expect only that portion of the harvest due him by law, but to the helot and his family. This situation could sometimes put the helot into the category of an independent farmer, and not just a subsistence sharecropper. To this we must add that when booty was acquired on campaigns in which the helots took part, any plunder taken by a helot was his to keep, which meant that it was also his to sell. In this way, and under this system -- where the yearly income of the citizens was fixed and unchanging -- there was created in Laconía a society where the masters grew steadily poorer, while the helots, year by year, increased their wealth. As further proof of this, we offer the following: When Cleoménes, the king of Sparta, needed to raise money for the State, his proposal that this be done by giving the helots the right to purchase their freedom was adopted by the Ephors [Magistrates]. 6000 helots took advantage of this opportunity and the sum which accrued to the benefit of the Spartan treasury amounted to a total of 500 talents. In other words, 6000 helots were in a financial position to pay over the sum of 5 silver minás [mnéa] apiece for their freedom: a very respectable sum in those days, and indicative of their financial independence (5) .

<p> 

<p>It must also not escape our attention that all of the contemporary criticism regarding the conditions under which the helots lived never seem to compare these conditions with the ones under which the Spartan citizen himself had to live. To demonstrate, in other words, how the citizen was treated by the State in comparison to how the helot was treated. If one were to compare these two entities within the framework of  Spartan society, one would soon come to realize that whether it be in the military, the economic, or the political realm of Spartan life, the laws under which the citizen-soldier lived were harsher by far than those governing the helot. This because, as previously mentioned, the helot was considered to be the property of the State, and no Spartan citizen had the right to harm or destroy him, just as no Spartan citizen had the right to harm or destroy any other State property. Only the Spartan military government could determine a helot's punishment, and never a private citizen.

<p> 

<p>We will now enquire into the "krypteia," because the truth needs to be told about this much-misunderstood institution of Spartan life as well. We see the word krypteia, and learn about what it means for the first time, from the great Lacedaemonian lawgiver, Lycurgus. It was designed to teach young Spartans how to steal food so as to be able to survive under harsh wartime conditions (6). It was, therefore, part of their training which, in addition to their barely adequate "Spartan" diet (7), inspired them to devise impromptu food-gathering survival skills that would be of life-saving value to them in the years to come. In spite of this, however, should the Spartan youth be discovered and caught, he was whipped and put on reduced rations. It was Plato who made this law, given to the Spartans by Lycurgus, well known among the Greeks. And, much later, it would be Aristotle who made the law of krypteia synonymous with the training of young Spartans to stealthily murder those helots thought to be a threat against the Spartan State. In truth, the helots were anything but a threat to Sparta.

<p> 

<p>Let us see now just who these helots actually were. The [Greek] geographer, Strabo, tells us (G.35) that the first capitulation of the Laconians to the Dorians came about as a result of a treaty which granted the former equality and a measure of civil rights. However, at around 1000 B.C., under the rule of Agis, the son of Euresthénes, this treaty was violated. The result was an uprising by the inhabitants of the territory of Helos, after which, when the Spartans had put down the revolt, the name helots gained currency and came to mean those descendants of the original inhabitants of the country. From that time forward, the helots became part of the almost totally peaceful and harmonious population, all of whom came to be known as Lacedaemonians. The helots served in the army and the navy. In the navy, they served as rowers, and in the army as adjutants, porters, and even armed troops [hoplites]. Should a helot distinguish himself in battle, he would be given his freedom and be graduated to higher category; that of a neodamódon [newly-enfranchised citizen] as a reward for his bravery. Another category was that of móthones, who were the children of a helot mother and a Spartan father. These children were brought up as foster brothers and sisters of the Spartans, and both sexes received the same training and upbringing as any other Spartan child. They could, in time, attain full Spartan citizenship, which brought with it all the rights, privileges, and obligations of a full-fledged Spartan.

<p> 

<p>Which brings us to ask the following: How is it that these so-called "enemies" of Sparta were able to receive Spartan military training, and even allowed to bear arms during wartime? And why, since the helots so outnumbered their "masters," the ratio in war being in excess of 7 to 1, weren't the Spartans afraid that the helots would turn on them or desert to the enemy?  In spite of many opportunities to do so, there is not one instance of desertion by helots during a battle to be found in the ancient sources. On the contrary, at the battle of Thermopylae, the helots chose to die to the last man instead of deserting to the Persians, as the Thebans did. 

<p> 

<p>Going back to the Spartans and the helots, we will refer now to a third class of inhabitants of Lacedaemonia; the perioíkoi [literally, "dwellers around"]. These "neighboring peoples" (8) had won the right to claim the lion's share during the first land distribution lottery instituted by Lycurgus. From the 39,000 klérous [lottery tickets] distributed, the perioíkoi received 30,000 and the Spartans only 9000. Another fact which exposes the lie about how unfair the Spartans were, and how they oppressed the rights of all who were not pure-born citizens of Sparta. Equality in the joys and pleasures of life was the rule, but no equality existed when it came to the duties and obligations of a Spartan: Such things fell to him alone within the purview of the Spartan way of life, and its harsh ethic of military greatness. 

<p> 

<p>Closing now with our references to Sparta, we remember the words of Archidámus, one of Sparta's great kings, as recorded by the historian Thucydides: "There are no differences between one man and another, only the superiority that one achieves who has been trained in the hardest school."

<p> 

<p>6.  Slavery in Thessaly, Crete, and other parts of Greece

<p> 

<p>There were slaves in other parts of Greece besides Athens and Sparta. In Thessaly, they were called penéstai and thettaloikétai; in Sicyon, korinophóroi; in Argos, gymnítai; in Crete, klarótai, mnoítai, afamiótai, thóloi, and oíkeis, and in Locris, oikiátai. Corinth's tyrant Periánder, the son of Cypsélus, banned the purchase of new slaves in a measure designed to help the thétes (9), most of whom were unemployed and starving. Aristotle tells us he did this because he wanted "even the mediocre to prosper," so as not to think about wanting to have a say in running [or overturning?] the government. In Thessaly, the penéstai were landowners and homeowners. They could have a family, worked wherever they wished, and were free to carry weapons. Under such conditions, it should come as no surprise that some acquired more wealth than their masters.

<p> 

<p>In Crete, conditions were even more liberal. From the great "Gortyn Inscription," discovered in 1884 near the modern-day village of Aghoi Déka in the South Central part of the island, we learn much relating to how the institution of slavery was viewed in ancient Crete. Noteworthy is the fact that fully 1/3 of the text -- referred to as the "Code of Gortyn," -- has to do with slavery. Slaves had the right to acquire property; meaning, of course, that they could accumulate and possess wealth. They were required to pay fines; which meant that they had the right to possess not only real estate, but personal property as well. From the historian Ephorus (10), we learn that the klarótes were personal slaves who were intimately involved in the lives of their masters. In Kydonía, there were special festivals and holidays set aside exclusively for the slaves. During the celebration of these festivals, the slaves had the right to "beat" freeborn Cretans. ... Callistratus [4th century B.C. orator] tells us that the Cretans, in order to avoid saying the word "servant" (which had a slightly negative connotation, just as it does today), would refer to their domestics as mnoítai, thereby hinting that they were the descendants of King Mínos himself (11). 

<p> 

<p>There is much more that could be said about the rights, duties, and conditions of life of the slaves in the ancient Greek world. Surely, this study does not come anywhere near exhausting the subject, and simply "scratches the surface," so to speak. There are, of course, omissions and differences of opinions concerning this topic which have not been addressed. The attempt was to present this important subject in an objective and serious manner, and to do so within the framework of the socio-political and economic conditions which were prevalent at the time, thereby avoiding the distortions and politically correct interpretations inspired by present-day attitudes and fashions. To examine the facts, and to avoid falling into the pitfall of catering to the current "-isms" which are directed more by self-interest than by a scholarly search for the truth. To demonstrate that the role of the slave was different than that of the free citizen, but not necessarily inferior, without degrading or romanticizing either one. To show, in other words, as much as is possible in a quick study, just what the words "slave," and "slavery" meant to the ancient Greeks. The Hellenic race deserves and demands to know the truth regarding its history, because it has been subjected to historical distortions and outright lies long enough.
