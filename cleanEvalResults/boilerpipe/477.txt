<p>There are seven steps employers should take to prevent workplace                  injuries and illnesses costing the British economy £14 billion                  annually, cut the 14.5 million days of sickness absence a year                  caused by work-related illness and injury, and prevent 27,000                  workers leaving the workforce permanently every year because of                  workplace injury and ill-health, according to TUC research.

<p>Insurers and TUC get rehab

<p>A national action plan is needed to revive Britain's inadequate                  rehabilitation services say the Association of British Insurers                  (ABI) and the TUC. Delays in treatment, lack of resources and                  a disjointed approach mean that the UK lags behind most other                  industrialised nations in the help it provides to sick workers.

<p>Ready reckoner

<p>The UK Health and Safety Commission (HSC) has          launched a "ready reckoner" for Britain's businesses to help them work          out how much work-related accidents and ill-health is costing them. Sixty          thousand copies of the ready reckoner are being distributed to union safety          reps through the TUC.

<p>What it costs to hurt you

<p>The European Agency for Safety and Health at Work has produced a new            tool to "improve occupational safety and health and to increase the            competitiveness of your business." It allows you to calculate the additional            cash flow that would be generated if the firm invested in specific preventive            measures - a standard "cost-benefit' analysis."
