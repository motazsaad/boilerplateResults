<p>Come see how local designers use their 3D software. Which one is the            best? Is there a perfect software just for us? We will explore these            questions while Kent Solberg of Sram, Bart Brechja of Design-Engine.com,            Aaron Eiger of Design Integrity, and Chris Houghton of Insight model            up something cool for us! We will look at Rhino, Pro E, Alias, and Solid            Works.
