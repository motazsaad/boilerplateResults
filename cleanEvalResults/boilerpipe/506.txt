<p>This 1938 pamphlet gives an insight both into the work of local                educational settlements and national adult colleges. Of particular                interest here is the account of the influential work undertaken in                'special areas' (mining areas where there was high unemployment).                It also provides us with a brief overview of the Association                itself.

<p>The Educational Settlements Association (founded in 1920) consisted of 29 settlements and seven residential colleges at the                time of this publication (they are listed in the appendix). Most                of the settlements in                membership were non-residential.

<p>[page 1] DURING the last thirty years a new        educational development has been taking place—the growth of Residential        and non-Residential Colleges for adult students, or what is more generally        known as the Educational Settlement Movement. The idea of the Movement is        that of education in community and in it many people have found a deep and        abiding interest and concern. Because of its value and infection it is now        shared by a very much wider public than formerly.

<p>“The assertion of truth, the unveiling of illusion, the dissipation of        hate, the enlargement and instruction of men’s hearts and minds” are some        of the indispensable and urgent duties and services of our time and all        true citizens should be identified with them. For many, I feel sure, the        effective medium for the discharge of these duties and the fulfilment of        these services is to be found in the Movement with which this pamphlet is        concerned.

<p>Community education

<p>[page 2] The age in which we live has been described as the        golden age of applied science, the millennium of social facilities. The        development of industry, the amazing progress of scientific invention, and        the increasing dominance of the machine over life, both in work and in        leisure, have profoundly influenced the moral, spiritual and intellectual        attitude and outlook of all, and have reset the problem of human worth and        conduct.

<p>Universal elementary education, the flooding of new knowledge through        hitherto undreamt of channels, the demands upon attention and interest        through cinema, advertisement and daily Press, and the fascination of        speed and the desire to be on the move “, are factors which have gone        deeply into our lives and have made it imperative that we should take        serious stock of our situation if we are to preserve the unity of our        lives as individuals and as a people, let alone break new ground in the        experiment of living.

<p>The resistless spirit of man has driven him forth to discover the        utmost limits of the objective world—to sail its mighty oceans, climb its        highest peaks, sound its depths and mount its heavens, master its stubborn        resistance and exploit its material resources. The quest has been        unremitting, eager and thrilling, but it has not been concerned with what        matters most, namely, a true human motive, a sufficient “end” for all its        stupendous tasks and efforts.

<p>Indeed, what is coming to be seen with no small measure of alarm is        that “means” have been regarded as “ends “, that things have been thought        of as something worthy in themselves, and that human beings may be        sacrificed to them; that unless a worthy human purpose or use can be found        for them the opportunities and inventions of the scientific age may prove        delusive and destructive of man.

<p>Whilst man has been absorbed in the discovery of the remote countries        of the world he has neglected to press forward in the discovery of that        hidden country in the mind and spirit. There is so much of this terra        incognita lying undiscovered in ordinary men and women, and its        unveiling is so important both to us and to society at large, that the        penetration of it and becoming at home in it is one of the imperative        necessities of our time.

<p>“Who “, says Fuller, “hath sailed about the world of his own heart,        sounded each creek, surveyed each corner, but that there still remains        much terra incognita in himself?” It is the discovery of this terra        incognita that is civilization, and it is one of the functions [page 3]        of education to bring it about, not only in the exceptional person but in        the ninety and nine, in the ordinary everyday average man and woman.

<p>It is this service of discovery of the “inward man “, this search for a        true knowledge of ourselves, this reaching up to the full stature of        manhood and womanhood, this blending of the spiritual and the intellectual        in a unified personal life, this dedication to a worthy human ideal, that        is implied in the word “ education”, and that is our important business.        It cannot be imparted to children even by the best of teachers; it cannot        be given to adolescents; but it can and must be achieved by men and women        in fellowship of understanding and corporate dedication to the search for        true knowledge, in a united determination to serve the noblest conception        of life yet bequeathed to man.

<p>This Community Education is the purpose of the Educational Settlements        Association through its Residential Colleges and Educational Settlements.

<p>The Association

<p>The Association is a voluntary organization for adult education. It was        founded in 1920 and to-day comprises seven Residential Colleges and        twenty-nine Educational Settlements or non-Residential Colleges. For        directory, see pages 15 and 16.

<p>Status. The Association is a Responsible Body under the Board of        Education Adult Education Regulations for the purpose of submitting formal        classes and receiving grants in respect of them.

<p>Finance and Management. The Association is governed by a Council        composed in the main of representatives of the constituent institutions        affiliated to it. It is maintained from voluntary sources and for the        purposes outlined in this pamphlet administers funds entrusted to it by        Educational and other Trusts.

<p>Scholarships and Bursaries. The Association awards annually a        limited number of bursaries to men and women wishing to proceed to one or        other of the Residential Colleges for a course of full-time study. Also        from time to time it awards travel bursaries for students.

<p>Affiliation. Among the conditions of affiliation to the        Association are: (1) That the College or Settlement must have a Governing        Body and in the case of a Settlement a student membership which is        represented on the Governing Body. (2) That the education given must be        non-party in politics and non-sectarian in religion.

<p>Consultation and Advice. The Association is a clearing house for        information concerning various aspects of Settlement [page 4] and        College work and of vacancies and opportunities arising in connection with        them. Interviews with prospective workers in the movement are arranged and        because of its extensive and varied experience the Association is        competent to give advice on questions relating to the kind of training and        initiation needed for it.

<p>Contact with the Wider Movement. The Association keeps in        effective touch with its constituent bodies by representation on their        respective committees and councils, by the holding of regular meetings of        representatives and other members of Colleges and Settlements, by the        regular visitation by the Secretary and members of the Executive Committee        and by the arrangement of Conferences.

<p>Co-operation in the work of the wider movement of Adult Education is        effected by representation on such bodies as the Adult Education Committee        of the Board of Education, the Workers’ Educational Association, the        National Central Library, British Drama League, National Adult School        Union and other kindred organizations.

<p>The Association is responsible for the administrative and publicity        work of the Joint Committee for Residential Adult Education which was set        up to bring together the Residential Colleges and the Supplying Bodies in        Adult Education. This Committee is composed of representatives of the        University Extra-Mural Boards, the Trades Union Congress, the Central        Joint Advisory Committee on Tutorial Classes, the Workers’ Educational        Association, Association of Education Committees and the Residential        Colleges.

<p>Literature. The Common Room—the journal of the        Association —is published three times yearly. The purpose of this journal        is for the interchange of news and opinions each term among all who are        interested in the work of Educational Settlements, Residential Colleges        and the wider movement of Adult Education.

<p>Residential Colleges for Adult Education—published on behalf of        the Joint Committee for Residential Adult Education, and descriptive of        the opportunities for full-time study and scholarships and bursary        provision made in respect of it.

<p>Community Education— being a description of the work of the        Residential and Non-Residential Colleges for Adult Education.

<p>From time to time the Association publishes information concerning the        College and Settlement movement.

<p>The Common Room may be had for an annual subscription of is., or        at 3d. per copy. The other publications referred to are free.

<p>Enquiries. Enquiries concerning any of the matters referred to        in this pamphlet will be welcome and information in respect of the        Colleges or Settlements will be gladly supplied. [page 5] 

<p>The residential colleges

<p>A body of students sharing a common life under a common roof with their        own tutors, their own lectures and classes, Residential their own library        and common room, their own societies for discussion and for sport and        recreation—the residential college is a unique and valuable feature of the        older English universities which is rarely found abroad, and is only        partially realized in the men’s and women’s hostels of the newer        universities in this country.

<p>To bring an opportunity for at least one year of continuous study under        such conditions to working men and women of adult years (the ages range        from nineteen to sixty, with an average between twenty-five and thirty is        the aim of the Residential Colleges for Workers which have sprung up        during the present century.

<p>There are now seven colleges of this type. The oldest is Ruskin        College, Oxford, founded. in 1899. The youngest is Newbattle Abbey, near        Edinburgh, founded a year ago.

<p>Ruskin College is open to both men and women students for either one        year or two years. Second-year students may enter for Diploma examinations        in the University of Oxford, and the lectures and libraries of the        University have been generously put at the disposal of the students. The        College is governed by representatives of the Trades Union Congress        General Council, and of other working-class organizations, together with        three University “advisers “. Students for the most part come by means of        scholarships or grants provided by Trade Unions, Educational Trusts, or        Local Education Authorities.

<p>Fircroft College at Bournville, Birmingham, was modelled on the Danish        Folk High School, and has the advantage of access to the lectures and        other facilities of Woodbrooke and the other Selly Oak Colleges. Avoncroft        College, near Bromsgrove, is specially designed for agricultural workers,        and combines cultural and vocational interests. Hillcroft College,        Surbiton, is the only working women’s college. Coleg Harlech is a Welsh        foundation, though not exclusively confined to Welsh students. All these        colleges are recognized for grant by the Board of Education, and are        affiliated to the Educational Settlements Association, in which they form        a Colleges Group.

<p>These colleges aim at providing selected adult students with the        opportunity of continuous study, unhindered by the many obstacles which        confront the worker-student living at home— [page 6] scanty or        scattered leisure, lack of privacy and quiet, and the pressure of private        engagements or public work.

<p>They present many advantages which the Tutorial Classes or the W.E.A.        course in a locality cannot give—regular weekly private tuition,        association with several tutors, a wide range of subjects, easy access to        books and guidance in reading, as well as the enrichment of intercourse        with fellow students of diverse occupations, from different parts of the        country, and sometimes from overseas.

<p>And what happens to students after they have left the colleges? In        earlier and more prosperous times the most of them would return to their        occupations and localities, there probably to engage in educational,        social, or political work among their fellows. But to-day there are many        who seek for new openings and callings,, either because they cannot find        work in their previous occupations, or because they are anxious to find        more congenial work.

<p>Among the students, for example, several have entered on fulltime        educational work with the W.E.A. or the Co-operative Movement, others have        been engaged as research officers in their trade unions, others elected to        Parliament, while not a few have qualified for special forms of social        service, such as probation work, and one or two are parsons. Recently, a        number have found a useful place as leaders in the Educational Settlements        and Community Centres that have sprung up in the Special Areas, or on new        housing estates.

<p>But the results of residential adult education are not to be measured        in terms of easily recorded after-careers, or achievements in public life;        the most significant results are the imponderable ones that take place in        the mind and spirit—the expansion of interest, the growth of character and        insight, the loosening of prejudices and strengthening of principles.

<p>The collection of students’ sayings in Learn and Live bears witness to        the fruits that may be, though they are not always, gathered from the life        at college. “He put my hand on a new latch,” says one student of his        tutor. And another says quite simply: “He introduced me to myself.”

<p>It would be difficult to find a better phrase to describe one of the        most important effects of college life. For, after all, there are many men        and women who have never really been introduced to themselves, or who are        not on good terms with, or at home with, themselves. The first effect of        self-acquaintance may not always be encouraging. We discover our        prejudices and our limitations of knowledge or capacity. But the        recognition of ignorance is, as Socrates maintained, the beginning of        wisdom; and the education which so begins may pass into the highest form        of education, which is the “conversation with a man’s best self “. And        this kind of self-knowledge and self-communion is bound up with a [page        7] better understanding of the other man and of the community in which        we live, so that the student who has come by it is like to be a better        parent, a better companion, and a better citizen.

<p>We do not seek nor expect perfection; we see frequent failures and        failings back; but all of us who are engaged in residential Adult        Education are encouraged to continue by the happy knowledge of men and        women whose lives have been enriched, if not transformed, by the gradual        process of growth in knowledge, wisdom, humour and good humour—of growth,        in fact, in grace.

<p>Educational Settlements        —Non-residential Colleges for Adult Education in normal areas

<p>Any attempt to describe a Settlement in a normal area        must overcome the difficulty of definition: what is a Settlement and what is a normal area? For the purpose of this article a normal        area must be understood as an urban area, neither “special” nor “distressed “, with a fair provision of community services such as        health, technical and post-school education in general. ‘What a Settlement        is in such an area will, I hope, be clear by the time this article is        concluded.

<p>It is always easy to say, first, what a thing is not, and therefore it may be as well to say how a Settlement differs from both a W.E.A. tutorial        class and a local authority’s evening institute. W.E.A. tutorial classes        will be found in Settlements, and some Settlements are affiliated to        evening institutes. Moreover, some institutes, especially those provided        by the London County Council, are the equal in range and social life, and        mote than the equal in equipment, of the best of Settlements. Where is the        difference?

<p>As is generally known, the principle of the W.E.A. is to form a        tutorial or other class where the members of the class require it, in        church hail, school, settlement or working men’s club. By contrast the        Settlement houses a variety of activities in the one building. On the        other side, however vivid may be the social life of a London Literary        Institute, its programme, staffing and general control are in the hands of        a statutory authority: the principal, for example, cannot be dismissed by the students. In a        Settlement, however, it is possible for the individual student, with [page        8] his or her fellows, to have a preponderating share in the government of        the Settlement, to appoint the staff, to decide the educational and        general policy and generally, through an executive, to be responsible for        the detailed life of a community which may include as many as six or seven        hundred men and women.

<p>So much for definition by contrast. Now, what would you find on        entering a Settlement? Inside on the notice board there would be the        schedule of the day’s, or more generally the evening’s, activities. These        might include an economics class, folk dancing, a rehearsal for a Shaw        play, German literature and practical wireless construction. The number of activities is necessarily determined by the        size and adequacy of the premises. From the entrance hall it is usually not far to the common room. This should be, and in most Settlements is,        truly a common room. It ceases to be one when rehearsals or committee        meetings are allowed to encroach. After classes are over the embryo        philosophers and folk dancers, economists and German scholars, together        with others not bent on any special activity, meet and talk there. A        canteen is provided, and tongues can wag, gently lubricated by tea, coffee        or lemonade, until 11 p.m., or whatever is the official closing time. A        library is housed either in the common room or elsewhere. For the rest,        the enquirer will find class rooms, a lecture hall and workshops, together        with, in many Settlements, the private rooms of the resident wardens.

<p>Much has been written of things so far. What is happening to persons.        here? Well, in the first case, there is space in the Settlement, colour        and light, and many who come there lack these in their homes. There is        freedom. In the Settlement the individual man or woman may become        significant. The man is no longer a lodger, tolerated by an inhospitable        landlady. The woman is no longer “merely a wife “—dare it be said?—surrounded by housework and the care of children. A good many young        parents take it in turn to come to the Settlement, in order that neither        shall be wholly tied.

<p>There is not only freedom; there is grace. You only achieve        significance by making yourself acceptable to your fellows. On first        joining the Settlement you may discover pain, the pain of contrast.        Settlements are not places to stave off revolution. But the discontent        stands a chance of becoming transformed through righteous indignation into        positive social effort by the fellowship of varied souls, whose experience may range from that of a county        court judge or city engineer to that of a coachbuilder or factory hand.        The intellectual discipline of the tutorial class is allowed to impress        the passive play-reader. Folk dances keep the earnest Marxist human, and        Christian and Atheist are able to meet together in a community which is        salted with humour. [page 9]

<p>Most of the work is done in the evening, but there is a considerable        and growing amount of work being done in the day with shift workers,        unemployed, and married women. It is not only classes which are organized.        In most Settlements there are strong dramatic groups; one has twice been        in the finals of the British Drama League for the whole of England.        Settlements have often taken a leading part in forming Youth Hostels, in        focusing public opinion on the school-leaving age, nursery schools and        other local government matters.

<p>All educational settlements are affiliated to the Educational        Settlements Association, which is a responsible body recognized by the        Board of Education. Classes submitted through the E.S.A. or the W.E.A. are        inspected by the Board’s inspectorate. In addition, many local authorities        give block grants to Settlements and a corresponding amount of        registration and inspection follows again.

<p>The majority of Settlements receive a grant from the E.S.A., ranging        from ten to thirty per cent, of the total income; the balance is made up        of students’ fees (in one Settlement these range from is. 6d. to 7s.,        according to the class, and the year’s entire programme may be taken for a        composition fee of 12s. 6d.), grants in aid from the Board of Education        and the local authority, local subscriptions, and the special efforts,        such as garden parties, of the students themselves.

<p>The staff will vary from place to place. There is always a full-time        Warden or joint Wardens, with occasionally a sub-Warden. The remainder are        part-time tutors, taking their special subjects. They may be wholly        occupied with similar work, as are the majority of W.E.A. tutorial class        tutors, or they may be engaged on quite other work. There is in one        Settlement, for example, a Post Office official who conducts an English        literature class which has achieved renown. Many groups, especially those        which are not limited by statutory requirements, will be staffed and        organized by students themselves.

<p>Cardinal Newman once wrote: “If, then, a practical end must be assigned        to a university course, I say it is that of training good members of        society. Its art is the art of social life and its end is fitness for the        world.” The Settlement is concerned not only with the decent use of        leisure but with the very art of living, and the words of Newman may not        unjustly be adopted as its aim.

<p> “ What I claim is liberal education: opportunity, that is, to have        my        share of whatever knowledge there is in the world according to my capacity        or bent of mind . . . and also to have my share of skill of band which is        about in the world, either in the industrial handicrafts or the fine        arts.”

<p>WILLIAM MORRIS.

<p>[page 10]

<p>In special areas

<p> “TheSettlements which have grown up in the mining valleys of South Wales since 1927 are making a contribution to the cultural and social life of the communities they serve which may fairly be described as unique inasmuch as they have been able to continue, in a way hardly open to any other type        of organisation, the provision of expert advisory services in a variety of        social activities with the maintenance of that close personal relationship        and concern for people in whose midst they are situated, which is the        distinguishing mark of Settlement work.”—Report of the Commissioner for        the Special Areas in England and Wales for the year ended September 30th,        1937.

<p>A number of palliative and practical efforts have been made in the        Special Areas in the hope of mitigating the severity and demoralization of        the conditions which poverty and uselessness have imposed upon many        thousands of homes. One of the most significant has been the establishment        of Educational Settlements of which there are eight in South Wales, one on        the north-east coast of County Durham, and one at Maryport in Cumberland.

<p>The first and obvious needs met by these efforts were physical. Visits        to the homes of some of the miners revealed the desperate struggle going        on, not only to feed the family, but in many cases also to hide the        poverty that had overtaken them. Steps were taken to meet such needs as        far as funds would allow.

<p>But if the physical condition was serious the mental condition was even        more serious, and there was as deep a need for an understanding sympathy        as for material help.

<p>In the situation we are thinking of the people had been used to work,        to a consuming occupation which demanded their physical strength and        occupied their minds, but after the General Strike many thousands of them        found themselves with nothing to do from morning to night, week in, week        out, and in place of a regular wage a meagre allowance from Public        Assistance. Next, therefore, to trying to meet the barest physical needs        was the imperative necessity [page 11] of something to meet the mental and spiritual demands of their lives,        and it was this which led to the first Settlement in South Wales.

<p>As an outcome of consultation with those who had experience of        Educational Settlements in normal areas a house, Maes-yr-Haf, was taken        and the experiment began of educating people to make good use of their        otherwise useless hours and days.

<p>At Maes-yr-Haf it was recognized from the outset that sympathy becomes        mere sentimentality unless it has a practical expression, and that the        spiritual life of a people is inseparably linked up with education in the        broadest sense of that word. Therefore an attempt was made to find work        for idle hands to do as well as to provide food for the mind. Cobblers’        shops, equipped with the necessary tools and leather, where unemployed men        could mend boots and shoes for their dependants and also for school        children, were among the first and successful efforts. Later came the        development of men’s clubs in which meals were provided and pieces of        public work undertaken by unemployed men, by arrangement with the local        authorities. The clubs had workshops and tools where men could learn to        make simple furniture and mend their own household necessities. Skilled        instructors were available, and at one time there were as many as forty        such centres in different parts of the South Wales valleys.

<p>The starting of Adult Schools, and informal classes in a variety of        subjects, and of a little school of weaving for women and girls at the        Maes-yr-Haf Settlement, opened the way to new friendships and wider        contacts. The weaving school was a great success and brought many women        and girls into touch with beautiful work.

<p>On the side of educational class work the Settlement provided competent        lecturers in subjects that were close to the people’s interests.’ Although        all the classes held, and they were many, were informal, the standard set        was a high one. Time has shown that this provision was in direct line with        the needs of the people, because the educational classes and lectures have        grown from 9 in 1927 to 78 classes and 420 single lectures in 1937, and        the students from about 200 in 1927 to over 1,000 in 1937. The Settlement        staff, which began with two, to-day consists of twenty-four, including        lecturers and instructors in Economics, Biology, Music, Psychology,        Handicrafts, Drama, Play Centres, Physical Training, and Recreation.

<p>This first experiment worked like leaven, and soon attempts were made        to adapt it to the needs of other areas. Following close upon its        found2tion was the opening of a Settlement at Merthyr Tydfil, and an        original piece of work was begun at Dowlais. A little later Oxford House,        Risca, was opened, and was followed by Bargoed Educational Settlement in 1934.        [page 12] In 1936 by one at Aberdare and another at Pontypool. Plans are in hand        for a further one at Pontypridd, which it is expected will be in full work        during this winter. In the North of England a new Settlement was opened in        Seaham Harbour in 1930, and the latest development is one at Maryport in        West Cumberland, opened on September 22nd, 1937.

<p>Of the development in South Wales Sir Percy Watkins, formerly of the        Board of Education, says: “Each Settlement serves its own area, usually a        mining valley with a population varying from 50,000 to 130,000, and from        this significant fact there has grown, perfectly naturally, a somewhat        unique result, namely that each Settlement is not merely a central meeting        place for its associated clubs and groups and individuals, but is also a        power-station from which emanates guidance and advice.... A South Wales        Settlement is therefore a natural unit of organization within its area for        any form of social service which depends for the value of its contribution upon a recognition of the cultural and social needs of that area as a        whole. . . . These focal points are institutions which in the midst of all        our changing social problems stand for something abiding and permanent and        stable...."

<p>An account of this kind would be incomplete unless some reference were        made to the wider movement throughout the country which has been made        possible by the Special Area Fund and the interest and sympathy of the        Special Commissioner, Sir P. Malcolm Stewart, and his successor, Sir        George M. Gillett. This fund, administered mainly through the National        Council of Social Service, has been used to try to meet the greater need        throughout the country and has been applied in a variety of ways and with        varying degrees of success. There is no question, however, that those who        were responsible for the administration of that fund availed themselves of        the ideas that were being worked out at Maes-yr-Haf and in other        Settlements.

<p>One thing must not be overlooked, and that is that the Educational        Settlement in Special Areas did not begin with any orthodox conception of        what a Settlement should be, but only with the intense desire to meet a        very serious and demoralizing human situation, and an open mind as to how        that could be done. There now seems little doubt that the thing was right        in its inception, and that the life of thousands of people has been        effectively reached.

<p>Moreover, as time has gone on and it has become more clear that a very        large section of the mining community will never return to the one        occupation of which they have competent knowledge, and that they will        never have the chance of beginning life anew in some other district or in some other occupation, the Settlement is        destined to play a permanent part in their lives.
