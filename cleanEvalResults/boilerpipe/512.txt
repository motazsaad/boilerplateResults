<h>FCBPW MISSION

<p>Providing opportunities for women in the workplace to come     together for bible-based worship, fellowship, discipleship, and     encouragement, advancing the spread of the gospel for the Glory of     God.  

<p>FCBPW VISION

<p>Reaching and inspiring women in workplaces everywhere to know the love of Christ and grow in grace and the knowledge of God.

<p>Bringing women together to build relationships; teaching, encouraging, and equipping them for works of service to the building up of the body of Christ.

<p>All this for the glory of God!

<p>We believe the Bible is the inspired and inerrant Word of God.

<p>We believe in one God; Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

<p>We believe that we are saved by grace through faith and that is not of     ourselves, it is the gift of God.

<p>We believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that he died for our sins and     was raised from the dead, and that whoever believes in Him will have     everlasting life.
