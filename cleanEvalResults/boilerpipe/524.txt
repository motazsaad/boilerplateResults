<p>Precision                  Instruments for accomplished Engineers

<p>Quality of workmanship, field engineering                  and system performance are determined by the skills and expertise                  of the engineer but no engineer can perform precision works without                  precision instruments. The course will also cover the following                  instruments:

<p>UnaOhm SBM105C Satellite Analog Digital                  Signal Analyser

<p>The SBM105 analyses the quality of satellite                  receive signals and offers all measurements required by digital                  communication channels. Is also offers level measurement of analog                  signals as well as spectral analysis of the band.

<p>SMARTTool

<p>Precision level meter for setting and                  alignment of antenna to ensure optimum signal strength and maximum                  system reliability.

<p>SUUNTO Bearing Compass & Clinometer

<p>The Suunto Tandem is a liquid-filled                  precision compass and clinometer in one compact aluminum housing                  that is easy to use and rugged enough to protect against impact,                  corrosion and water.
