<p>A BRIEF HISTORY OF JUMP FOR THE CAUSE

<p>Jump For The Cause's first event was in 1997, and raised over $11,000 for a local Battered Women's Shelter.  The event was 1-day only, and involved 48 jumpers who formed a Star of David in freefall.   The second event took place in 1998 and was also a Star of David Jump.  This event raised almost $20,000 to benefit battered Women and Children.

<p>JUMP RUN PRODUCTIONS and SQUARE ONE PARACHUTE SALES incorporated JUMP FOR THE CAUSE Inc., in 1999.

<p>The 1999 Women's World Record Skydive was the new corporation's flagship event. This 6-day event raised over $300,000 to fight breast cancer, and set a new World Record (118 Women)!

<p>Jump For The Cause's fourth event took place in 2000.  At this one-day event, 35 jumpers joined paraplegic jumper, Coral Degagne, to set a new World Tandem Record. Concurrent with this event, Skydive Dallas held their Texas State Record Attempts as a fundraiser to benefit JUMP FOR THE CAUSE.  The two events raised $55,000 for The USC Department of Neurology to help find a cure for Spinal Cord Research.

<p>In October of 2002, Jump For The Cause will present JUMP FOR THE CAUSE, 2002 - A WOMENS WORLD RECORD EVENT.  The event takes place October 14-19, at Perris Valley Skydiving. We plan to build a formation of 150 women, and our goal is to raise a quarter of a millon dollars for the City of Hope.
