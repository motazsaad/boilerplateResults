<p>Spring Bling! - Comments (1)

<p>My buddies have a little non-profit fundraising group called Debauchery for Donations and theyíre pulling together a great benefit party this weekend call Spring Bling to benefit Big Bam ; an organization that provides medical services to women who experience age, financial or cultural barriers that prevent detection and treatment of breast cancer. Team Debauchery (Aaron Crossley, Bixby Jamison, Dana Pauls, David Dolby, George Hume, Jessica Sterling, Jim Black, and Lisa Ludwig)  is known for having some of best events in the City and you should come check it out.

<p>The party will take place on Saturday, May 22nd and will feature live music from one of the Bay Areaís hottest tribute bands - STUNG! , the ultimate tribute to the POLICE. Followed by hip hop beats spun on two turntables and a microphone.

<p>Iíll be thereÖ and if youíre lucky Iíll be wearing this!

<p>This is not a politcal blog or activism website. I donít have an agenda, but I do have a problem with the way we are running our international affairs. Specifically, I think we are loosing the war in Iraq.

<p>America hasnít made friends of the Iraqi people.

<p>In the poll, 80 percent of the Iraqis questioned reported a lack of confidence in the Coalition Provisional Authority, and 82 percent said they disapprove of the U.S. and allied militaries in Iraq. ( Salt Lake Tribune , May 13)

<p>Bremer, and the Iraqi Governing Council have failed and their jobs will be turned over to the UN if itís a mission they choose to accept.

<p>ìWe sit in the council while the country is burning and argue over procedure,'í says Sheikh Yawar, a Sunni tribal leader who lived abroad until last year. ìWeíre like the Byzantines in Constantinople, debating whether angels are male or female with the barbarians at the gate.î Under Mr. Brahimiís plan for a transitional government, all 25 members of the US-appointed council would be culled in favor of a team of technocrats to be chosen next month by Brahimiís team and influential Iraqis, with US input. The group would take power in July and shepherd Iraq to elections next January - in which, ideally, they would not participate. ( Christian Science Monitor , May 13)

<p>The coalition is a sham and is falling apart.

<p>The war is expensive, bloody, and indefinite.

<p>The official, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz, acknowledged that a surge of violence and other problems in Iraq had led to rising costs, with no certainty yet when they would fall. ( NY Times, May 13 )

<p>The world is less safe than it was before we started, and there are more terrorists now than ever.

<p>The AP-Ipsos poll, released Wednesday at The Associated Press annual meeting, found: Half feel that, in some measure, the terrorists might be winning the war on terrorism. One in five in the poll feels strongly the terrorists are winning while an additional 30 percent say there is at least ‚Äúa little truth‚Äù to that statement.

<p>More than one-third say they have less faith in government‚Äôs ability to protect them, and an additional one-fourth say there‚Äôs at least some truth to that idea.

<p>Nearly half feel strongly they are more pessimistic about the possibility of there ever being peace in the world while an additional one-fourth say there may be some truth to that. ( MSNBC , April 22)

<p>More than 50% of Americaís troops are deployed, reservists tours are extended again, and the military is stretched thin.

<p>The US has committed most of its heavy ground forces and deployable aircraft carriers, as well as a large share of its best attack aircraft and air- and sea-lift units. ( Washington Post , April

<p>The newly announced troop extensions ‚Äî which broke the Pentagonís promise that Iraq tours of duty would be limited to one year ‚Äî are forcing many to change plans, cancel weddings and delay return to normal life. Meanwhile, the anxiety felt by those at home increases each day. ( ABS News , April 23)

<p>America has failed to uncover the weapons that led us into this war.

<p>During the annual Radio and Television Correspondents Dinner this week, Bush presented a slide show of quirky photographs from inside the White House. In one, the president is looking under furniture in the Oval Office. ìThose weapons of mass destruction have got to be somewhere,î Bush joked. ìNope, no weapons over there Ö maybe under here?î ( CNN, May 6th )

<p>Gmail, Plaxo, and LinkedIn - Comments (2)

<p>Google launched a cool new service called Gmail . Iíve landed a beta account and it seems pretty hot. You get 1000megs of space vs. MSN Hotmails 2megs making it an actually useful mailbox. Itís pretty interesting how it turns back and forth barrage of short emails into threads or ëconversationsí. It also takes advantage of Google search technology to keep my email life organized. Iíve set up my kk@burnkit.com address to forward there. Gmail would be really cool though if you could POP several accounts like you can over at Hotmail where I had been popping my old TWU mail, my Burnkit mail, and my groovy.com mail. Anyway, Iím hooked. Checked it out when it becomes generally available.

<p>Iíve also been expiramenting with this other online networking tool called LinkedIn . I got turned onto it from a good friend, Ean Jackson , in Vancouver who always seems to be on the cutting edge of this type of thingÖ he got me up and running on Plaxo too. It kinda seems like Friendster but for business contacts. You upload information about yourself and your professional experience and jobs youíve held. People who have worked with you in the past can write testimonials or references. Itís kinda fun to mess with and a good way to ëpracticeí marketing oneself, but Iím still skeptical that Iíll get any good job leads or new contacts from itÖ weíll see. Lemme know if any of you guys sign up and Iíll write you up a little reference and beg you for one for me as well.
