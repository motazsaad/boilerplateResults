<p>Q: What is the Fair Housing Act?

<p>A: The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, familial status, or disability by housing providers.

<p>Q: How does the Department of Justice enforce the Fair Housing Act?

<p>A: Under the Fair Housing Act, the Department of Justice may start a lawsuit where it has reason to believe that a person or entity is engaged in a "pattern or practice" of discrimination, or where a denial of rights to a group of persons raises an issue of general public importance. Through these lawsuits, the Department can obtain money damages, both actual and punitive damages, for those individuals harmed by a defendant's discriminatory actions, as well as prevent any further discriminatory conduct. The violator may also be required to pay money penalties to the United States.

<p>The Department of Housing and Urban Development [“HUD”] investigates individual cases of discrimination in housing. If HUD determines that reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred, then either the person complaining or the person against whom the complaint was filed may elect to have the case heard in federal court. In those instances, the Department of Justice will bring the case on behalf of the individual complainant. In addition, where force or a threat of force is used to deny or interfere with fair housing rights, the Department of Justice may begin criminal proceedings.

<p>Finally, in cases involving discrimination in home mortgage loans or home improvement loans, the Department may file suit under both the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.

<p>Q: What do I do if I believe I’ve been the victim of illegal discrimination in housing?

<p>Q: Does the Fair Housing Act prohibit discrimination on the basis of a person's sexual orientation?

<p>A: When sexual orientation is the only basis of discrimination, no. However, these complaints are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether any other form of discrimination is present (such as sex or disability, for example).

<p>Many state and local laws prohibit discrimination in housing based on sexual orientation. You should consult with your local or state civil rights enforcement agency to determine whether discrimination on this basis is protected.
