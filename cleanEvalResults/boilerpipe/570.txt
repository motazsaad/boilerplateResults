<p>Bank of Wisdom CD-ROM's

<p>Metroplex Atheists is an outlet for the Emmett               Fields Bank of Wisdom CD-ROM collection. These are collections of obscure atheist               literature available on CD-ROM for low prices. Many of these works               are very obscure and are only available publicly in these               collections. The pictured Robert Ingersoll CD, for example,               contains the entire 12-volume Dresden Edition collection of his               speeches and writings. This collection would cost over $1000 if               purchased on paper, but you can get it on CD-ROM for around $25.

<p>Book Covers And, of course, we sell the infamous         book covers that caused Pat Robertson to blow a gasket on the set of The         700 Club . We also ship covers out if you live outside of D/FW.         You can order them here .
