<p>Baroness Greenfield appears in Parliament what account they are taking of the impact of fast-moving advances in science and technology on how young people think and learn in planning future education policy. She draws the attention to the opportunities  that come with the application of science in children's education.:"There is no doubt that with an understanding of how learning occurs, some wonderful technologies exist to help us to realize our full potential, but applying the technologies in inappropriate ways may be changing the very way in which our children think."

<p>MindWeavers attends The Association of Speech and Language Therapists in Independent Practice AGM and Study Day 2006.

<p>MindWeavers consulted as part of Jim Rose’s Review of Reading Report  “Independent review of the teaching of early reading” (DfES) carried out in March 2006 as an indication of the increasing importance of the understanding of how the brain learns language and how we can use this knowledge to benefit our children.

<p>MSE Trial results announced in MindWeavers' Press Release.

<p>July 2003

<p>MW commence development of English as an Additional Language (EAL) field trial programme with remote language learning partner.

<p>June 2003

<p>MSE trial results show Phonomena training 'PhAB' average age-equivalent increases of 2.4 years after just 4 weeks training.

<p>When re-tested 6 weeks after training, a further 0.6 years increase. This shows Phonomena develops the learner's own resources (trains the senses) so that improvement continues after the training has been completed, not only in the listening skills that have been practised, but also in standard tests of hearing and speech.

<p>June 2003

<p>Phonomena first set of field trial results from SLTs announced in MindWeavers' Press Release.

<p>May 2003

<p>Preliminary trial results show dramatic improvements in measures of reading abilities

<p>February 2003

<p>Identify & recruit mainstream school for field trials

<p>November 2002

<p>MW engage with education sector to design mainstream school field trial program for 8-9 year-old children of normal abilities.

<p>Using industry recognised performance measures of receptive language - the NFER Nelson 'Phonics Assessment Battery' (PhAB) test.

<p>August 2002 

<p>Flagship Speech and Language Therapists trials show age equivalent improvement of 1.8 years in word listening ability.

<p>In a smaller trial in Special Schools, an age improvement of 1.2 years was found. These improvements are dramatic, and compare more than favourably with other commercial trials of language training software designed for perceptual learning. They prove the effectiveness of Phonomena Training in building listening skills that are essential for normal language.

<p>May 2002

<p>Field trials of Phonomena start.

<p>Trial groups are: Speech Language Therapists, Special Schools, Mainstream Schools, English as a Second Language Schools, and Parents.

<p>International meeting of the Society for Neuroscience.

<p>Attended by many of the top neuroscientists from across the world, showed the positive influence of auditory training on brain activity. A number of presentations highlighted the amazing ability of the brain to adapt to changed circumstances and to respond to the demands of a task, even in the elderly. These results strongly endorse the MindWeavers approach of using intensive training near the 'edge of competence'.
