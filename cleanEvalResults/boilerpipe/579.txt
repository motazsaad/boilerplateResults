<p>B-2 as a  "non-spouse partner" (gender does not matter), if you are a "partner" of  a E, H, or L visa holder.  (See below.)

<p>B  Nonimmigrant Visa

<p>B-1:  For individuals visiting temporary for "business", i.e., engaging in commercial  transactions such as attending conferences, business meetings, executing  contracts, undertaking negotiations.  Can not be "gainfully employed"  in the U.S.; payment/salary to B-1 nonimmigrant should be made abroad.  The B-1 or B-2 visa holders are normally allowed into the U.S. for a 6-month  period.

<p>Note:

<p>Must have financial support and intent  to depart.  Additionally, some port-of-entry offices (Western Region)  may disqualify admission of a B-1 nonimmigrant (or corresponding Visa Waiver  Program nonimmigrant [see below]) if the foreign national is entering the  United States and will be:  a) compensated from a U.S. source (beyond  reimbursement for expenses or per diem), or b) even if uncompensated, perform  services for which a U.S. worker would have to be hired or are the services  inherently part of the U.S. labor market, or c) services primarily benefiting  the U.S. entity as local work or hire as contrasted with benefiting the  foreign national him/herself or the foreign employer in furtherance of  international trade).

<p>B-2:  For individuals visiting temporary for "pleasure", i.e., engaging in tourism,  visiting relatives, attending conventions, language students (less than  18 hours a week).  The B-1 or B-2 visa holders are normally allowed  into the U.S. for a 6-month period.  Spouses and dependents of a nonimmigrant  visa, such as H-1B, are eligible for an H-4.  However, "cohabitating  partners", who are not spouses or dependents, can apply for the B-2 visa.

<p>Note:

<p>Must have financial support and intent  to depart.

<p>Cohabitating Partners:

<p>The Department of State (DOS) has issued  guidance that emphasize that "cohabitating partners" may apply for the  B-2 nonimmigrant visa.  "Cohabitating Partner" means individuals who  are not spouses or dependents, but who have lived/resided on a long-term  basis, with the principle visa holder.  The DOS states that this is  true for "both opposite and same-sex partners."  (Note:  The individual, however, must overcome INA 214(b).)

<p>Medical Treatment:

<p>The VSC (US CIS) indicates that while  there are is maximum duration of status for B-2 holders who are receiving  medical treatment , or accompanying an individual who is receiving medical  treatment.  However, any period over one year will be subject to scrutiny,  because the US CIS may make a determination that the B-2 visa holder may  have immigrant intent (intent to reside permanently in the U.S., which  is contrary to the "temporary/nonimmigrant" nature of the B-2 visa).  With respect to medical treatment related B-2 visas, the duration of status  can be longer than a year if sufficient evidence of the need for medical  treatment and  ability to financially fund the treatment are presented.  For Medical Treatment B-2s, it is important to prove that there is no U.S.  government financing for medical expenses (however, the patient can receive  donations from a local church or other non-profit organization that is  offering support).

<p>VWP (Visa Waiver  Program):

<p>An individuals does not need a B-1 or  B-2 visa if they can use the VWP (Visa Waiver Program) for travel to the  United States for less than 3 months.  Those who require the B-2 visa  because VWP is unavailable, or because the duration is more than 3 months,  normally are given a 6-month period of B-1/B-2 stay in the United States.  Once in the U.S., extensions are possible, but too many may be considered  as not "temporary."  However, the Department of State has issued guidance  stating that:  "the fact that the period of stay in a given case may  exceed six months or a year is not in itself controlling, provided the  consular officer is satisfied that the intended stay actually has a time  limitation and is not indefinite in nature."

<p>(See Visa  Waiver Program (VWP) .)

<p>Changes to B-1/B-2  Visas (Affecting Intended F & M Students):

<p>On April 12, 2002, the US CIS published new rules imposing new restrictions on B-1/B-2  visitors and those who seek to obtain student visas (after entering the  U.S. using a B-1/B-2 visa).

<p>Interim  Rule: Prohibition on Attending School Prior to Change of Status from B-1/B-2  to F-1 or M-1

<p>Before the interim rule, visitors admitted  under B-1/B-2 visas were allowed to begin attending school before the US  CIS approved their request to change status to F-1 or M-1 students.  The interim rule does not eliminate the ability of B-1/B-2 visitors to  change their status to F-1 or M-1 students.  However, it prohibits  B-1/B-2 visitors from attending school without first obtaining US  CIS approval.  The US CIS is instituting  this change as a direct result of the terrorist attacks of September 11.

<p>Proposed Rule:  New Requirements for Change of Status from B-1/B-2 to F-1 or M-1

<p>In addition to the interim rule, the US  CIS issued a proposed rule that requires B-1/B-2 visitors to notify  the US CIS of their intent to attend school  in the U.S. when they initially enter the US as B-1/B-2 visitors. Furthermore,  if they have already received any I-20 forms from schools, they must produce  the forms to the inspecting officers at the time of admission.  Inspecting  officers will make the proper notification on I-94 Entry/Departure card  that the B-1/B-2 visitors are prospective students.

<p>(See M-1  Student Visa .)

<p>Proposed Rule:  Minimum Admission Period Eliminated

<p>Currently, visitors admitted under B-1/B-2  visas are routinely granted a 6-month period of admission, regardless of  the time they actually intend to stay in the United States.  The proposed  rule will eliminate the automatic 6-month admission period for B-2 visitors,  and only provide a period of time that is necessary as explained by the  visitor.  If B-2 visitors cannot explain to the satisfaction of the  inspecting officers, they will be granted a 30-day period of admission  only.  If B-2 visitors can establish the need for a period of stay  longer than 30 days, an appropriate period of admission will be granted  up to 6 months.

<p>Proposed Rule:  Maximum Period of Admission Reduced

<p>The US CIS is  also proposing to reduce the maximum period of admission for B-1/B-2 visitors  from 1 year to 6 months.

<p>Proposed Rule:  Changes to Standards for Extension of Stay

<p>The maximum period for each extension  of stay application will remain 6 months for B-1/B-2 visitors.  However,  the proposed rule will limit the conditions under which B-1/B-2 visitors  can request an extension of stay.  B-1/B-2 visitors will be eligible  for an extension of stay only in cases that have resulted from unexpected  or compelling humanitarian reasons.  In addition, they must prove  that they have adequate financial resources to support their stay in the  U.S. and that they are maintaining a residency abroad which they have no  intention of abandoning.

<p>VWP  (Visa Waiver Program)

<p>This is  NOT a visa (no change of status, no extension of stay allowed), but is  issued for those individuals with B-1 or B-2 intent, and who wishes to  enter the U.S. for less than three (3) months.  You must be a national  of a qualifying country (individuals who are ineligible for VWP, or those  who require US stays of more than 3 months, may seek the B-1/B-2).

<p>Note:

<p>Must have return-ticket out of the U.S.  There is no need to apply for visa "sticker" issuance from the US  CIS, or visa "sticker" from the U.S. Consulate/Embassy.

<p> 

<p>8September  25, 20038 MRP  (machine-readable passport) Requirement Postponed for 21 Countries

<p>The Dept. of State (with the Dept. of  Homeland Security) has officially announced the postponement of the MRP  requirement (see below) for "visa waiver (VWP)" travelers for nationals  of 21 countries:  Australia, Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,  Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,  Portugal, San Marino, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United  Kingdom.

<p>Nationals of other countries wishing to  visit the U.S. must either have a MRP for "visa waiver (VWP)" entry (if  qualifying country), or a visa.

<p>8June  16, 20038 Entry & Departure:  Machine-Readable Passport Required for Visa Waiver  Program (VWP)

<p>Under the Visa Waiver  Program (VWP), the citizens of certain countries may visit the U.S. for  business or pleasure for up to 90 days without a visa "sticker."  Effective October 01, 2003,  all travelers who wish to travel to the U.S. under the Visa Waiver Program  (VWP) must possess a machine-readable passport (MRP) issued by their government  and present it at the U.S. port of entry. Those who do not possess such  a passport must apply for a nonimmigrant visa (such as an B-1/2) at the  U.S. Embassy/Consulate (Dept. of State) prior to traveling to the United  States.

<p>Visa Waiver Program  (VWP) countries:  Andorra, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brunei, Denmark,  Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein,  Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, San  Marino, Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom  and Uruguay. (The list changes occasionally; please check the Department  of State website for updated lists.)

<p>Also:  If  you enter the U.S. under this program, you cannot extend your stay past  90 days except for very limited circumstances, and you cannot change to  another nonimmigrant status while in the United States. In addition, you  cannot adjust status unless an immigrant petition is based on an immediate  relative relationship. Therefore, if you are a citizen of a qualified country  but plan to stay past 90 days or to change your status in the U.S, you  may want to consider obtaining a nonimmigrant visa such as B-1 or B-2.

<p>Also:  Citizens  of Belgium who wish to travel to the U.S. under the Visa Waiver Program  must possess a machine-readable passport issued by the Government of Belgium  effective May 15, 2003. Otherwise, they are required to apply for a nonimmigrant  visa prior to traveling to the United States.

<p>Strategic  Difference:  B-1/B-2 and Visa Waiver Program

<p>The B-1 or B-2 allows individuals to extend  the stay in the U.S. (by filing an extension) or to change status (to an  F-1, L-1, etc.).  VWP holders, because it is not a visa, cannot file  an extension nor change status.  In the past, individuals seeking  to attend school, but could not apply for an F-1 student visa, entered  the U.S. on a B visa, first.  Business people who wanted to start  a business also entered the U.S. on a B visa to begin initial preparations.
