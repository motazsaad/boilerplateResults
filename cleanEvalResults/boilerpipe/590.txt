<h>Swampscott, MA. 01907

<p>The following information summarizes the history leading up to this action:

<p>The Massachusetts Education Reform Act of 1993 amended the teacher certification act to include school  nurses.  The position of "school nurse" in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is now defined by statute.  Despite the  fact that since June 1993 school nurse certification requirements are equal to, and in some areas even more rigorous  than, those for teachers and other non-classroom based educational support personnel, most professional school nurses  in Massachusetts are denied compensation equal to other professionals employed by the school system.

<p>It is MSNO's contention that the practice of salary inequities ultimately impacts the quality of health care  delivered to students, since it is difficult  to attract and retain school nurses with expertise in critical thinking,  decision making, program management, health education and counseling, program planning, and community outreach, when  competitive salaries are not offered.

<p>Groups of nurses in individual school systems have historically had little success in securing equitable  contracts.   Despite the current statewide and national recognition of the positive impact  of school nurses on children's health,  the expanded public health role of school nurses, and the need for their professional education, many of Massachusetts'  school nurses report that they continue to feel undervalued, unempowered, and isolated.  In spite of their many  attempts to campaign for adequate compensation, comparable to other professionals  in the school system, they have  continuously been denied pay equity.

<p>Consequently in September 1997 the Massachusetts  School Nurse Organization (MSNO) formed a "Pay Equity Committee"  and began a statewide effort to address  the problem of school nurse salary inequities.

<p>In January 1998 MSNO conducted a statewide survey that confirmed that only a small minority of the school districts in  the Commonwealth pay school nurses on the same pay scale as their professional counterparts with equal educational and  certification requirements. (The survey report, entitled Report  on the Current State of Salary Inequities for  Professional School Nurses in Massachusetts, is available from MSNO.) The vast majority of school nurses in  Massachusetts  are significantly under-compensated.

<p>In November 1999 a complaint was filed in Essex County Superior Court.  Plaintiffs were Ann Greenbaum, RN and Roberta  Cobbett, RN, school nurses  in the Swampscott Public Schools.  Defendants were the Chairman of the Swampscott School  Committee, the Superintendent of the Swampscott School Department and the duly elected Swampscott School Committee.

<p>On July 25, 2000 a lawsuit was filed in Suffolk County Superior Court by Attorney Neil Rossman, Civil  Action No.  #00-3348-F.

<p>School Nurse Pay Equity Lawsuit

<p>(November 2000)

<p>Submitted by Barbara Connolly

<p>The Massachusetts Attorney General's office is representing the Department of Education in the matter  of the Pay Equity lawsuit.  The Assistant Attorney General for Administrative Law is filing a "Motion to Dismiss" and has submitted this motion to MSNO's attorney, Neil Rossman.  Attorney Rossman will submit a response to this motion.   It will be the "Opposition of Plaintiffs to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss." The Motion to Dismiss and the  response will then be filed with the court and will be reviewed by a judge.  We will keep you updated on this website as  the legal proceedings unfold.

<p>Newspapers across the state remain interested in doing articles on school nurses generally and on the pay equity  issue in particular.  Journalists are very willing to pay attention to nurses.  A recently published book entitled From Silence to Voice: What Nurses Know and Must Communicate to the Public by Bernice Buresh and Suzanne Gordon  presents a practical guide that provides approaches to increase nurses' visibility and voice in the media.  We have  found during this campaign for pay equity that the media is very interested in our issues.  Do not be intimidated.   Contact your local newspapers and cable stations to publicize the pay equity issue.  We need to be heard and each of  you can make a difference in your area.  Please feel free to contact  Barbara Connolly at her msno.org e-mail address or cobbett@msno.org with questions.

<p>On October 26, 2000 The New Bedford Standard-Times ran an article entitled "School Nurses Keep Busy"  in which they featured the nurses in the Freetown/Lakeville School District.

<p>The South Weekly edition of The Boston Globe on Sunday October 8, 2000 carried a feature article  entitled "School Nurses Demand More Pay." Nurses from Duxbury, Hanover and Freetown/Lakeville were spotlighted.   On October 22, 2000 The Boston Globe published the following letter-to-the-editor, submitted by Barbara  Connolly on behalf of MSNO, in response to comments made in the article by Hanover's superintendent of schools.

<p>Pay Equity for School Nurses

<p>(Letter-to-the Editor)

<p>A book published in 1989 entitled Just a Nurse stated that "the public wants a nurse to be a warm,  caring human being.  The intellectual acumen needed to practice professional nursing is rarely understood." This  statement applies to school superintendents and school committees who rarely seem to recognize the role of school nurses  and certainly do not seem to understand the "intellectual acumen" required of these nurses.

<p>The practice of professional nursing by school nurses occurs within the complex and unpredictable setting of the  educational institution, not in a medical facility.  A school nurse usually functions as a sole practitioner in her  school. The Comprehensive School Health Manual, published by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health in  1995, reminds us that the comprehensive and expanding public health nature of school nursing practice demands an  educational and skill level that enables the school nurse to meet the current health needs of the students and staff.   Why then, do the majority of school districts in the Commonwealth continue to devalue the nursing profession by refusing  to pay nurses on the same salary scale as teachers and other non-classroom based educational  support staff?

<p>It is the Massachusetts School Nurse Organization's contention that the practice of salary inequities ultimately  impacts the quality of health care delivered to students, since it is difficult to attract and retain school nurses with  expertise in critical thinking, decision making, program management, health education and counseling, program planning,  and community outreach, when competitive salaries are not offered.

<p>Pay Equity for School Nurses

<p>Barbara Connolly, RN, MSN

<p>Pay Equity Chairperson

<p>It appears that school districts which deny school nurses pay equity are violating the Education Reform Act's  statement of nondiscrimination.  A summary of the issues in the lawsuit are as follows:

<p>under the Education Reform Act school nurses are required to be certified like all other educational professionals  and to have a bachelor's degree as a prerequisite to certification...

<p>school nurses are professional educators, as are all other non-classroom based educational support staff...

<p>under Education Reform school nurses are the legal equal of other certified educators...

<p>in spite of having to meet the same requirements as classroom teachers pay equity and professional standing are  denied the school nurses...

<p>salary schedules for school nurses are much lower than all other educational professionals...

<p>Also, the Education Reform Act states (Section 99 of Statutes of 1993, Chapter 71):

<p>"All programs and actions  undertaken under the provisions of this act shall be conducted in a manner reflecting  and encouraging a policy of nondiscrimination and equal opportunity for members of minority groups and women.  All  officials...of any school department...shall take affirmative steps to ensure equality of opportunity in the internal  affairs of such departments...Each school district department...shall adopt measures to ensure equal opportunity  in the  areas of hiring, promotion,...rates of compensation and in-service training programs..."

<p>The MSNO Board of Directors has voted to support this legal action to achieve pay equity for school nurses.   More information will be forthcoming to every school nurse in the State regarding how they can lend their encouragement   and financial support to this undertaking.

<p>MSNO Advances with Pay Equity Legal Action

<p>The MSNO Pay Equity Committee wishes to thank all who have contributed to the MSNO Legal Action Fund.   In the short time since

<p>we have informed our  membership and other school nurse colleagues of our legal action process and our need for funding this action,  we have raised $17,000. The requested amount to contribute is $50.  Individual school nurses' contributions have  ranged from $25 to $1,000.  We thank you profoundly!  Since we anticipate needing $50,000, we hope that those who  have not yet contributed will do so soon. Everyone's contribution is necessary if this legal action is to  succeed.

<p>We have had a wonderful show of support from local unions, with donations ranging from $50 to $500!  The MTA  has been contacted by Linda Salmonsen, requesting that MTA contribute financially, as well as to encourage  the support of the individual locals.  NASN's Legal Defense Fund and the Connecticut Association of School Nurses  have also been most generous in contributing to our legal action.

<p>With the filing of this legal suit, the MSNO Pay Equity Committee will post various sample letters that school  nurses may use to request contributions from their local unions and/or friends of school nursing-either private  individuals or organizations which have supported school nurses and school health services.

<p>We will keep you posted as this legal action progresses.

<p>Honor Roll of Contributing Locals

<p>Several local unions have made generous contributions to the MSNO Legal Action Fund, such as Lanesborough, Dighton-Rehoboth, Brookline, Hanover, Westford and Central Berkshire.  Ask your local if they have contributed.  Show them the information on this website or in your newsletter which describes the Pay Equity lawsuit.  Ask them to make a contribution to show their support financially.  We are planning   an "Honor Roll  of Contributing Locals" to show our appreciation for their support  for this legal action and for their school nurses.
