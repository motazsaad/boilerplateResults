<p>If you've already customized the Java perspective, Eclipse won't respect our code's request to add the MyEclipse menu items.  You can add them manually by selecting all the MyEclipse options under Window->Customize Perspective->Other->MyEclipse*.

<p>Actually, I found a post about this and was able to use the post after I submitted this message.  If someone could put this stuff in a searchable place, you would not have to answer it multiple times.

<p>Creating a web project for standalone Ovacle (OC4J) has an assumed structure that is different from JBoss (at least). The project template from J2EE in Myeclipse should be on the Server level (in my opinion) since the various app servers have such widely varying forms.

<p>Quote:

<p>Actually, the forms don't vary that much.  They all support WAR, EJB jar, and EAR formats in either an exploded or archive form.  JBoss is odd because it expects that exploded directories are suffixed with a .war or .ear or whatever.  However, we have compensated for this in the next release of Enterprise Workbench, which will be available on 6/23.  As far as custom descriptors go, we are rapidly moving in the direction of creating basic server-specific descriptors.  At present, this would best be handled as an enhancement request since we'll already honor any custom descriptors that you've written.

<p>Oracle wants an application.xml file in a META-INF at the top of the project.  It seems that JBoss is quite insistent on its jboss-xxx.xml (Oracle does not have that sort of thing).  My real goal is to have a project that I can decide to test and deploy to multiple servers.  I think the spec is close to that kind of capability.  This kind of capability would put myeclipse head and shoulders above any other J2EE environment.  I will put something in enhancement request.

<p>Shutdown does not work for Oracle. I can do it with admin.jar (so it is not horrible), but it is annoying to have to do it. both userid and password are required to propeerly shutdown using admin.jar from Oracle.

<p>Quote:

<p>True.  And the userid of 'admin' and the password you set in the configuration dialog are passed to Oracle for shutdown.  This works quite well in the default installation configuration.  I assume you set a different administrator account than the default?  Would you like to propose an enhancement request that we also allow configuration of the admin account user name?

<p>I did not change the account from admin.  It just did not work.  When I could not make it work, I did change the password to something (the default in the Oracle download is "" and so I actually put something there and set it in the server dialog in myecliipse, but to no avail.

<p>Even if this stuff can't get in to the upcoming release, someone should spend a couple of hours writing something beyond the tiny bit that is written here. There is virtually nothing written about Oracle.

<p>Quote:

<p>We certainly agree.  However, since the software is in an Early Adopter release state, the documentation is very incomplete since we've concentrated on features over documentation at this pont.  Documentation will be one of the areas of concentration between EA2 and GA.  By the way, if you'd like to help out and write an Oracle tutorial, we'd be more than happy to incorporate it into the documentation.  Our consulting practice doesn't use Oracle 9i/AS that much so a tutorial from an expert would really be useful.

<p>I certainly do not, by these comments, mean to denigrate the effort you have put in here.  I am very pleased and encouraged.  This is a fine piece of work that IBM or Oracle or BEA would charge thousands for with much  less capability (especially for multiple deployments).  Thank you for this effort and for its afforability.
