<h>MST Standard #2- Information Systems

<p>MST Standard #3- Mathematics

<p>MST Standard #6- Interconnectedness: Common Themes

<p>Objectives:

<p>The students will use the Internet to look up various weather sites and choose the most appropriate one.

<p>The students will successfully navigate through a web site using links to obtain specific information.

<p>The students will learn how to bookmark and retrieve a particular site.

<p>The students will locate and record the temperature of a given area and then compare that temperature with the temperature of another area to determine which is warmer or colder.

<p>The students will color a thermometer to match the recorded temperature.

<p>In order for the students to succeed in this learning experience they must have some prior knowledge. They must show some competency with the following skills:

<p>Telling temperature to the nearest degree (Celsius or Fahrenheit)

<p>Understanding of negative temperature readings

<p>Locating different regions on a map and understanding that these regions have different climates

<p>Procedure:

<p>Present the class with a whole group lesson on how to use the Internet to locate a specific web site and then determine if it provides the necessary information. Guide the class through the process of bookmarking the site.

<p>Pair up the students. Whenever an opportunity arises (we did this first thing in the morning) allow the partners to access the web site and record the temperature for their town, as well as the temperature in an area of Antarctica (we used Vostok). The information can be recorded on the attached sheet.

<p>The students must then compare the two recorded temperatures and determine which area is experiencing colder weather. This is also recorded on the data sheet.

<p>Finally, the students will color in a thermometer to visually display the temperature.

<p>Instructional/Environmental Modifications:

<p>In order to do a whole group lesson on using the Internet, I took my class to the computer lab so that each student could have a computer in front of him/her. If you have access to the Internet through a computer in the classroom, then that computer could be used along with a LCD or video projector.

<p>The hearing impaired student in my class had no problems with this lesson since use of the computer headphones was not required. For visually impaired students, the teacher may want to consider the use of transparent, colored, highlighter tape. This tape can be placed directly on the monitor screen to highlight the information the students are locating.

<p> 

<p>Time Required:

<p>This learning experience was implemented with the help of a student teacher who was a great deal more computer literate than I was at the time. She spent about an hour locating weather web sites and scanning through them to see which one would provide us with the appropriate information. She then spent about a half an hour teaching me how to get into the web sites and how to bookmark them.

<p>This experience took about two weeks to finish. Each morning my student teacher took two children to the classroom next door to access the web sites, and record the information. They then returned to our room to make comparisons, color in the thermometers, and discuss what they had learned. In all, it required about 15-20 minutes. I led the rest of the class through the morning opening exercises at the same time. After each child had a turn working on the computer and recording data, we discussed our findings in a whole group lesson. We spent a 45- minute period posting the information on a bulletin board and drawing conclusions based on our data.

<p>Assessment Plan:

<p>The teachers made observations each day when working with a pair of students on the computer. A rubric (see attached) was then used to determine the students' level of competency. The student’s math skills were assessed by the success they had with the temperature recording sheets they filled in. The two recording sheets should be compared to make sure that the information coincides. Small group discussions also enable the teacher to assess the student’s ability to draw conclusions based on the information they had discovered.

<p>Reflection:

<p>Although I was very pleased with the student’s performances during this learning experience, I must admit I was a little hesitant at the beginning due to a lack of "computer knowledge" on my part. I was forced to learn some new skills for which I am now very grateful.

<p>I don’t think it would be possible to carry out this learning experience unless you have another adult in the room, whether it’s a teacher’s aide, student teacher or a parent volunteer. I think it’s very important to work in small groups and you must have someone by the computer at all times to make sure the students are accessing the information correctly.
