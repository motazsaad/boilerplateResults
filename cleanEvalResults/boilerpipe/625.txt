<p>Does anyone know the open carry status in Tennessee?  I'll be travelling there from NC at the end of this week.  Also, what about car carry?

<p>Cannot carry with "the intent to go armed"

<p>From what I understand about the law in TN, you cannot carry on your person or loaded in your car a pistol or any other loaded firearm. If you carry a loaded pistol on your person or in your car, it is defined by law a "carry with the intent to go armed" and is illegal unless you have a license to carry. So I would carry unloaded in a case and seperated from the ammunition.  -ICPjuggalo
