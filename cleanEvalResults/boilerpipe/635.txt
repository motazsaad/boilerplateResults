<p>MARGARET  WARNER: Amb. Negroponte, welcome, and thanks for being with us.

<p>We  have heard roughly that there was a 60 percent turnout. What is the latest you  can tell us or what more do you know about the ethnic breakdown of the turnout,  ethnic and religious?

<p>AMB. JOHN NEGROPONTE: I think it's very difficult  to say at this time. The Independent Iraqi Electoral Commission has even pulled  back a bit from giving out any estimates, and I think we're going to have to wait  for the next day or two before we get some reliable turnout figures.

<p>But  clearly there's going to be important representation from the Kurdish areas, from  the Shiia groups, from the non-sectarian parties based here in Baghdad, and probably  slightly lesser representation in terms of the proportions on the part of the  Sunni people living in the so-called Sunni Triangle area.

<p>Constructing  a future

<p>MARGARET  WARNER: And give us your sense of how soon, just in practical terms, we'll actually  see this transitional national assembly sit down to meet?

<p>AMB. JOHN NEGROPONTE:  Well, of course, this is the first time that all this is happening, so none of  us have much of an experience base to refer back to, but the results are supposed  to be known in the next seven or ten days; I think then there's allowance for  perhaps challenges and so forth, so let's assume a couple of weeks until the results  are finally certified.

<p>And then it will take some time for the new assembly  to organize itself and its first act will be to pick a new presidency, which it  will have to select by a two-thirds vote, so that could take several weeks time.

<p>MARGARET  WARNER: Now of course an overriding issue is how to get the Sunnis to participate  in this political process that's about to unfold. How do you think that is going  to go?

<p>AMB. JOHN NEGROPONTE: Well, first it is an important issue. I wouldn't  call it "the" overriding issue, by any means. I think the overriding  issue is to move the democratic process in this country forward and yesterday  was a major advance in that direction.

<p>Now, as far as the involvement of  Sunni or any other groups, what we've heard from the political leaders who are  candidates in this election is that they want to take an inclusive approach towards  the future political life of this country.

<p>So, I think you're going to  see efforts to involve the Sunni in the new executive branch, through cabinet  positions and the like, and I think there is also the intention to try and involve  them in various ways in the drafting of a new constitution.

<p>Because under  the interim constitution of Iraq, any

<p>combination  of three provinces at the time of the referendum on the constitution can block  ratification. So, it's very much in the interest of all concerned if only to get  the constitution ratified to include representation from all groups.

<p>MARGARET  WARNER: Are you personally in touch with senior members of what's been called  the Sistani Slate, even though we know he was neither a candidate nor officially  endorsed, but the United Iraqi Alliance, the Shiite-dominated slate, that is expected  to get the greatest number of votes. I mean, do you have a personal reading of  what their intentions are?

<p>AMB. JOHN NEGROPONTE: Well, we at various levels  in our embassy, right down to our political reporting officers we have maintained  contact with all segments of the Iraqi political spectrum and of course some of  the members of the Sistani List are people who are either in the government -  such as the finance minister, for example, or the vice president -- and others  are individuals whom we knew when there was a - a governing council at the time  of the coalition provisional authority, so I would say that we're quite well acquainted  with representatives of that list and in fairly constant dialogue with them.

<p>Encouraging  participation

<p>MARGARET  WARNER: Now what about the Sunni leaders who urged a boycott? They have at least  given interviews in which they said they want to be part of the process, but what  more can you tell us about their intention?

<p>AMB. JOHN NEGROPONTE: Well, there  is no monolithic Sunni leadership to my understanding, which is perhaps one of  the issues that has been a complicating factor.

<p>But certainly we have maintained  contact with a variety of leaders from the Al-Anbar and Nineveh Provinces, which  is where many of these Sunnis reside.

<p>I have myself, for example, been  in occasional contact with the leader of the Iraqi Islamic Party, which is Sunni-dominated.  So, again, we have reached out to those groups and intend to continue to do so  in the weeks and months ahead.

<p>MARGARET WARNER: But do you think that -  first of all - the fact of yesterday's election, the relatively high turnout,  do you think this is going to from what you know make them feel more estranged  and alienated or, in fact, encourage them that, you know, this train is leaving  the station, to use an old political cliché, and they should get involved?

<p>AMB.  JOHN NEGROPONTE: Right. I think it's actually

<p>encouraging  them to want to get on the train. In fact, I think initially a number of them  were really trying to test the system to see if they could somehow or another  cause a delay in the elections.

<p>But when the inevitability of the elections  became apparent, I think we saw a number of these Sunni groups and certainly Sunni  voters want to participate more in the political process and for example members  of some of the Sunni parties that were not actively involved in the election have  already indicated to us that they would like in some way to be involved in the  drafting of the constitution.

<p>So rather than having a polarizing effect,  as some have suggested, I think this election could well, in the end, have a unifying  consequence.
