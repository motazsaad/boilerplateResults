<h>1. Michael Schumacher

<p>Sunday: Fastest in warm-up but also suffered engine failure in spare car. Beaten into third place off the grid, moving up to second when Montoya stopped under the safety car.

Pitted and stopped for 11.4s on lap 38, dropped to second place and pushed by Raikkonen , retook lead when Montoya stopped on lap 51. Lead grew to 21s when Montoya retired on lap 57, but then eased up so victory by 1.1s. 1st

<p>Saturday: Fastest in both morning sessions. Engine very good in qualifying. Disappointed not to be able to fight for pole. Lost time on third run, his fastest. Didn't extract full potential from car. 2nd/1m 13.018s

<p>Friday: Glanced wall on outside of final chicane with right hand rear wheel towards end of morning session and pitted with broken wheel rim. Ran three sets of tyres as he worked on race set-up, determined not to leave anything for chance after last year's problems. 3rd/1m 15.788s

<p>2. Rubens Barrichello

<p>Sunday: No major problems in warm-up. Good start, running two stop strategy and up to second place, then overtaking Montoya to lead lap one when Montoya runs wide. Opened up 4.3s when safety car came out. Then opened up gap to teammate, to 5.0s before pitting for 10.6s, longish to clean out side pods. Rejoined sixth, just behind Coulthard , but then dropped back. Moved up to third again with pit stops, but then stopped again on lap 54 in 5.8s, dropping to fourth, just behind Coulthard. Tried to overtake Coulthard on lap 61 when Coulthard delayed by slower car but ran over kerb in final chicane and then settled on third to the flag. 3rd

<p>Saturday: Went off onto grass at turns eight/nine and on regaining track, locked up brakes and slammed into wall, damaging right hand front wheel. Hit kerb and spun at turn three/four on third run in qualifying. Admitted playing catch-up for most of the day. 4th/1m 13.301s

<p>Friday: Fastest in morning session, then short cut chicane in afternoon session and suffered brake problems. Finds car well balanced. Need to find right settings now. 8th/1m 16.440s
