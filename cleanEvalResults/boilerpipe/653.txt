<h>Easter Eggs in March.

<p>Then the leaves begin to reappear for the spring.

<p>New for this year, we're adding apple blossoms (made from tissue paper) to the tree in September and then change those blossoms to apples. Showing it as a fall apple tree  (before we do the color change on the leaves).

<p>Comments: This was a new idea for last year. We are going to use it this year to really discuss the changing seasons and also incorporate our apple lessons.
