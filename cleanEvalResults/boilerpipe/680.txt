<p>Immigration firms in Virginia offering J-1 applications, State               30, national interest waivers, permanent residency, and Canadian               doctors and physicians.

<p>Immigration attorneys offering representation to obtain           H-1B work visas, labor certifications and J-1           waiver applications for foreign medical graduates and physicians. Physicians who receive           clinical medical residency training in the U.S. pursuant to a J-1 exchange           visitor visa are required to return to their home country for two years           before they are eligible to apply for an H-1B visa or permanent           residency . J-1 visa physicians need not complete this two-year home           requirement if they are approved for a waiver to deliver medical services           in a designated underserved area or at a VA hospital. In addition, the           United States Congress, under the leadership of Senator Conrad, has           mandated that all states (as well as the District of Columbia and certain           territories, such as Puerto Rico and Guam) may act as interested state           agencies ( State 30 Program), recommending up to thirty (30) national           interest waivers for J-1 physicians per state each fiscal year.           These waiver recommendations are available in addition to any VA, ARC           or DHHS waivers that may be issued for locations within that state.           Most J-1 Visa Waivers typically require a three year service obligation.           However, certain states, such as West Virginia, require a four-year           contractfrom a immigration           firm in Virginia . All waiver programs require a showing that the           employer has made efforts to recruit a U.S. physician and a Canadian           doctor prior to offering a position to a J-1 physician.

<p>Robert Lubin offers work visas, Appalachian regional commission,               Conrad waivers, naturalization of business immigration, and law               firms in Washington DC area.

<p>Robert           Lubin & Associates, P.C. (formerly known as The Law Offices of Robert           Lubin, P.C.) was founded in 1988 and the firm focuses exclusively on work visas , Conrad           waivers , and immigration           law firm issues (with some business           immigration law services provided to immigration clients only). Naturalization is the process by which permanent residents can obtain U.S. citizenship           status. In some cases, dual citizenship may be retained. Since naturalized           citizens share practically all of the same rights as citizens born in           the United States, this is an important step to take to complete the           immigration process. Obtaining a J-1 waiver is a three-step process.           The first step is to obtain a recommendation for a waiver from an interested           government agency (IGA), like HHS or Appalachian           Regional Commission . This recommendation is then forwarded to the           United States Department of State Waiver Review Division in Washington,           D.C. (formerly known as the USIA), which in turn issues its recommendation           to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which provides           approval of an Application to Waive Foreign Residence Requirements (Form           I-612).

<p>The H-1B is a nonimmigrant           visa classification used by an applicant who will be employed temporarily           in a specialty occupation. Requirements include a job offer in a qualifying           occupation, a bachelor's degree or equivalent at a minimum, and an offered           salary that meets prevailing wage requirements. The H-1B           visa is a popular tool for temporary employment of foreign           medical graduates . Hardship           waiver if the U.S. citizen or permanent resident spouse and/or child           accompanies the J-1 visa holder back to the home country for two years.           Therefore, a hardship waiver application must establish that the U.S.           citizen or permanent resident spouse and/or child will suffer exceptionally           as a result of returning to the J-1 visa holder's home country and remaining           in the U.S. without the J-1 visa holder for two years. The ARC program           is limited to doctors who           have completed residency training in a primary care field, which is           generally defined as internal medicine, family practice, general practice,           pediatrics, general psychiatry or obstetrics and gynecology, and the           physician must agree to practice such primary care. We also offer information           on Conrad 30 and adjustments           of status .

<p>Immigration attorneys offering J-1 waivers, O-1 visas, and labor               certifications for international medical graduates, and foreign               doctors.

<p>Our immigration           attorneys offer O-1           visas are temporary nonimmigrant visas, available for highly talented           or acclaimed individuals in the sciences, education, business or athletics.           To qualify for an O-1 visa, the applicant must have extraordinary ability           "demonstrated by sustained national or international acclaim." Extraordinary           ability means a "level of expertise indicating that the person is one           of that small percentage who has risen to the very top of the field           of endeavor." The O-1 category is especially helpful to medical researchers           such as foreign doctors ,           athletes, and business people who may lack the qualifications or salary           required for the J-1 waiver program. In addition, to date, there have been no numerical limitations           reached on the J-1 program, thereby allowing any number of international           medical graduate applicants to qualify each fiscal year. In order           to apply for Labor           Certification (LC), an applicant must obtain an employer to sponsor           him/her through a job offer. The LC process consists of three phases           leading to permanent residency. The first phase involves obtaining a           Labor Certification from the Department of Labor (DOL). The second phase           involves obtaining an immigrant           visa petition approval from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration           Services (USCIS) based on the DOL Labor Certification. The third phase           involves the applicant's application to either adjust status from non-immigrant           to permanent resident here in the U.S., or obtain an immigrant visa           at an American Consulate in the home country.
