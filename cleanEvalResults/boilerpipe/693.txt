<p>1879 - The Tay Bridge Disaster

<p> 

<p> 

<p>Designed by Sir Thomas Bouch,                        the Tay Railway Bridge was opened in 1878.

<p>The single-track bridge was a box construction with numerous                          box-section legs, up to 230ft apart, supporting the steam                          trains up to 88ft in the air as they snaked for almost                          two miles over the Tay and Perth-bound shipping. Bouch                          had not designed his structure with the estuary winds                          considered in his calculations, nor had the contractor                          been supervised to prevent his use of badly manufactured                          material.

<p>These points were discovered after the bridge’s                          central sections failed during the stormy night of 28                          December 1879 while a train was crossing. The train, with                          seventy five passengers and crew, poured off the collapsing                          bridge into the icy river with all lives lost.

<p>Bouch, who was held entirely responsible, could not take                          the strain either and died shortly after the inquiry.                          When travelling on the 1887 replacement bridge over the                          Tay, the bases of the original’s supporting legs                          can be seen along the eastern side, reaching out of the                          cold water, a disturbing sight on a stormy crossing.

<p>William McGonagall remembers the night of the 28th well                          in his famous poem ‘Railway Bridge of the Silvery                          Tay’.
