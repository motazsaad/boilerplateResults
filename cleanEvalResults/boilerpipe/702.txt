<h>Questions that May be  Asked

<p>How would you put a new leather seat in the main valve  of the hydrant?

<p>I would shut off hydrant at hydrant branch gate, unscrew bolts that  hold bonnet and top plate down. Remove all fittings therefrom. Use wrench that is  specially designed for this purpose. Said wrench has a long cylinder and bottom is  constructed as to fit the logs of the false bronze seat ring.

<p>I would give wrench a few  turns to the left and unscrew. After this was done, I would pull wrench out of standpipe.  Then I would pull spindle out of standpipe with valves attached. Take off 2 iron nuts, take  off hold down nut bronze, remove old leather seat, put new leather seat on screw on  fittings named above and assemble in same manner.

<p>Notify Battalion Chief and 1st  alarm company.

<p>What care and attention do valves, hydrants and man holes  require?

<p>Valves and hydrants should be inspected each week; should be  wiped, oiled, tested and if any leak should be seen around glands, should be taken up or  repacked. Hose connections on hydrants should also be inspected and hydrantman should  be positive that all threads on same were not jammed so fireman would have no trouble  connecting hose.

<p>Man holes should be inspected and keep dry, free from water.  Spindles on all outlets should be made to work freely. By opening independent slide valve  and keeping main valve closed, it would be possible to know whether main valve seat was  tight and in good order. To inspect the independent valve, keep same closed and open main  valve.

<p>Parts of a Gate Valve

<p>Body: 2 bronze  seat rings screwed into casting. Single disc bonnet spindle, stuffing box, gland gears, gear  bracket, operating nut, indicator stem, elbows and bypass.. Also bushing.

<p>If a  hydrant was not operating properly where would you look for the  trouble?

<p>I would immediately look for fault in valve seat. It could be  possible for a small rock or piece of wood to get in between valve and seat. And the same  might jam valve so it would not seat properly and case a leak. It would also be noticeable  on top of spindle. If I thought the valve was damaged to any extent, I would install a new  one.

<p>If you find a high pressure hydrant broken at its outlet what would you  do?

<p>I would shut off the gate on the hydrant branch, notify the Battalion Chief  and 1st alarm company, and also Supt. of system to send me a new hydrant and 2 laborers.  Excavate down to the foot of the hydrant which is about 5 feet, unscrew studs between the  foot of the hydrant and the stand pipe. Lift same out with the aid of a tripoid and install new  one I had received. Test same, notify Batt. Chief of district and 1st alarm company and  report same to Supt. of system.

<p>How would you drain a portion of the system.  Say one block for repairs?

<p>I would close down 2 gates at the intersecting  streets so as to cut off supply in that particular block. Open hydrants when water stopped  flowing out of hydrants. By this means the section would be dry  drained.

<p>How would you proceed to fill pipes again?

<p>I would  plug portion of pipe I had tapped. Leave hydrant open to let air escape. Open section gate  very low. After I had line full, I would open other section gate.

<p>I would know that  section was full of solid water when hydrant at highest elevation flowed  freely.

<p>How would you test a new section of mains and hydrants in trenches  to determine whether section was tight or not and would stand maximum working  pressure?

<p>I would attach a line from a low pressure hydrant and connect to  suction of hand pump. Connect a line from discharge hand pump to outlet of high pressure  hydrant. See that all other hydrants were open to let air escape. Operate low pressure  hydrant slow after water was coming out of high pressure hydrant. I would close same and  work hand pump to pressure required which would be about 450 pounds per sq. inch.  Examine all joints of pipe and hydrant branches and foot of hydrant. If found the same in  good order, I would disconnect hand pump, close high and low pressure hydrants, open  section gate and let static head come through. The test hydrant valves and report same in  good order, ready for service.

<p>Describe the proper method of blowing off a  hydrant on a crowded or narrow street.

<p>I would shut down gate valve, muffle  hydrant outlet with sack or other cloth material, open hydrant to its full opening and blow it  off from the gate valve.

<p>Describe the process of testing stand pipe, 14 story  building.

<p>I would inspect said Standpipe beginning at basement, ascend  toward roof, closely examine all valves and outlets with the exception of valve on roof  which I would open to allow the air to escape.

<p>Then I would return to street, connect  hose to hydrant, to outlet of pump. [Take] another piece of hose from discharge end of  pump to inlet of standpipe Siamese. Turn on water at hydrant when it reached the roof and  flowed freely through valve on roof. Close roof valve which will give hydrant pressure.  Return to pump and work pump until gauge showed required pressure which would be  about 300 pounds per square inch. Then examine standpipe. Finding same in good  condition, I turned off water at hydrant, release pressure by opening jet cock on  pump.

<p>Return to ground floor, open drain valve located at bottom of standpipe. When  properly drained, disconnect hose at hydrant to pump, from pump to inlet of standpipe  Siamese, replaced all caps and plug. Close roof valve and report same.

<p>What  are the duties of a hydrantman with regard to cisterns?

<p>He shall examine all  cisterns in his district once each week. Keep them full of water. See that they are ready for  immediate use at all times. If anything should happen to impair their stability, these should  be reported to the Battalion Chief of district and Supt. of High Pressure System. There are  58 cisterns which vary from 18,000 gallons and up. Two cisterns located in Civic Center,  one under each fountain.

<p>With the new bond issue there will be 85 reinforced  cisterns.

<p>Explain the purpose and use of the bypass on high pressure gate  valves.

<p>A bypass on a gate valve is used to equalize the pressure on both side  of discs so it may be easy to operate.

<p>Hydrantman's Duties in Regard to a High  Pressure Hydrants are as follows:

<p>First: unscrew two nuts which allows covers to  be taken off. Open cap on 3 1/2 inch outlet. Open the main valve in the same hole bored for  that purpose. Close main cover, open 3 inch outlet independent valve which releases  pressure. Then proceed to take off all caps and open all independent valves. Wipe all  fittings with a piece of waste saturated with kerosene so as to free the same from all dust.  Oil all independent valves and bushing. Oil all outlets. Close independent valves, see that  same are not manned. Screw on caps on outlets. Be sure that main valve is seated. If main  valve should leak through gland, same should be taken up or repacked.

<p>After hydrant  is put in good working condition, the number of same and also hydrant gate should be  noted. Hydrant gate should be inspected and same kept free from water. If the frame of  said gate had sunk below the grade of street, it should be reported on daily report.

<p>The  vaults of section gates in a hydrantman's district should be inspected. If by any reason  water or gas was found in same, it should be reported. If seepage should be noticed  coming through any of the highways same should be reported to Water Company or Supt.  of System.
