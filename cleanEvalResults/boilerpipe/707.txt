<p>Copyright of www.siggolds.com TASI HOME PAGE The Traditional Archery Society of Ireland  Preserving the ways of our Forefathers  The constitution is available for your perusal. Please check this page at regular intervals as it is undergoing construction.  Here is a short passage to give you the flavour of what is to come with the main text later.Clann na Ulaidh are dedicated to re-enactment and living history both Viking and Celtic and use Archers from time to time, these archers are, by agreement with the Clann, either TASI archers trained as re-enactors or Clann archers trained by TASI for re-enactment shooting.   Perhaps that last paragraph will help you get the flavour of TASI members.   Many of the TASI members are of course BLBS/GNAS/IFAF members and shoot mainly competitive Target and Field events. I would be one of those, I've  done very few re-enactment events.  Hilary on the other hand is very prominent in the re-enactment and living history scene and travels all over the Ireland and England attending in costume at many prestigeous events. She also organises and promotes re-enactment events here in the province. This to me is what Traditional archery is all about preservation of the OLDER forms of the archers skill in Bowmaking, Fletching, Historic research, much as practiced by Boyd Rankin who was one of the founders of the group now known as TASI.
