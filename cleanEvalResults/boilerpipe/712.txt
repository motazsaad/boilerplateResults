<p>Here's how teens can reduce risk of assault By Leslie Vryenhoek, Canadian Red Cross June 7, 2005

<p>School‚Äôs ending and summer‚Äôs starting. Forget about rules, let‚Äôs party!  Hold on there ‚Äì summer is the best time for adventure, but you want it to be memorable for the magical moments, not the bad things that might happen.

<p>Some summer dangers are obvious‚Äîlike sunburn, bug bites and poison ivy. These are easily preventable: wear sunscreen and cover up in long loose layers when in the woods or tall grass.

<p>Other dangers are less obvious. For example, sexual predators can take advantage of the unsupervised days and late nights to prey on young people, either online or in person. Attractive promises can entice youth into risky situations.

<p>‚ÄúOften these adults offer to take young people camping, or provide a place to party or swim. These adults or older adolescents gain the trust of their teen ‚Ä?friends,‚Äô and then sexually assault them,‚Äù explains Judi Fairholm, National Manager for RespectED: Violence & Abuse Prevention at the Canadian Red Cross.

<p>Drugs and alcohol increase vulnerability

<p>Drugs and alcohol are often used as an enticement. Unfortunately, these only increase the vulnerability of young people, who may be too stoned to fight, and who may feel trapped into keeping the secret because they broke the rules. Awareness is the first line of defense.

<p>Understand that it is not usual or healthy for older people to want to hang out with young friends.

<p>Hang out with people close to your own age, and with whom you feel safe.

<p>Always feel free to say ‚Äúno‚Äù to luring offers ó even if feels like you‚Äôre hurting someone‚Äôs feelings.

<p>Dating violence

<p>Dating violence and sexual assault among teens is also far too common. In fact, studies have found as many as 25% of teens will experience violence in a dating relationship before they reach adulthood. Unsupervised open-air parties provide a warm and romantic setting, but things can quickly become too hot to handle, especially when drinking or drugs are in the mix.

<p>‚ÄúEveryone has the right to establish boundaries and expect respect, that they have a right to refuse any sexual activity, and that they have the responsibility to always respect the limits another person sets,‚Äù Ms. Fairholm stresses.

<p>Alcohol and drugs significantly increase risk of assaults. ‚ÄúWe know that 74% of males and 55% of females involved in acquaintance rapes had been drinking or taking drugs just before the attack.‚Äù

<p>Peer violence can also pose a problem. While we usually associate bullying with the schoolyard, in fact, the lack of school supervision can lead to increased risk. Is there violence or the threat of violence in your social circle? Do you feel safe and valued with your group? If not, find new friends ó seriously. Loneliness is awful, but no one deserves to be someone else‚Äôs punching bag, verbally, physically or emotionally.

<p>Safety plan

<p>You can have fun and stay safe by developing a safety plan.

<p>Tell your parents where you are going and when you‚Äôll be home. It shouldn‚Äôt make you feel like a kid; after all, adults usually let their loved ones know where they‚Äôll be!

<p>Attend gatherings only with trusted friends.

<p>Designate someone who will remain sober and drug-free throughout. Anyone who will be driving must remain sober and straight, of course, but even if there‚Äôs no driving, there should be someone who‚Äôs keeping a sober watch.

<p>Stay with the group and don‚Äôt go off alone with a suitor; if you leave one place, make sure your friends know where you‚Äôve gone and with whom.

<p>Have a plan to call for help immediately if things start to get out of hand.

<p>Don‚Äôt be afraid to seek assistance from adults.

<p>Most importantly, friends need to take care of one another, and everybody must listen to their instincts and heed the earliest warning signs.
