<h>Skip the INTRO, Go RIGHT to the CATALOG!

<p>To make your life easier, and help you find exactly what you want, we have broken the on-line slide rule catalogs into smaller sections. Just CLICK on the icon of the rule type you are looking for at the left, to see the matching catalog.  Large graphical catalogs are a bit SLOW, please give them time to load.

<p>You can order anything here just by picking up the phone, and calling (250) 769-1834 during normal office hours, 8am to 5pm, PST.  We process VISA/MC orders immediately.  You can also send your order by FAX at: (250) 769-4106.  New Canada ExpressPost Rates, shipping and packing minimum of US$18/C$23 for any insured air shipment up to 1kg.

<p>We have been lucky to find a wide variety of original slide rule manuals and hardcover books from all over the world. We have POST, K+E, Faber-Castell, and Hemmi manuals, plus some very useful general books to help you get the best value out of your favorite slide rule.

<p>We have quite a bit of trouble finding good copies, especially of K+E hardcovers, and we can't always ensure we have all of these in stock, as locating them is a bit of a hit-and-miss thing.  What we have changes every month, so check this page regularly if you are looking for something you don't see today.

<p>We accept Visa/MC or Int'l MO for orders. If we have your valid data on file, you can just click on the ORDER email link to place an order and indicate your approval to bill, and we will do the rest. If this is the first time you have dealt with us, you can phone (250) 769-1834 or FAX (250) 769-4106 the billing info, or send it by the email link, as you prefer. Personal checks have to clear before shipment.
