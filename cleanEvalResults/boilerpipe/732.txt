<h>SPLITTING FILM

<p>SPLITTING FILM

<p>Since many film types were only available from the film manufacturers in 35mm stock, several submini camera manufacturers designed film splitters to allow cutting a smaller strip of film from 35mm stock. With a film slitter, you can get some amazing film into your submini, such as 2475 recording film, B&W or color infrared film, Tech pan, Agfapan 25 and Ektar 25.  Sometimes called film slitters -- and NOT to be confused with film SPLICERS -- these devices came in various styles to cut different size strips. Some cut a 35mm strip in half to produce two 17.5mm strips for cameras that used that size film. Others would cut 16mm strips, 9.5mm strips and even 8mm strips. Some of the companies that made these slitters were GaMi, Minolta, Yashica, Ricoh, Mikroma, Microtec, Acmel, and Varitype. There are undoubtedly more. They basically work the same way. Using razor blades, of some type, they cut out smaller strips of film from 35mm film. These items are no longer being made and are very difficult to find.

<p>If you are handy or determined, you might even want to built your own slitter. All you need are a few small pieces of wood, a couple of razor blades, some basic tools, a little ingenuity and time.  Here are some pictures of a completed splitter. With this slitter, you place a bulk roll of 35mm film on the part that looks like a black handle. The film is pressed down onto the cutting block and a removeable pressure plate is screwed on top. Then the film is pulled through the slitter and rolled up on the other side. Two pieces of felt on either side of the film keep it from getting scratched.

<p>You can use various materials in the construction of your slitter.  The decision on material is up to you.  Wood is normally easier to work with if you just have standard tools, but other materials may offer advantages, if you are familiar with them and have the necessary tools.  In building your own slitter, one big problem you will come across is that the film is measured in millimeters, but American building materials are normally cut in inches. To complicate matters even more, when you add in the razor blades inbetween the wood blocks, the width is increased very slighly, but it can be enough to through off careful measurements. Here are some helpful measurements:

<p>3/8" wood = .375 inches = 9.525mm -- A piece of wood this thick will need     to be sanded down somewhat to produce the size of the Minox film (9.2mm).

<p>5/8" wood = .625 inches = 15.875mm -- A piece of wood this thick (plus the     added thickness of the razor blade) should be just right for 16mm film.

<p>11/16" wood = .6875 inches = 17.4625mm -- A piece of wood this thick (plus     the added thickness of the razor blade) should be just right for 17.5mm film.

<p>1 3/8" wood = 1.375 inches = 34.925mm -- Pieces of wood that total to this     thickness (plus the added thicknesses of the razor blades) should be just     right for the total width of the 35mm film.

<p>If you need just a little extra spacing, pieces of construction paper will     probably work fine.  If you need a little less spacing, sand down the     wood with fine sand paper, measuring as you go.

<p>Here are a few diagrams to use depending on the type and size of film you plan to slit.  The diagrams are NOT to scale.
