<p>The Best of "Charles Buchan's  Football Monthly"

<p>edited by Simon Inglis

<p>FOR MANY FIFTY-something football fans, Charles Buchan's Football Monthly was a must-have throughout the year. It was an indispensible guide to what was happening on the pitch and on the terraces at a time when television wasn't exactly common currency. So this fantastic compilation of the best of the magazine should prove a brilliant stocking-filler for every grey-haired (or balding... or both) couch potato footie-fan in the country. A real crowd pleaser! Read more.
