<h>What              does assigning markets mean?

<p> 

<p> 

<p>If              you decide to have more than one broker or agent obtain quotations              on your behalf it is wise to assign each one, the specific insurance              markets they may approach. Generally the top three or four choices              made by the broker/agent are assigned to the agent or broker that              chooses them, if there is no conflict with the other brokers or agents.

<p>Should              I buy an insurance program based on lowest cost?

<p> 

<p> 

<p>Not              necessarily. Bottom line costs up front are not always an accurate              reflection of total costs over the policy term. 1. For instance, poor              claims handling can substantially increase your indirect costs this              year and your indirect costs over the next four years under a Workers'              Compensation policy. 2. Another factor might be an auditable policy              based on sales or receipts which increases your total costs far beyond              expectations by the end of the year.

<p>Q.

<p>How              do I know if the insurance carrier quoting my insurance is financially              stable and responsive to claims submitted?

<p>In              order to determine financial stability and claims paying history of              a property/casualty insurance company you can look them up on www.ambest.com              and look under - Rating Information - Rating Search - by insurance              company name. This rating gives you a good idea of the insurance company's              ability to pay claims in the event of a covered loss, and a good indication              of their financials for future stability and claims paying ability.

<p>What              limits of insurance do I need to carry?

<p> 

<p> 

<p>Minimum              Limits of Liability for a start-up organization should be at least              $1,000,000 and preferably $5,000,000. As a start-up - you don't want              to go out of business before you really get started - which could              happen in the event of a loss. 1) As your organization grows larger              and becomes more successful the possibilities of loss become greater              because the organization usually has more clients/customers and therefore              usually more exposure. It is not unusual for mid-sized organizations              to insure their liability for limits in excess of $50 Million. 2)              At a given point - as the organization begins to see the cost of insurance              as a large expense item, they start taking measures to better control              their losses, hire an insurance risk manager and perhaps even look              into self-insurance.
