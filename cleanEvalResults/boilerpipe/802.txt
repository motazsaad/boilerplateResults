<p>Chip Cartoon Characters

<p>Yesterday in the course of our conversation about National Chip Week Steve asked if a chip or French fry has ever ever had a starring role in a film or TV series. So a resounding hats off to listener Paul Callow who emailed to to tip us off about the existence a crime fighting box of chips named Frylock. Frylock is one of the stars of an overnight show on Cartoon Network in the US called Aqua Teen Huger Force. More info on the Cartoon Network site .
