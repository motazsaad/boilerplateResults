<h>Czech Republic

<p>Legislative          Framework

<p>In          1992 the Czech and Slovak Federation was dissolved and each republic became          independent. In both republics the same higher education reform was passed          in 1991. The new law abolished central planning by the ministries and          re-established institutional autonomy, including the authority to establish          curricula, regulate student numbers and create new faculties. The reforms          also introduced the bachelor degree and an independent accreditation system.          Student enrollments increased rapidly after 1991 — doubling in the          first eight years. By 1998, the Czech system of higher education consisted          of 27 universities and other more specialized institutions offering degrees          after four-to-six years of study. The system did not include a recognized          non-university sector.

<p>The Higher          Education Act of 1998 and its amendment of 2001 allowed for more sweeping          reforms including the creation of a binary system of university and non-university          education, the establishment of private institutions, the creation of          a two-tiered system — bachelor’s and master’s — alongside the traditional four-to-six year integrated programs, and the          increased importance of the independently run Accreditation          Commission in the validation of study programs.

<p>Under the          1998 Higher Education Act, higher vocational schools can apply for accreditation          to award degrees at the bachelor's level (or higher), either in their          own name or under the umbrella of a university. Currently the Czech Republic          has 57 institutions of higher education: 24 public, 4 state (military          and police), and 29 private institutions of higher education.

<p>1. Easily          Readable and Comparable Degrees

<p>? The Czech Republic has signed and ratified the Lisbon Convention on the          Recognition of Degrees, the provisions of which legally came into force          in 2000.

<p>? The diploma          supplement was introduced into the Czech system under the          Higher Education Act of 1998, which states that the supplement must be          issued upon student request. The language of the diploma supplement is          not prescribed. The European model of the diploma supplement was promoted          during two NARIC seminars in 1999 and 2000. Feedback from institutions          suggests that they have not had much experience with the supplement and          the number of applications for it has not been too high. Ultimately, they          intend to issue it to every student automatically in Czech or English.

<p>? The Center for Higher Education Studies operates as the Czech ENIC/NARIC offering consulting and advisory services          for institutions of higher education and the Ministry          of Education in the recognition and evaluation of academic credentials.

<p>2. Degree          Structure

<p>Stage          I: Bachelor's-level programs lead to the academic degree of Bakalár (Bc.) or Bakalár Umení (BcA) in          the field of Arts (introduced 1999). These degrees are generally awarded          after three-to-four years of study at a recognized institution of higher          education and prepare students to be admitted to a Magistr degree program. At the same time, they prepare graduates for a profession.          A final state examination (Statni Rigorozni Zkouska),          part of which is the defense of a thesis, is required to graduate. It          should be stressed that many stakeholders in Czech education (employers          and students alike) are still skeptical of the bachelor’s as a qualification          in its own right. Therefore, a 2001 White Paper set the target of getting          fifty percent of graduates from bachelor programs to enter the workforce          rather than continue into a master’s program.

<p>Stage          I & II: Despite the introduction of bachelor-type degrees,          universities continue to offer one-tiered, integrated master’s degree          programs that take between four-to-six years, although these long programs          are now an exception rather than the norm. Post-graduate programs that          follow the Bakalár take one-to-three          (most commonly two) years of study, and lead to the Magistr in the humanities, natural sciences, mathematics and theology. The title          of Inzenyr is awarded in technical, agricultural          and economic fields. Finally, the title of Doctor Medicíny as the result of a first degree is now awarded in the medical sciences          (medicine 6 years, dentistry 5-6 years, veterinary medicine and pharmacy          5 years). The fields of architecture and law also only offer integrated          programs.

<p>Stage          III: Doctoral programs (Doktor) have          a standard length of three years of full-time study beyond the master’s          level. Doctoral programs require the defense of a dissertation and the          passing of an Examen Rigorosum.

<p>? Short master's programs of the kind that build on a first university degree,          were formally added to the traditional one-tiered programs in 1990 and          described in more detail in the Higher Education Act of 1998 and the 2001          amendment. The amended law of 2001 makes it compulsory to complete undergraduate          studies before beginning postgraduate studies. Only over the last five          years have a majority of Czech higher education institutions begun to          introduce “short” master’s programs. The delay in the          implementation of bachelor programs was a result of the realization by          higher education institutions that simply dividing the existing curricula          would not meet the criteria of a genuine two-tiered system defined by          learning outcomes.

<p>? Early skepticism from institutions, students and the labor market over          the adoption of the two-tiered system is waning. Hence, more and more          short-cycle master’s programs are replacing the one-tiered programs,          especially after they were more clearly defined in the 2001 amendment          to the Higher Education Act (one-to-three years compared to two-to-three          previously) and have been promoted and supported by the Transformation          and Development Program since 2000.

<p>? Non-university higher education institutions continue to offer bachelor's-level          programs, and only a few have been accredited to offer master’s          programs. They may not, however offer doctoral programs. All private institutions          are currently of the non-university type.

<p>3. Credit          Transfer

<p>? Most Czech universities use their own credit system, as there is no unified          system at the national level. Credit systems are less common in non-university          institutions of higher education. No legal provisions oblige institutions          to use credit systems and there is no general rule as to how to allocate          credits.

<p>? Since October 1997, the Czech Republic has been successfully participating          in the Socrates, Erasmus and Leonardo da Vinci programs. The ECTS system          was established at most higher education institutions as an instrument          for international mobility through the SOCRATES-ERASMUS programs and the transfer of foreign-earned credits. All universities          use ECTS for transfer. Some non-university higher education institutions          (colleges and polytechnics) also use ECTS for transfer. As a rule, institutions          that wish to participate in the Socrates international mobility programs          have introduced ECTS for transfer.

<p>? Traditionally, credits have been used as a means of measuring student          workload while their utilization as an accumulation tool has been minimal.          The latest Bologna report from the Ministry states “the number of          institutions, namely university-type institutions, which use the accumulative          function to enable their students more flexible paths within a respective          study program has been growing.” The use of ECTS for accumulation          is especially popular at technical universities, whereas in the non-university          sector programs tend to be less adaptable.

<p>? A national team has been established          by the Council of Higher Education Institutions and since the beginning          of the current academic year has been providing consultative services          nationally and internationally regarding the implementation of ECTS.

<p>The Charles University (Prague)          Law School ECTS information package offers the following ECTS/Czech          grade equivalency:
