<h>Evaluating the Bologna          Degree in the U.S.

<p>and Robert Sedgwick, Editor, WENR

<p>The          first Bologna bachelor's degrees were awarded in 2003, which means that          European students will soon begin using the new qualifications to gain          entry to graduate-level programs in the United States. The Bologna bachelor's          is (in most cases) a three-year, freestanding degree designed to prepare          students for further study or employment. How          then does this new degree compare with the traditional American bachelor's          degree? At first glance, there are some fairly obvious similarities between          the two: the nomenclature is the same, and both are terminal first degrees          leading to either access to the job market or graduate study. At the same          time, the degrees are quite different from one another, as we shall see.

<p>In the last          issue of WENR we presented an overview of the new Bologna bachelor's degree,          comparing and contrasting it with the traditional first degrees in Europe.          This article puts the Bologna degree up against the American bachelor's          and illustrates how it will be evaluated when presented in the U.S. for          graduate study.

<p>The U.S.          Bachelor's Degree

<p>In the United          States, institutions set degree requirements in terms of credits that          are typically distributed over a period of four years. Each year is divided          into semesters or quarters. The built-in flexibility of the system allows          students to adjust the number of credits they choose to complete annually,          so it is possible for students to earn their degrees in less than four          years. They can also take longer than four years to complete their undergraduate          education if they take fewer credits or attend school on a part-time basis.

<p>Most bachelor's          degree programs require the completion of a minimum of 120 semester credits          drawn from three areas of study: general education, the major and electives.

<p>General education          is unique to the American system of undergraduate education. It is generally          known as "the breadth component of the undergraduate curriculum and          is usually defined on an institution-wide or college-wide basis. It generally involves study in several subject areas and frequently aims to provide          a common undergraduate experience for all students at a particular institution.          It has been variously described as the necessary prerequisite for specialized          study" (Levine 78).

<p>Students          are usually expected to complete their general education requirements          early on in their undergraduate studies. Most undergraduates undertake          these courses during their freshman and sophomore years before they begin          to concentrate on a major.

<p>General education          can be offered as either core curricula, distribution requirements or          free electives. When it is set in the form of a core curriculum, general          education consists of a set of common, broadly based and interdisciplinary          courses usually required of all students and consist of subjects in the          humanities, social sciences and natural sciences. Distribution requirements          ensure that students complete their general education by taking a minimum          number of courses or credits in specified academic areas drawn from the          humanities, social sciences and natural sciences. Free electives allow          students to take courses outside their major to fulfill the general education          requirements.

<p>The quantity          of general education varies from institution to institution. However,          on average between 40 and 60 percent of U.S. bachelor's degree programs          are devoted to general education. The remaining credits are devoted to          the major and related subjects.

<p>Comparing          the Two Degrees

<p>Even though          the Bologna Process has resulted in shorter degree programs that are defined          in terms of required credits and introduced a two-tiered (undergraduate/graduate)          system, the new European bachelor's is still quite distinct from its U.S.          counterpart. Based on the sample "Bologna" bachelor's degrees          we examined from Austria and Italy (see previous issue of WENR ),          it is apparent that the European degrees are more heavily concentrated          in the major — or specialization — and that the general education          component which is so crucial to U.S. undergraduate education is absent.          The new degrees, awarded by traditional European institutions, are undeniably          European in character.

<p>Below we have juxtaposed two programs for a bachelor's degree in business          administration: one from Indiana University in Bloomington, and the other from the Bocconi          University in Milan, Italy.

<p>In the Italian          program, courses in the major are taken starting in the first semester          of study. The entire curriculum is devoted to business and related subjects          including mathematics, computer science and foreign languages that are          all taught in the same faculty. The sheer number of required courses in          business and related subjects indicates that the program is heavily concentrated          in the major, which is covered in great depth.

<p>In comparison,          the U.S. degree program includes subjects drawn from a wide range of disciplines to fulfill the university's general education and distribution requirements.          The Kelly School of Business mandates that students who major in business "take at least 62 semester credits outside of business and economics          coursework" in the different departments and faculties at Indiana          University. Courses in the major and related subjects constitute 50% of          the 124 credits required for the bachelor’s degree.

<p>At the same          time, the objectives and intended outcomes of both programs are remarkably          similar as they aim to equip students with the tools and skills required          for employment or for graduate education in their chosen field.

<p>The Kelly          School of Business states that its graduates should “possess a broad-based          knowledge of business and the business environment and the role that business          plays in society; understand the national, international, political, social          and economic environment that landscapes a firm’s operations; be          able to articulate their thoughts orally and in writing and be computer          literate; understand and incorporate ethical principles in all processes          and decisions; possess an appreciation of the opportunities and problems          involved in managing complex organizations; have the skills and capability          to work effectively with others in the completion of joint tasks; possess          the ability to find and formulate problems, think analytically, and recommend          solutions; have the understanding and expertise needed to function effectively          in an advanced technological society.”

<p>The Bocconi          program aims to "give students an understanding of the economic,          financial, social, cultural, legal and technological foundations of business,          and to equip them with the analytical and decision making tools that will          allow them to manage different businesses in a changing environment. Graduates          will be qualified for professional and managerial positions in marketing,          sales, finance or human resources.”

<p>The main          differences between the two programs — the number of years of study,          the amount of coursework devoted to the major, and the absence of general          education from the Italian curriculum — reflect the distinct characteristics          of each educational system

<p>The Evaluation

<p>The task          for the credential evaluator is to examine the new qualification and determine          whether it constitutes sufficient preparation for graduate admission in          the U.S. To achieve that end, it is necessary to establish a coherent          set of criteria that can be used for comparing the American and European          degrees. The main criteria that World Education Services (WES) considers          when assessing a degree are the level, structure, scope and intent of          the program. Those factors are expressed in terms of: requirements for          admission to the program; its contents and structure; and the function          that the credential is designed to serve in the home system, respectively.          After having considered all the relevant factors, WES regards the new          three-year Italian laurea as functionally equivalent to a U.S.          bachelor's degree.

<p>The number          of years of study is merely one of the elements that define the structure          of a program. In this particular case, the discrepancy in the number of          years between the Italian and U.S. bachelor's degrees is outweighed by          the similarities between the two programs.

<p>Failure to          recognize the Bologna bachelor's degree solely because it is a three-year          qualification would leave U.S. graduate schools no choice but to reject          candidates who apply for admission using these degrees, even when their          records demonstrate that they have completed more than enough subjects          in their discipline, have achieved the same skills and level of knowledge          as their U.S. counterparts, and would very likely succeed at the graduate          level. Such decisions would not only lack any academic merit, but they          would also have profound and negative implications for international academic          mobility.

<p>CONCLUSION

<p>Academic          credentials serve as recorded proof of an individual’s itinerary          and accomplishments within a coherent and unified system of education. Credential          evaluation exists first and foremost to facilitate the international mobility          of students, scholars and professionals. This ideal is codified in the Convention          on the Recognition of Qualifications Concerning Higher Education in          the European Region, adopted in 1997 and signed by 41 countries including          the United States. The Convention calls on member states to promote, encourage          and facilitate the recognition of credentials earned outside of their          borders to encourage the mobility of students and professionals. It also          specifies that "Each country shall recognize qualifications as similar          to the corresponding qualifications in its own system unless it can be          shown that there are substantial differences."

<p>To be effective,          credential evaluation must examine the nature, structure and objectives          of different systems of education and build the bridges that allow students          and professionals to use their educational qualifications internationally.

<p>SAMPLE          PROGRAMS

<p>Kelley                School of Business (Indiana University)

<p>The                bachelor's program at the Kelley School of Business provides a general-education                component complemented by the study of business and economics. The                application of this principle promotes a balanced program of study                while it enables a student with an interest in a professional area                of business to specialize in that field.

<p>In                addition, all undergraduate programs include courses that ensure                the development of a basic understanding of the principles and practices                involved in the management of business firms in the dynamic economic,                social, and political environment of the world today. Four interrelated,                rigorous junior-level courses in marketing management, operations                management, financial management, and strategic management, known                collectively as the integrative core, are required of all business                majors. Consideration is given also to basic trends that are likely                to shape the pattern of the business world in the years ahead. Beyond                these basic requirements, students are given an opportunity to pursue                studies from a wide variety of subject areas.

<p>Graduates                of the Undergraduate Program of the Kelley School of Business at                Indiana University should have a general knowledge and appreciation                of accomplishments in the physical sciences, arts, humanities, and                social sciences; possess a broad-based knowledge of business and                the business environment and the role each business plays in society;                understand the national, international, political, social, and economic                environment that landscapes a firm's operations; be able to articulate                their thoughts orally and in writing and be computer literate; understand                and incorporate ethical principles in all processes and decisions;                possess an appreciation of the opportunities and problems involved                in managing complex organizations; have the skills and capability                to work effectively with others in the completion of joint tasks;                possess the ability to find and formulate problems, think analytically,                and recommend solutions; have the understanding and expertise needed                to function effectively in an advanced technological environment.
