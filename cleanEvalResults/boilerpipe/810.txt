<p>Disposition

<p>The topics were discussed in order of mention. After the group                felt that the list was complete, the facilitator invited them to                define and comment on the topics. They added very little more detail                than they had presented in their opening remarks. They did state                that in order to succeed in evaluating telemental health services,                they needed to collect more data than they had been.

<p>Focus group members reported that they had little or no experience                with the evaluation of telemental health services. Nine participants                reported being involved in reporting for OAT, but none of them were                familiar with mental health evaluation tactics, systems, or with                the evaluation concerns in the public system. One respondent commented                on the efforts of OAT to produce a common evaluation form for telehealth,                which, in their opinion was “something that simply will not                work for telemental health.”

<p>The original effort to develop an evaluation form for consumers                produced one that was “very complex, demanded a high reading                level - meaning most consumers could not fill it out reliably.” Another respondent reported trying to implement a Minimum Data Set                approach, similar to that underway at the Center for Mental Health                Services. This respondent developed a form with questions for the                consumer, presenter, and consultant, each assessment being one side                of a page that takes a minute or so to fill out. In terms of content,                it works like a report card, with questions such as “did the                encounter fulfill intent, did it work, will the consumer get better.” Many participants argued for control group studies, but agreed that                most studies in all specialties have converged on the finding that                access to specialty services increases the likelihood of improved                outcomes. Participants presented anecdotal evidence that telemental                health works well. One told the story of the psychiatrist who said: “I think people are freer, more natural than when they come                here, and therefore I am getting more and better information.” The psychiatrist posed the question whether it is better if a patient                drives 150 miles to see him, struggles to find parking, may be treated                rudely, and probably has a long wait.

<p>A valuable set of performance indicators has been developed for                mental health and could be used by telemental health programs. The                performance indicators are currently being implemented in all states                for publicly funded mental health services. Supported by the Center                for Mental Health Services, the indicators are being developed through                the Mental Health Statistics Improvement Program (MHSIP).

<p>The 1996 MHSIP Report Card covers domains of access, appropriateness,                prevention, and outcome from the point of view of the consumer.                These domains have provided the initial framework for indicators                developed by other organizations (the National Association of State                Mental Health Program Directors; the American College of Mental                Health Administration and the National Association of Psychiatric                Health Systems; and the Association of Behavioral Group Practices.                The Federal Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA, 1993)                was an external factor influencing the development of the MHSIP                Report Card. GPRA is federal legislation requiring federal programs                to have performance indicators in place by Fiscal Year 1999 (Manderscheid,                R.W., 2000).

<p>MHSIP is a community of people working together since the early                1970s. MHSIP currently has a second version of the MHSIP Report                Card in draft form. An integrated set of mental health data standards                is also being developed through Decision Support 2000+. Telemental                health would do well to utilize the data standards being developed                and implement the MHSIP performance indicators found in other mental                health programs.
