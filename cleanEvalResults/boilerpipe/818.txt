<h>Anastasia         Fedorova/Nastya (Syktyvkar, Russia)

<p>I was contacted by this person (could be a man or a woman as photos are         stock images they use) when he/she answered my Personals ad on the Yahoo Personals.  Luckily right off the bat I was suspicious, but continued         correspondence to see the progression, which ultimately ended with theLetter 13 request for money for the passport/visa. This site alerted me         early on, as "her" photos were among those listed on here as known scammers.  "her" letters also followed the typical non-response to my         questions from previous emails, and the form letters fell in love with me for no         good reason so quickly.  Her initial letter said to call her either Anastasia OR         Nastya.

<p>Letter 1:

<p>Hi. I was pleasantly surprised when has found out your answer in my mail         box.  I have tried to write to you but I thought that you will not answer to me.  It so is interesting to correspond with the foreign man from America.

<p>Letter 7:

<p>Hi my friend Dave. I'm very glad to write you today. It's warm here. I thought         about you Dave this days.  Usually I spent my time at my home in weekend.         I don't know what to do in weekends and I clean my  flat watch tv and read. I         want to change my life and find the man which will make me happy and  which I make happy too. Every day I wake up at morning 6-7 o'clock, have         my breakfast which usually I prepare by myself, I like to have tea at morning.         Then I go to my work, I stand on bus stop and go to my work. Sometimes when I have much time before start of my work I go to my work on foot and  it takes about 15-20 minutes. I like to walk sometimes and you? I am at work         up to 7 o'clock evening.  (I start to work at 9 morning). I like to work and I         think without work it is very boring to me.  I don't know which quotations in         your country but I want to tell you about our economic life.  Our people hope         that everything must be all right soon, our people trust our president Vladimir  Putin, but I badly know the politics and I think it's not my enthusiasm. So my         salary is about 1,5-2 thousands of roubles per month. and it's about 50-70         american dollars if you want to know. But our prices is not very big, for         example I pay about 700-800 roubles for my rent flat and other  money I         spend for food, clothe and other things. For example bread cost about 5-6roubles and usual  dress about 600-800 roubles. I don't know it's interesting to you or not but it's the life in Russia.  It's the very big salaries in Moscow about 7000-30000 roubles but the flats cost very much, for example  if you wanted to buy the flat in Moscow it will cost about 20000-100000 american dollars. It's fantastic  sums and if someone want to rent the flat it will be 200-300 dollars per month. I don't know prices         of your country. After 7 o'clock I go home, watch tv, read or sometimes I go with my girlfriends         Olga and Luda in cafe and we speak a lot, have tea. Sometimes we go to cinema         or in sports hall. I want to find someone and change my life I want to live for         someone, who knows maybe it's you Dave. I had one man before and he was not the best choice. He liked to drink alcohol very much         and when he was drunk he become angry and silly. It offended me much and we have parted.         Some times he has struck me. I don't love him and decide to live alone. Now         I want to find someone, I don't know the destiny and I tried to write you, you         answer to me and now I'm interested in you and want know all about you, you may ask me all questions what you want Dave. I'll answer you. I told my         girlfriends and my mother about you Dave. They said that it's good but I must         be cautious first time and must don't make a mistake. They says Hi to you         Dave. I want to know you better please tell me more about you, I want to         know how is your day, how you like to spend time. I'll wait for your answer. I         send you my other photo today, all my photos was made not very much timeago. Hope you  like it. Please call me Anastasia because Nastya occurs from aNASTyAsia,         and Nastya it's children's name. When we will be much closer you could call me so.         Your good friend Anastasia.

<p>Letter 13:

<p>Hi my love Dave!  Today is not hot here again, and I'm thinking of you Dave. It         was a great day when I received  the first letter from you I thank the God and         I know that I found the man which name is Dave and I love you. Today I find         out up to the end all about opportunities come to you. The last weekend was         too slowly lasted without hearing of you Dave, and I miss you Dave. I am         pleased with an opportunity to meet you soon, and I want it very much, I         think you want it too, your letters was the ray of light in my life. As you know         I was not interested in moving to other country but I will do it because I found         my love and it's you Dave!!! We have firm in our city which makes the documents for people who want to leave the country.  I asked about moving to your country and I got the answer that I need the visa, foreign  passport and some other documents for registration. We have defined(determined) a         type of  the visa and it's type which allows to marry in the future but if it will         be not realize I  must return to my country after ninety days it's limit for visa.         I asked about prices and was  very surprised, first I ask about terms (time) of         performance and they said that there is many  people who wants to make         documents and leave the country but if I'll make the application now,  and pay for it now they will make all documents not more than two weeks, and if         I'll not make  the application, documents will be prepared not earlier than two         or three months because  there are many people who wants to do it. I was         very surprised of price of it. It cost three hundreds and twenty nine american         dollars. It's make me little suppressed and disappointed I don't have so much         now. I was make application but I must pay for it. I asked my mother about         our savings she said that the money should not be a barrier between two people which love         each other. I counted my sum and I found out that I have only about fifty dollars and my         wages will be not soon. I asked my friends about helping me and they said that havn't it         at the present moment. I asked the advice my mother and she said that maybe you Dave can         help me because he loves me. I asked her how he can help me, because he is far         from me. My mother said that Dave can send the money through company which make this service.         I asked about it on my work and I know now that exists reliable and fast company which makes         remittances in world and it's called western union. I has remember that I saw advertising         this company on tv. I take a directory book and found the address of it and it's not far         from me. I went there and I asked them about service. They said that sender must go         to the western union branch, give them information: the name and last name         of receiver, country they make transfer and bring the ten digits secret code to         sender. The receiver must know ten digits for receiving money. They say that         the branches of it must be everywhere worldwide. Here is the information         about me: Country: Russia City: Syktyvkar Name: Anastasia Lastname: Fedorova         Address of branch of western union: SEVERNY NARODNY BANK PERVOMAISKAYA, 68 SYKTYVKAR,167000         phone: 7(821)2441931 I must know your full name, full address, your contact phone.         You must know Dave that I decide to ask you about it because I love you and trust you  very much. I decide to come to you because I feel this way and you are very         necessary to me, I decided to come to the unfamiliar country and I never be outside my         country. But I decided to do it because now you are part of my life and I trust         you in all. I think you trust me too and love me too. You must inform me the         closest airport to you I'll ask the help with ticket from my relatives. Please         don't forget to tell me the closest airport. My love Dave I need 289 dollars I         think you will help us because we found our love and we want to meet closer.         You must inform me ten digits and I can receive it. You must know Dave we         must hurry because I can receive the documents soon and if we lost the time         it is necessary for a long time. Now it's very difficultly to receive the         visa to your country, and it's fact, but if I pay now I think I do it. I think about sense         of money, and I'm very sad if this paper can prevent people to meet each         other. In most cases the money play a main role in life but it's not right! I'm         sure. And the quantity of money was and will not important to me I always         not aspired to material enrichment and don't search specially for rich man. I         appreciate human qualities and relations and I love you Dave!!! I love you all         my heart, I want to be with you now... I want to be with you forever. If it's         mutually we will be very happy in our life. I think you love me too and we will         meet very soon. You are my love Dave. My heart is yours. I'm waiting good         news from you, I hope everything will be all right and we will be together         soon. Every day I think about our meeting, and I think it's real, we must use         this chance of destiny. I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!  p.s. I send you photo special for         you it was made by my girlfriend (she loves photograph very much) I never         show it to anybody it's only for you. I love you!  Your love Anastasia.

<p>I of course never sent money, thanks to the info learned beforehand on this         site. Thank you. Dave

<p>Elena Orehova (Chelyabinsk City, Russia)

<p>Hello, my name is Mike I am 32 years old, single, with no children and I           live in Virginia.I wanted to tell you about my experience with a fraud.  I kind of found           out by accident.  I was looking to see if I could find a map with her street on it in           Chelyabinsk City.  So I typed the words "Chelyabinsk City 107 Darvina Street"           and hit search on my computer.  Was I shocked to find what I saw.  I saw the           same address but with another name.  It is on page 88 and she uses the name           Natalya/Natasha Komarova.  Elena used the email address of lenocha74@pochtamt.ru.  She also spoke of her           friends Tatyana and Kent. Tatyana met Kent from Canada on the internet.           Well, so she says.  All Elena did was write how Tatyana's experience in           finding a wonderful man on the internet was her motivation in wanting to           come to the USA and with me.  Luckily, I only blew $10.00 on her.  I had           spent $101.00 on roses but the very next day after I found your website,           the florist in Russian said no such person lived at that address.  They           were nice enough to refund $91.00 and only charge me $10.00 for delivery           fees.  There's another piece of irony in that she said to NEVER send her           anything because people steal mail regularly in Russia.  Now, I know the           real reason why she told me not to. Yes, my heart is broken but it could have been so           much worse.  Thank you SO much for your website. mike mikalsean@webtv.net
