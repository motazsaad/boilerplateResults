<p>It's Christmastime in the city

<p>A quick update before a longer essay-type post: I am stone-free! Yay!

<p>I had the lithotripsy on Tuesday the 19th, and I am told that the kidney stone was very soft and was completely pulverized by the sound waves. Huzzah! The stent came out at the same time. I was in some fairly minor discomfort due to the stent removal; the lithotripsy discomfort has been intermittent and mostly tolerable.

<p>My only recourse at this point is to drink lots of water; we'll never know about the composition of the stone, because it was so completely OBLITERATED that there isn't anything to analyze. (I must add that I find this minorly bogus -- I know I analyzed lots of crap in chem class that didn't have any visible chunks in it -- why can't they just spectroscope my urine?) Ah well.

<p>Thanks for all the many many well wishes! I am very happy to have a pain-free Christmas!
