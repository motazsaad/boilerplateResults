<h>Multiple Choice                 or Multiple Guess!?

<p>The strategies that we have covered thus far should                 be helpful in preparing you with the necessary knowledge needed                 to succeed with multiple choice exams. For students who lack essential                 learning skills or who fail to apply the kinds of active strategies                 we have been discussing, multiple choice exams are extremely difficult.                 Some students have even gone so far as to label themselves incapable                 of writing multiple choice exams effectively. Some have even taken                 the step of changing out of a major area of study to avoid having                 to take exams in this format. In probably the majority of cases,                 these extreme responses are unnecessary; these students would have                 done better to examine the way they were preparing and adjusted                 their style of learning and studying to equip themselves better                 for these often difficult exams. If you're having difficulty with                 multiple choice exams, you will probably want to do what you can                 to make your situation better.

<p>The reasons why these tests are so difficult have                 to do more with the structure of the exams than the level of difficulty                 of the material. Many students make the assumption that multiple                 choice exams are simple and do not require a rigorous approach to                 study. If you can understand not only how to prepare, but how to                 approach and analyze the structure of multiple choice questions,                 you will have a much clearer sense of how to take the guess work                 out of multiple choice exams. In terms of their structure, multiple                 choice exams have a few unsavoury characteristics: first, these                 tests typically have many questions to answer and the topics you                 studied are typically scrambled and shuffled; second, the ideas                 you learned about in class or in the text may be reworded in different                 ways: colloquially, technically, by example, or by analogy; third,                 very often the multiple choice test is not simple recognition of                 basic ideas but recognition of the answer to a reasoned problem. Your reasoning must make use of the learning from the course and                 may go beyond the material covered in class or require you to apply                 knowledge from the course. You may have to go beyond straight memorization                 to make an analogy or to solve a novel problem. You cannot just                 be familiar with the material; you must be able to write it down,                 talk about it, and analyze it

<p>In-test Strategies                 for Multiple Choice

<p>With all these characteristics, it is no wonder                 that multiple choice tests are both under-estimated by some students                 and revered by others. We begin with a series of in-test strategies                 and then apply these to a few example questions, highlighting the                 structure and purpose of each question. When appropriate, we mention                 additional preparation strategies that could be used to prepare                 for the questions:

<p>PREVIEW THE EXAM. As you browse through, take                     note of those questions which seem easier (i.e., those questions                     you think you can answer) and perhaps plan to skip those which                     seem harder, setting time limits, and getting settled; keep                     to time divisions for questions as they are usually equally                     weighted; (see In-test Strategies, page 20.)

<p>START WITH QUESTIONS YOU CAN ANSWER READILY.                     Don't waste time labouring over troublesome questions at the                     start. Be sure to get credit for items you know well.

<p>RECYCLE THROUGH THE TEST. Now try the questions                     you could not do on the first attempt. Sometimes the answer                     will occur to you simply because you are more relaxed after                     having answered other questions. Sometimes, too, your answer                     to one question provides a clue to the answer of another.

<p>SET GOALS FOR TIME AND PACE YOURSELF ACCORDINGLY.                     Allocate your time according to the relative worth of questions.                     Try to save a few minutes at the end for review and revision.                     Remember: your first answer may not always be your best answer.                     Change answers, but only if you have a good reason for doing                     so. For instance, changing an answer from, say, selection "b" simply because your response to the previous four questions                     was also "b" and you cannot believe that five questions                     in a row would have the same item as the correct response, is                     likely not a good reason; be flexible in your approach.

<p>READ THE QUESTIONS CAREFULLY: twice if necessary.                     Avoid jumping to conclusions about what you think the question                     asks.

<p>CIRCLE OR UNDERLINE KEY WORDS IN QUESTIONS.                     Multiple choice tests examine your ability to read carefully                     and thoughtfully as much as they test your ability to recall                     and reason. Watch for words like "all," "always," "never," "none," "few," "many," some," "sometimes." (see Descriptive Words, page                     13.)

<p>TRY TO RECALL A CONCEPT FROM MEMORY or think                     out the answer before looking at the options. Doing this successfully                     may help you "wade through" the alternatives and find                     a reasonable answer or choice.

<p>CONSIDER THE COVER-UP STRATEGY, whereby you                     read the question and try to answer it by recall before looking                     at the alternative answers;

<p>CONSIDER THE TRUE/FALSE LABEL STRATEGY whereby                     you label the alternative answers as true or false statements                     and then look for a pattern in the answers;

<p>SOMETIMES ALTERNATIVES DIFFER BY ONLY ONE                     OR TWO WORDS or in the order of one or two terms. These can                     seem very confusing. It helps sometimes to read the stem of                     the question (that's the question part) with an alternative                     while covering up the others. By methodically thinking through                     the alternatives this way, you may be able to make more sense                     of the options by labelling them true or false and eliminating                     those that don't correctly complete the question.

<p>USE THE HINT OF HIGHLY SIMILAR PAIRS -- this                     says that often the answer is imbedded in one of two very similar                     pairs and the "most correct" answer is often the one                     that correctly uses course terminology; consider the all or                     none of the above cues -- if two of the preceding alternatives                     are opposites then one of them and the all or none of the above                     choice is also wrong;

<p>BE PREPARED TO CHANGE YOUR ANSWER if you can                     determine a clear reason why your first response is incorrect                     -- many students report difficulties arising from changes that                     are made on the basis of nervous feelings;

<p>YOU MIGHT WANT TO TRY TO ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS                     FROM THE SAME SECTION OF THE COURSE to offset the mixing of                     questions inherent in the design of the test -- this demands                     care be taken that answer sheets are correctly completed and                     that all questions have been answered; consider guessing when                     there is no penalty for a wrong answer.

<p>BE ALERT TO TERMINOLOGY WHICH LINKS the alternatives                     or questions to key areas of the course, lectures, or chapters                     of a course's materials -- this may help you narrow the field                     of possible choices and think through to the best answer.

<p>BE WARY OF DESCRIPTIVE WORDS which are overly                     exclusive or overly inclusive. These absolute terms tend to                     portray things as right or wrong where this is often not the                     case. Words like always, never, completely, and only are absolutes.                     Relative words like often, usually, seem and may are often more                     accurate.

<p>TRANSLATE DOUBLE NEGATIVE STATEMENTS into                     positive ones. Examples like "Not lacking" or "not                     none" become "having" and "some" and                     this can reduce confusion. Note that these are often partly                     in the stem and partly in the choices of a particular question.

<p>IF YOU MUST GUESS, look for some of these                     possibilities: the style of an answer option is very different                     from all of the others - this may disqualify it; the grammar                     of the question stem is not in agreement with the grammar of                     an alternative; some alternative is not in the area or topic                     of the question, but comes from some other part of the course-                     this may disqualify it.

<p>OVERALL, remember that you are looking                     for the best answer, not only a correct one, and not one which                     must be true all of the time, in all cases, and without exception.

<p>Multiple Choice                 Question Practice

<p>To assist you in applying the strategies we have                 been talking about, we have included a set of example questions.                 Examine the example questions and the discussion that follows each.                 Look for how the questions have been developed and attend to the                 in-test and preparation strategies mentioned. By understanding how                 multiple choice test questions can be built from course notes, you                 may be better able to construct example questions of your own. And,                 these example questions should help you to better understand how                 to apply the skills that you have been learning throughout these                 web-pages.
