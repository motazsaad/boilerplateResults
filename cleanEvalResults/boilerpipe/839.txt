<p>Bed and chair? Do we really need them?

<p>I think you are a man of great humour! I really liked your style in which you put up your question. Ha! Ha! Ha!

<p>Well you are right this question is something that should be research into. But my reading would be in terms of hygiene and pure comfort. Both these riders are true to "civilization" and I guess both the bed and the chair are the best example and the most distorted would be the commode / a western W C. Ha! Ha! Ha!

<p>I think this topic calls for a light humoured response (alongwith some serious stuff) to liven up the entire discussion forum.

<p>Hey where are you from?

<p>CHEERS!

<p>Bed or raised platform came in to existence to get away from reptiles and such harmful organisms while asleep and chair is definetely better than squatting, as it helps one to get up fast. Both have been invented by human genious to make life and acts commfortable. Civilized human beings do use them as fashion statement since last few centuries.

<p>Hey Abdul, did you read my topic- Thinking Architecture and Is New Delhi ready for Olympics and my contribution to Are skyscraper the new vernacular, House and street etc. read through them and send me your response / observations... ummm?

<p>In fact I read through some other stuff that you wrote, and I observe that you are talking about realising that human genius and not just remain confined to stereotypes... Architecture is just one such expression, waiting to be realised further and truely.

<p>Dushyant, what makes you think that these little critters can't climb a bed or raised platform.

<p>Bed and chair? Do we really need them?

<p>It's not that they can't, but they won't. Reptiles, bugs, and other crawling critters don't really have as their life goal to end up in some human bodiliy cavity, but they can crawl inside accidently if a human lies sleeping on the ground. To such a small creature, our huge and motionless sleeping bodies may seem as part of natural topography. If they end somewhere they shouldn't, they will probably be as shocked as we are when we wake up. So, by raisinng ourselves over the ground by means of bed, human beings free the ground for a safe and undisturbed passage of small crawling animals. These things, though we may not like them, are living beings, after all, and have a right to crawl around where they want to without fearing to end in some nasty place.

<p>Bushmen, for instance, who up to this day sleep on the ground, sleep with their heads pushed upon their raised hand, with an ellbow fixed into the ground. They do this exactly so nothing crawling would enter their ears (or noses or mouths). This is a very uncomfortable position, so it is likely that people who got no sleep in this way decided to protect themselves from crawling things by raising themselves of the ground whilst sleeping, thus inventing beds.

<p>As a teenager I did a lot of outdoor activities. I had to sleep in the wild. Elders taught us to sleep without movement on the mattress on the ground. First it was strange to me. One day I had three reptile companions and realised the advice of elders that if you do not toss around in sleep, you do not bother them, nor do they trouble you. Elders taught us to get up from bed straight at such places so that, again, we do not disturb the visitors. Mankind has taken over, where are creatures in freedom? I have slept on a bed in the wild and reptiles have not bothered. Experience is the best teacher.

<p>Dushyant and Luka, thanks for your responses(good examples)but in both cases the need of a bed suits a natural enviroment, Mother Nature.  How can you explain the phenomenon in homes and especially in modern homes where it is much more difficult for a "critter" to get in.  Buildings are not part of a natural topography(although some are and some should be). In fact creatures of the wild tend to stay away from such unnatural things. If the problem of insects, lizards and wild animals are taken care of by the building itself than what excuse do we have to use raised beds. Don't get me wrong I am not anti-raised beds. Raised beds are a permanent fixture that exists in all cultures and peoples but the question really is a philosophical question of what are the ideals of man(for the politically correct "humans")?  I think raised beds, chairs, houses, cars, clothes, material things are all but  status symbols, transitory, serving no function except for some comfort and a false notion of glory. Dushyant, that picture of the lizard friends that came to visit you is beautiful. Seeing, experiencing and reflecting nature gives man a sense of peace and fullfillment, that man-made structures can only dream of. My question is I guess this. In what way can architecture be built to allow humans to experience nature, organically? Can it be done? Could we build natural enviroments inside a structure? Is there a solution that allows man to build and nature to exist? And "no" I am not a madman(altough some might think so), just trying to see if Architects have any sort of moral radar or sense of resposibility to what we do to our planet.

<p>Bed and chair? Do we really need them?

<p>Dear Abdul,

<p>For some time now, I've been contemplating that, should I someday be free to design my own house according to my own wishes, I would leave it completely free of any furniture whatsoever. The only element of interior design I'd employ would be a decent number of large, soft pillows which could be used both for sitting and for sleeping on. But I feel absolutely no need to use a designed bed over one improvised on the floor, especialy since, as you noted, modern homes are completely sterilised, highly hygienic units isolated from the natural environment. If we have already done so in order to produce a completely artificial 'safe heaven' for us, then I see absolutely no need to crample or hide the artifical beauty of vast, empty, closed spaces of this 'heaven' by large and more-less absolutely necessary inventory of furniture. Less is so much, much, more.

<p>So I say: bed and chair? Who needs them? You can sit, eat, sleep and do anything else you like on the floor, which today can be made as comfy and warm as any chair or bed. All we need to do is sometimes have the courage to break up with traditions or customs if we feel they hamper us.

<p>Best regards,

<p>Luka, you seem to be very bright. I hope the modern world won't dull your senses. I value your well written commentaries and take them to heart. I hope you continue to offer your insights. Take Care.

<p>Bed and chair? Do we really need them?

<p>Since I am very rational I don't find any humor in the bed and chair question!!

<p>But I found it essential to think deep about our environment. First, if you look to the meaning of the bed, it is a structure and it is linked to the civilized societies and it is linked to size and warmth at the same time. So, it depends on you how you define a bed in term of those components. For me, bed could be a group of pillows or two chairs or a sheet of rubber with adequate size or even the grass if not wet ...

<p>So, we need the bed and since we weak creatures seek perfection in form and in function even with our bodies shapes beds are developed by time and have many shapes and styles...

<p>Cheers,

<p>Idea of bed and chair comes into human mind as the idea of gravity comes into Newton,when apple falls on his head.

<p>Bed and chair? Do we really need them?

<p>Hi all,

<p>I think that you have got something going here. It is not the bed that we are discussing.  We are discussing taking old inventions for granted.  The bed was invented for some reason or the other however after all of this time we forgot the purpose of its invention and concentrated only on developing the design. Same for the wheel, table, chair, perfumes,......etc

<p>The reason was so obvious that we stopped discussing it and it was lost (to us) after several decades.
