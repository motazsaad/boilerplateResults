<p>Rock And Roll

<p>It's been a long time since I Rock and Rolled,

<p>It's been a long time since I did the Stroll.

<p>Ooh, let me get it back, let me get it back,

<p>Let me get it back, baby, where I come from.

<p>It's been a long time, been a long time,

<p>Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time.

<p>Yes it has.

<p>It's been a long time since the book of love,

<p>I can't count the tears of a life with no love.

<p>Carry me back, carry me back,

<p>Carry me back, baby, where I come from.

<p>It's been a long time, been a long time,

<p>Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time.

<p>Seems so long since we walked in the moonlight,

<p>Making vows that just can't work right.

<p>Open your arms, opens your arms,

<p>Open your arms, baby, let my love come running in.

<p>It's been a long time, been a long time,

<p>Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time.

<p>The Battle Of Evermore

<p>Queen of Light took her bow

<p>And then she turned to go,

<p>The Prince of Peace embraced the gloom

<p>And walked the night alone.

<p>Oh, dance in the dark of night,

<p>Sing to the morn - ing light.

<p>The dark Lord rides in force tonight

<p>And time will tell us all.

<p>Oh, throw down your plow and hoe,

<p>Rest not to lock your homes.

<p>Side by side we wait the might

<p>Of the darkest of them all.

<p>I hear the horses' thunder

<p>Down in the valley blow,

<p>I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon,

<p>Waiting for the eastern glow.

<p>The apples of the valley hold,

<p>The seas of happiness,

<p>The ground is rich from tender care,

<p>Repay, do not forget, no, no.

<p>Oh,-------danceinthedarkofnight,

<p>sing to the morning light.

<p>The apples turn to brown and black,

<p>The tyrant's face is red.

<p>Oh the war is common cry,

<p>Pick up you swords and fly.

<p>The sky is filled with good and bad

<p>That mortals never know.

<p>Oh, well, the night is long

<p>The beads of time pass slow,

<p>Tired eyes on the sunrise,

<p>Waiting for the eastern glow.

<p>The pain of war cannot exceed

<p>The woe of aftermath,

<p>The drums will shake the castle wall,

<p>The ring wraiths ride in black,

<p>Ride on.

<p>Sing as you raise your bow,

<p>Shoot straighter than before.

<p>No comfort has the fire at night

<p>That lights the face so cold.

<p>Oh dance in the dark of night,

<p>Sing to the mornin' light.

<p>The magic runes are writ in gold

<p>To bring the balance back.

<p>Bring it back.

<p>At last the sun is shining,

<p>The clouds of blue roll by,

<p>With flames from the dragon of darkness

<p>The sunlight blinds his eyes.

<p>Stairway To Heaven

<p>There's a lady who's sure

<p>All that glitters is gold

<p>And she's buying a stairway to heaven.

<p>When she gets there she knows

<p>If the stores are all closed

<p>With a word she can get what she came for.

<p>Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.

<p>There's a sign on the wall

<p>But she wants to be sure

<p>'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.

<p>In a tree by the brook

<p>There's a songbird who sings,

<p>Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.

<p>Ooh, it makes me wonder,

<p>Ooh, it makes me wonder.

<p>There's a feeling I get

<p>When I look to the west,

<p>And my spirit is crying for leaving.

<p>In my thoughts I have seen

<p>Rings of smoke through the trees,

<p>And the voices of those who standing looking.

<p>Ooh, it makes me wonder,

<p>Ooh, it really makes me wonder.

<p>And it's whispered that soon

<p>If we all call the tune

<p>Then the piper will lead us to reason.

<p>And a new day will dawn

<p>For those who stand long

<p>And the forests will echo with laughter.

<p>If there's a bustle in your hedgerow

<p>Don't be alarmed now,

<p>It's just a spring clean for the May queen.

<p>Yes, there are two paths you can go by

<p>But in the long run

<p>There's still time to change the road you're on.

<p>And it makes me wonder.

<p>Your head is humming and it won't go

<p>In case you don't know,

<p>The piper's calling you to join him,

<p>Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow,

<p>And did you know

<p>Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.

<p>And as we wind on down the road

<p>Our shadows taller than our soul.

<p>There walks a lady we all know

<p>Who shines white light and wants to show

<p>How ev'rything still turns to gold.

<p>And if you listen very hard

<p>The tune will come to you at last.

<p>When all are one and one is all

<p>To be a rock and not to roll.

<p>And she's buying a stairway to heaven.

<p>Misty Mountain Hop

<p>Walkin' in the park just the other day, Baby,

<p>What do you, what do you think I saw?

<p>Crowds of people sittin' on the grass with flowers in their hair said,

<p>"Hey, Boy, do you wanna score?"

<p>And you know how it is;

<p>I really don't know what time it was, woh, oh,

<p>So I asked them if I could stay awhile.

<p>I didn't notice but it had got very dark and I was really,

<p>Really out of my mind.

<p>Just then a policeman stepped up to me and asked us said,

<p>"Please, hey, would we care to all get in line,

<p>Get in line."

<p>They asked us to stay for tea and have some fun,

<p>Oh, oh, he said that his friends would all drop by, ooh.

<p>Why don't you take a good look at yourself and describe what you see,

<p>And Baby, Baby, Baby, do you like it?

<p>There you sit, sitting spare like a book on a shelf rustin'

<p>Ah, not trying to fight it.

<p>You really don't care if they're coming, oh, oh,

<p>I know that it's all a state of mind, ooh.

<p>If you go down in the streets today, Baby, you better,

<p>You better open your eyes.

<p>Folk down there really don't care, really don't care, don't care, really don't

<p>Which, which way the pressure lies,

<p>So I've decided what I'm gonna do now.

<p>So I'm packing my bags for the Misty Mountains

<p>Where the spirits go now,

<p>Over the hills where the spirits fly, ooh.

<p>I really don't know.

<p>Oh, Baby, it's cryin' time,

<p>Oh, Baby, I got to fly.

<p>Got to try to find a way,

<p>Got to try to get away,

<p>'Cause you know I gotta get away from you, Babe.

<p>Oh, Baby, the river's red,

<p>Oh, Baby, in my head.

<p>There's a funny feelin' goin' on,

<p>I don't think I can hold out long.

<p>*And when the owls cry in the night,

<p>Oh, Baby, Baby, when the pines begin to cry,

<p>Baby, Baby, Baby, how do you feel?

<p>If the river runs dry, Baby,

<p>How do you feel?

<p>Craze, Baby, the rainbow's end,

<p>Mmm, Baby, it's just a den

<p>For those who hide,

<p>Who hide their love to depths of life

<p>And ruin dreams that we all knew so, Babe.

<p>* Chorus

<p>Spent my days with a woman unkind,

<p>Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine.

<p>Made up my mind to make a new start,

<p>Going To California with an aching in my heart.

<p>Someone told me there's a girl out there

<p>With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair.

<p>Took my chances on a big jet plane,

<p>Never let them tell you that they're all the same.

<p>The sea was red and the sky was grey,

<p>Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today.

<p>The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake

<p>As the children of the sun began to awake.

<p>Seems that the wrath of the Gods

<p>Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;

<p>I think I might be sinking.

<p>Throw me a line if I reach it in time

<p>I'll meet you up there where the path

<p>Runs straight and high.

<p>To find a queen without a king;

<p>They say she plays guitar and cries and sings.

<p>La la la la

<p>Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn

<p>Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born.

<p>Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams,

<p>Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems.

<p>When The Levee Breaks

<p>If it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break,

<p>If it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break,

<p>When The Levee Breaks I'll have no place to stay.

<p>Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan,

<p>Lord, mean old levee taught me to weep and moan,

<p>Got what it takes to make a mountain man leave his home,

<p>Oh, well, oh, well, oh, well.

<p>Don't it make you feel bad

<p>When you're tryin' to find your way home,

<p>You don't know which way to go?

<p>If you're goin' down South

<p>They go no work to do,

<p>If you don't know about Chicago.

<p>Cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do you no good,

<p>Now, cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do you no good,

<p>When the levee breaks, mama, you got to move.

<p>All last night sat on the levee and moaned,

<p>All last night sat on the levee and moaned,

<p>Thinkin' 'bout me baby and my happy home.

<p>Going, go'n' to Chicago,

<p>Sorry but I can't take you.

<p>Going down, going down now, going down.
