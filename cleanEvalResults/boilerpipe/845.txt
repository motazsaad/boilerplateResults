<p>Hi!

<p>I really like your microwave oven page. If you put some pieces of magnesium shavings in your microwave and turn it on, it burns really bright and sends some fireballs out of it.

<p>Jeroen Domburg mailed me to tell that flash bulbs don't do much. They get hot but won't light up. He suggests that the voltage needed to light the bulb is a few kilo Volts and the microwave won't produce that much (I doubt that).

<p>He also confirms what I already tried that a LED won't do much eighter (just lights a little).

<p>I loved your microwave oven page so much that I just had to add something.  If you have the flat bottom microwave then try this.  Take some vegtable oil and grease the bottom of the microwave,  then take some grapes prefeably seedles, and line them up at one end of the microwave with the holes pointing towads the wall they are lined up againsed.  Turn the microwave on and see which one gets the farthest or gets to the other side fastest.  Sometimes the grape will just explode but that just adds to the fun.  You can make bets with your friends if you want.

<p>Hey. I saw your fun with microwaves page. I just want to say that if you fill a glass half full with water, and then put a lightbulb in that metal down it won't get that hot, and you can leave it in there longer.  The other thing is, and I have not tried it yet, but get an egg, put it in a microwave, turn it on, and run.  I have heard it will blow the door off your microwave.

<p>Just try a M&M (peanut) in a microwave. We did it and the thing sparks (one heck of a lot) and then catches light. Well it worked for me (several times!)

<p>Hi I saw your webpage and had to add something I like you am fascinated with Microwaves and I like seeing what happens to things when placed in a microwave!  A few days ago at school we decided to put a rasin in a microwave in the cookery room cos we had been told it would explode by one of our friends Ben BUT....it didn't what it did do was expand to about twice the size it first was, then it went on fire causing a terrible smell to waft around the school!! luckily we did this experiment at break time so none of the teachers knew who had done it I am soo glad we didn't do it during our actual cookery class our teacher would have gone ape shit!

<p>A comment on your experiments:

<p>Items such as the Neon Light don't need to be attached to aluminum foil. What you need is Metal (antenna) inside "inert gas" or "gas". The metal picks up the microwave energy, but because of the wavelength of micro-waves, there is a voltage potential between the parts of metal.

<p>The arcing betwen 2 points of metal / grape-halfs / etc is caused by the difference in the voltage potential causing the arking.

<p>Neon Lights will work for a long time and not get as hot if you cut the metal leads off of the bulb.  The metal inside the bulb will still act as an antenna, and the gas will still get excited / glow.

<p>I would think that a "Strobe Light" bulb would product brilliant white light. Phosphorus will glow brilliantly when excited.  This is what causes the flourescent light to glow (phosphorus on the inside of the glass)  I would not recommend sticking flourescent lights in the microwave though, since they contain mercury.  You don't want mercury inside your microwave since it will turn into a gas and get onto your food. I have heard that Pickle's glow, but I think that's just arcing through the salt-water inside the pickle since the salt makes it conductive.

<p>I wonder if the "Indiglo" part of an old watch would glow.  I think they are phosphorus based, so they should (if they don't burn)

<p>Love your microwave fun page. Not sure if this is fun because it scared the shit out of me.  Me and some friends were high once and we decided to go to the cliffs to eat.  We wanted some soup there so we got one of those ice-pack things and stuck it in the microwave.  We had it on high and set it for a few minutes.  By the way this was one of those nice ones that are thick plastic.  Anyways after about a half minute the thing exploded and blew the door litterally off the microwave.  So this is only cool to do if you are destroying a microwave.

<p>This is a follow-up to the guy who put an ice-pack in the microwave.  I would  highly recommend against doing that again, as the ingredient that lowers the  temperature is ammonium nitrate--a high order explosive.  I'm surprised that  he didn't kill himself.

<p>Try this one. Get a polaroid camera. Take a picture of something. Then quickly put it into the microwave for only a couple of seconds. The sparks will fly.Then take the picture out and check out the amazing colors that are produced.Try putting a drop of water on the picture and you will get some control over the burn. You will amaze your friends and have fun for hours! Another wonderful experiment.

<p>Also if you place two peeps (those yellow marshmallow easter candy things shaped like baby chicks) in the microwave facing each other, and stick two toothpicks in them, when you turn it on, the inflate and stab each other . . . peep jousting!

<p>Whatever you do, dont put a potato in the microwave with a papertowel around it, and then set it for 20 min. I did this on accident when I was younger (because i figged potatos in the microwave would be half as long as in the oven, and instead of foil, a paper towel)

<p>Oh the things you learn when you are young!

<p>(btw - it caught the whole stinking microwave on fire, totally distroyed)

<p>Thank you drive thru

<p>I'd like to do a fun interview with you on the radio in Toronto.

<p>I work at one of Canada's tp radio stations......If you or someone else who has tried this stuff would be interested please e mail me !

<p>Jim.richards@cfrb.com

<p>A: Unfortunately his show is at midnight and it is about 6:00 AM here at that time so I didn't do it.....

<p>Hi!

<p>There is a show here in Swden, ironically called "Wimans" that broadcasts on the channel ZTV. They make lot of different experiments. One of them is an egg in the micro. You requested a movie like that.. Hope this one will do.

<p>Sincerely /simonize

<p>Very cool page.

<p>A couple years ago I was reading up on ball lightning, and I found an article on producing it in microwave ovens. The effect is similar to the burning toothpick, but it can last for several minutes if a lit candle is used.  Every couple of seconds, the flame will flare up, and sometimes a small fireball will detach itself, float to the ceiling of the oven, and persist for several seconds. It's a spectacle, and it's probably safe -- but no guarantee (Do remember to check the candle for a metal base!  (Yes, remove it.)).

<p>I tried this once. The 3" candle got warm and burnt down in about 5 minutes. Aside from molten wax on the floor, there was no visible damage or staining inside the microwave, and it seemed to operate normally afterwards.

<p>I am not a tree (? :-)

<p>Seeing as how you are a microwave oven guru, I would like to ask a question. If you do not know the answer, maybe you would pass this along to any of your microwave oven cohorts.

<p>Q: If a manetron is removed from an oven and mounted so that the beam is projected in a horizontal manner, and a glass lens is mounted in the direction that the beam is projected so as to focus it, would it be possible to focus the beam on a distant object in order to heat it?

<p>A: I even have a remark placed on my page about this.

<p>First, the "beam" has an angle of almost 180 degrees so it will go all directions.

<p>Second, if this beam hits you it will do great damage to your body. If it hits your eyes you will go blind. This would be one of the first things that happens. Jeff Holmes added: The first thing is you can forget about having children because you will be sterile.

<p>Third, you cannot focus a microwave beam by a glass lens A glass lens is only suitable for electro magnetic waves in the visible frequency range. I don't know how to focus beams of 2.4 GHz.

<p>I would most certainly not do an experiment as you describe, really !

<p>A real nice technical explanation from Simon Wilson. A bit too long for here so I made a separate page of it.

<p>Ever look at the inside of a potato chip bag (like Lays or Doritos)? Notice the silver coating on the inside? Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Oh yes, and what a show. Almost as much sparking as a CD, all throughout the bag. And when it's over, the bag is actually miniaturized, you can still read the print and everything but it's TINY! Be careful, if you do this for too long the plastic gets overheaded and bubbles form and it kind of ruins it. 2-4 seconds should be enough for most modern medium-to-high powered microwaves. We melted one of each brand of bag from the vending machine at a store i used to work at and stuck them to the wall in a big collage while they where still hot! :-D Have fun!

<p>P.S. Eat the chips first, otherwise it gets messy ;-)

<p>I enjoyed your microwave page - glad to see it survived being slashdotted!

<p>I discovered this weekend that if you use your microwave to defrost a frozen chilli, two things happen:

<p>1) It flares up, much as you've described a toothpick flaring up, in pink and yellow;

<p>2) Your flatmate runs across the kitchen, shouting 'Make it stop!'

<p>Both rather amusing. If you want to recreate this effect, I should add that we used a smallish red chilli; it's possible that other types of chillies would produce other colours/effects.

<p>Cheers,

<p>Gareth Evans

<p>Tried this one in Jr. High Home Ec. class.

<p>Put a handful of straight pins (the kind with the colored plastic heads)(jumbled up, NOT neatly stacked) into the microwave.  I reccomend putting them on a glass plate because this will make a mess. Turn on the microwave and watch the fireworks and the plastic heads melting! Sparks shoot out of the pins(this is why you want them jumbled up, so the sparks will go in all different directions)

<p>We did this between classes. After that, there was always a colored lump in the middle of the microwave (we didn't use a plate).

<p>Mike Fischer

<p>Well, that's all for now folkes! As soon as I think of new experiments I'll let you know. Again, be carefull with these experiments and please let me know about them. I'm sure you can think of a lot of other nice tricks, so please email them to me .

<p>READ THIS: There used to be an email in here of someone who said he took the transmitter out of his moicrowave oven and then turned it on. This is really (and if I say really I do mean really :-) dangerous ! The radiation is coming out to almost the entire 180 degrees angle and it will almost sure hit your body with all negative consequences.... The first thing which will happen is that you go blind.....  So don't do that ! -Over and out-
