<h>V/O: A feeling of helplessness. Atop this broken-down  and hollowed-out old city wall.

<p>ZZC: How long do you feeling like spending up here?

<p>YW: Being like this... I could spend all day.

<p>ZZC: Would it be better if we walked somewhere else?

<p>YW: Whatever you'd like.

<p>ZZC: How come you never have an opinion?

<p>YW: Because it's up to you. You're the one who asked  me to go for a walk. I'll go wherever you want me to go.

<p>ZZC: You're not the same person you used to be.

<p>YW: Have I really changed?

<p>ZZC: No. Before the war, if I'd ask you to go with  me you'd say, `Whatever you like.' And if I didn't ask you to  go with me you'd still say `Whatever you like.'

<p>YW: Isn't that what I just said? But I didn't wait  for you. I didn't do `whatever you like.'

<p>ZZC: If I asked you to come away with me, would you  still say `whatever you like'?

<p>YW: Do you really mean that?

<p>* * *

<p>[cut to Liyan and Zhang Zhichen indoors]

<p>LY: How's my pulse? Is it OK?

<p>ZZC: It's fine.

<p>LY: Do you think I can really get better?

<p>ZZC: Of course you can get better.

<p>LY: What kind of medicine do you think I should take?

<p>ZZC: I think you should get plenty of rest and take  good care of yourself. That's the most important thing. Medicine  is secondary. And you musn't get angry.

<p>LY: You mean, at her?

<p>ZZC: Not necessarily at her.

<p>LY: I don't know why, but my temper has gotten worse  and worse.

<p>ZZC: That's because of your health.

<p>LY: My wife is as good a woman as you you'll ever find.  But all because of my health, our marriage has become abnormal.

<p>ZZC: There's nothing abnormal about it.

<p>LY: You don't know. All the things a wife ought to  do, she's done: grocery shopping, cooking, taking care of the  house. I'm grateful to her but also so ashamed that she's so  kind to a husband as sickly as myself. Of course, I'm unable  to cry. Nor can I laugh. She cries all alone in her room and  never smiles in front of other people. She just does her duty  to me. She's cold. The kinder she is to me, the more I feel that  she's cold. Do you understand what I mean?

<p>ZZC: I understand. But I disagree with you on one point.

<p>LY: What's that?

<p>ZZC: She's not cold.

<p>LY: We've been friends for so many years now. Can you  talk to her for me? I had no idea that you two actually knew  each other. It would have been better if she had married you  instead.

<p>ZZC: Don't say such sad things

<p>* * *

<p>[cut to Yuwen and Zhichen talking]

<p>YW: I'm not this way with him because you came. I know  that Liyan is good to me. That year when we got married, I forced  myself to like him. Later, after he got sick, he became more  and more eccentric, and I felt empty, at a loss. All I could  do was think of you. After a year or two, Liyan became something  like a responsibility that I had inherited, he became my husband.  I serve him. I have to serve him faithfully. My heart is yours.  But I feel sorry for Liyan. What would you have me do?

<p>ZZC: What would you have me do?

<p>YW: What are we going to do?

<p>ZZC: Unless we...

<p>ZZC: I leave...

<p>YW: Unless he dies...oh!

<p>V/O: I regret it. I've never even thought that to myself,  so how could I actually have said it?

<p>* * *

<p>DX: Big brother Zhang! Big brother Zhang! Big brother  Zhang! Big brother Zhang! 

<p>V/O: Another Sunday. The ninth day since he arrived.

<p>DX: Big brother Zhang! 

<p>DX: Brother.

<p>LY: What are you shouting for?

<p>DX: It's Sunday. I'm looking for Big brother Zhang  so that I can ask him to go out and do something fun.

<p>LY: So you like spending time with Big brother Zhang?  He's inside. Why are you shouting for him in here?

<p>DX: How should I know where he's gone?

<p>LY: Don't shout so loud. It doesn't sound proper.

<p>DX: Well, if you run into him, tell him I was looking  for him. Thanks.

<p>[enter Zhichen]

<p>ZZC: Liyan...

<p>LY: Oh, so you are out here after all. Didn't you hear my sister calling you?

<p>ZZC: Liyan, I'm leaving.

<p>LY: What's this? You say you want to leave again?

<p>ZZC: I've been here too long already. It's too much trouble for you.

<p>LY: No, that won't do. You have to stay. Come on inside. My sister's looking for you. Come on, why don't you take her out to have some fun?

<p> 

<p>[Cut to Zhichen and Dai Xiu on the city wall]

<p>ZZC: One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four.  One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Good, good.

<p>ZZC: I had no idea you were so good at singing and  dancing. You don't seem like a product of the Dai family. Does  your brother approve? 

<p>DX: He doesn't approve but he doesn't disapprove either.  But I think he really wants me to be a bookworm, studying at  home all day long.

<p>ZZC: It seems that you all like to come up to the top  of the city wall. Why's that?

<p>DX: This is the only interesting place in town. You  can walk along the wall forever and when you look so far into  the distance that you can't see anything at all you start to  realize that the world isn't so small after all. You know, Big  brother Zhang, in a small town like this, and especially with  a family like ours, you could suffocate to death. Take Big Sister:  everyday when she's done with the grocery shopping, she walks  on the city wall. Maybe that's the only way she can let go a  little and it's only after she lets go that she finds the courage  to go on. Big brother Zhang? What are you thinking about? Did  you hear a word I just said?

<p>ZZC: I heard you.

<p>DX: So what are you thinking about?

<p>ZCC: I was just thinking that maybe you'll become a  poet or a philsopher when you grow up.

<p>DX: Nonsense! Who knows what you were really thinking  about. But I was thinking that after I graduate I'd like to go  to Shanghai and and study in a high school there. Do you think  you could help me find a school, Big brother Zhang?

<p>ZZC: Huh?

<p>DX: Do you think you could help me find a school?

<p>ZZC: Oh. Sure.

<p>[cut to Yuwen in the courtyard]

<p>DX: We had a great time. I'm all sweaty.

<p>YW: Really?

<p>DX: See you later, Big Brother Zhang.

<p>ZZC: You didn't go out?

<p>YW: Nowhere to go.

<p>ZZC: Are you a little angry?

<p>YW: No.

<p>ZZC: Let's talk about it.

<p>YW: I'll come tonight.

<p>[cut to Yuwen and Zhichen in the studio]

<p>ZZC: Promise me something. Never come to see me again  behind Liyan's back, OK?

<p>YW: I have something on my mind. I have to ask you  something.

<p>ZZC: What is it?

<p>YW: Where did you two go today?

<p>ZZC: On top of the city wall.

<p>YW: Was it nice?

<p>ZZC: You're the one who showed it to me.

<p>YW: It seems that you and sis are getting very close.

<p>ZZC: I watched her grow up. 

<p>YW: She's sixteen this year.

<p>ZZC: Still a child.

<p>YW: She's a child and yet you take her around with  you to all sorts of places. Do you two think you're fooling anyone?

<p>ZZC: What's that supposed to mean? I don't understand.

<p>YW: She's Liyan's little sister. I'm his wife. I'm  responsible for her.

<p>ZZC: Then I won't take her out anymore.

<p>YW: After I go back, I'll tell Liyan that I came to  talk with you. I wouldn't want to do anything behind his back.  See you tomorrow...I was just playing with you. Don't be mad.

<p>* * *

<p>[cut to Yuwen in Liyan's room]

<p>LY: Sit down. We have to talk.

<p>YW: What do you have to say?

<p>LY: What do you think of Zhichen?

<p>YW: What do you mean by asking me that?

<p>LY: Don't ask questions. Just tell me what you think of him.

<p>YW: Any friend of yours must be a good man.

<p>LY: Oh no. He's a much better man than I.

<p>YW: Why bring him up?

<p>LY: Sis is sixteen this year.

<p>YW: Oooh.

<p>LY: So now you understand. I want her to wait a couple of years for Zhichen.

<p>YW: You mean, you want to have Zhichen wait a couple of years for her.

<p>LY: Right. Let Zhichen wait a couple of years for sis.

<p>YW: But is sis willing?

<p>LY: That's why I wanted to ask you to talk it over with her. I'm her big brother. It would be a little awkward for me to bring it up.

<p>YW: You mean, you want me to play matchmaker?

<p>LY: Just talk it over with her first.

<p>YW: What about Zhichen?

<p>YW: Do you want me to talk it over with him as well?

<p>LY: Of course, I can talk with him myself.

<p>YW: Zhichen might not want to wait that long...

<p>LY: Does he have someone else in mind? He seems to get on very well with sis.

<p>YW: Oh?

<p>LY: It seems like a perfect set-up.

<p>YW: So that's how you see it. Your little sister is still young, though, still in school. Do you really want to fill her head with this kind of notion at this point? I don't want to talk to her about this.

<p>LY: Just test the waters...

<p>YW: There's always time later.

<p>LY: Very well.

<p>YW: It's getting late. Go to bed. You're really not taking the sleeping pills anymore?

<p>LY: No, not anymore.

<p>YW: Then I'll see you tomorrow.

<p>LY: Please don't go...

<p>[cut to Yuwen and Zhichen]

<p>ZZC: Morning.

<p>YW: Morning.

<p>ZZC: [clears throat]

<p>YW: when you're done with breakfast, come up with an  excuse so that you can meet me on the city wall.

<p>ZZC: What for?

<p>YW: What do you mean?

<p>ZZC: You're...you're going grocery shopping now?

<p>* * *

<p>YW: He wants me to play matchmaker for you.

<p>ZZC: Matchmaker?

<p>YW: Don't you get along quite nicely with his little  sister?

<p>ZZC: Ha. Ha.

<p>YW: So you think it's funny? I've been assigned a task  and I'm going to do my utmost to carry it out. I've told you  the proposal and now it's up to you to think about it and let  me know if you're willing to go through with it.

<p>ZZC: You're joking, right?

<p>YW: I'm perfectly serious.

<p>ZZC: I'm telling you this whole thing is a joke. Has  Liyan considered just how young his little sister is?

<p>YW: Today is her sixteenth birthday.

<p>ZZC: Oh. The year I left, weren't you just sixteen  years old? But we didn't have anyone to act as our matchmaker.

<p>YW: You seem to be implying that a sixteen year old  girl really is old enough to be engaged after all. Are you willing?

<p>ZZC: No, I'm not. I'm telling you that I am not willing.  Are you satisfied? Yuwen, I'm begging you. Stop pushing me, stop  torturing me. I've had enough. How I regret that back then I  didn't even know to arrange for a matchmaker.

<p>YW: Why didn't you know? Weren't you willing back then?  Why didn't you?

<p>ZZC: I was willing.

<p>YW: Then why didn't you?

<p>ZZC: Wasn't it that your mother disapproved?

<p>YW: But she's dead now.

<p>ZZC: But you already have a husband.

<p>YW: I suppose if Liyan gives you his sister, it'll  be the next best thing.

<p>ZZC: [sighs]

<p>YW: I have my own conflicts. I don't know if I want  to go away with you anyway...

<p>ZZC: Yuwen...

<p>[cut to Dai Xiu's birthday party]

<p>ZZC: It's your sixteenth birthday. You should drink  some wine.

<p>DX: Who's going to toast me?

<p>ZZC: I will.

<p>DX: But I don't want to drink. I'll just eat more food.  Big Sister made so many nice dishes for me today.

<p>ZZC: What about playing guess-fingers [a drinking game].

<p>DX: Big brother tried to teach me but I still don't  know how.

<p>LY: Go ahead, try it out.

<p>DX: OK, I'll play.

<p>[Zhichen and Dai Xiu play]

<p>DX: Is that how you play?

<p>[Dai Xiu loses]

<p>DX: I don't want to play anymore!

<p>ZZC: But you have to drink the forfeit.

<p>DX: Big Brother!

<p>LY: I'll drink it for you.

<p>ZZC: You can't drink that.

<p>YW: I'll drink it.

<p>DX: I don't want to play that game anymore. Let's play  something else.

<p>ZZC: OK.

<p>ZZC: Liyan, you've been to Sichuan. Let's play the  game Sichuan style.

<p>LY: You mean like this?

<p>[Zhichen and Liyan play]

<p>LY: I really can't drink wine?

<p>ZZC: I'll drink it for you.

<p>LY: Lao Huang, Lao Huang, why don't you have a drink?

<p>[Yuwen drinks the wine]

<p>LH: The young miss knows how to drink?

<p>LY: Can you drink wine?

<p>ZZC: Sure she can.

<p>[Zhichen, Liyan, and Lao Huang play]

<p>DX: Oh! Lao Huang wins!

<p>YW: This is your birthday. I should toast you properly too.

<p>DX: Then I'll have some too. Yuck. Big Brother...

<p>YW: [to ZZC] I'll play a game with you. Not guess fingers or rock scissors paper, but the one that goes like this, and this, and this.

<p>DX: I know that game too!

<p>ZZC: We always played that together back home.

<p>[Zhichen and Yuwen play]

<p>YW: Hold on. Let's switch to bigger cups! Lao Huang, bring bigger cups!

<p>DX: Lao Huang, bigger cups!

<p>YW: This time we'll play three rounds. Whoever loses has to drink three cups.

<p>DX: Three big cups!

<p>YW: You lose. Let's go again.

<p>[Liyan walks away in discomfort. Zhichen and Yuwen play again.]

<p>DX: You lose.

<p>YW: Drink up!

<p> 

<p>[Cut to Yuwen lying on her bed. Dai Xiu and Zhichen sing a  popular song off-camera]

<p>ZZC: Oh... so that's where you are.

<p>[Zhichen sings popular song to Yuwen, as Dai Xiu looks on]

<p>DX: Big Brother Zhang!

<p>[Yuwen walks to the studio]

<p>YW: Let me go in!

<p>All I have is regret. I want to die. I can no longer face  the world. He remembers that Liyan has some sleeping pills.
