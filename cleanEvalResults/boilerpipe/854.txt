<h>all lyrics written by Kate Bush

<p>Out on the wiley, windy moors

<p>We'd roll and fall in green

<p>You had a temper, like my jealousy

<p>Too hot, too greedy

<p>How could you leave me?

<p>When I needed to possess you

<p>I hated you, I loved you too

<p>Bad dreams in the night

<p>They told me I was going to lose the fight

<p>Leave behind my wuthering, wuthering

<p>Wuthering Heights

<p>Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy come home

<p>I'm so cold, let me in-a-your window

<p>Oh it gets dark, it gets lonely

<p>On the other side from you

<p>I pine a lot, I find the lot

<p>Falls through without you

<p>I'm coming back love, cruel Heathcliff

<p>My one dream, my only master

<p>Too long I roam in the night

<p>I'm coming back to his side to put it right

<p>I'm coming home to wuthering, wuthering

<p>Wuthering Heights

<p>Oh let me have it, let me grab your soul away

<p>Oh let me have it, let me grab your soul away

<p>You know it's me, Cathy

<p>(her first hit in 1978)

<p>How I'm moved, how you move me

<p>With your beauty's potency

<p>You give me life, please don't let me go

<p>You crush the lily in my soul

<p>from  "Moving"

<p>The candle burning over your shoulder

<p>Is throwing shadows from your saxophone

<p>A surly lady in tremor

<p>The stars that climb from her bowels

<p>Those stars make towers on vowels

<p>You'll never know that you had all of me

<p>You'll never see the poetry you've stirred in me

<p>Of all the stars I've seen that shine so brightly

<p>I've never known or felt, in myself, so rightly

<p>from "Saxophone Song"

<p>Soul birds of a feather flock together

<p>from "Strange Phenomena"

<p>And then I find out, when I take a good look up

<p>There's a hole in the sky with a big eyeball

<p>Calling me

<p>I'm like a feather on the wind

<p>Well I'm not sure if I want to be up here at all

<p>And I'd like to be back on the ground

<p>But I don't know how to get down

<p>from "Kite"

<p>I hear him before I go to sleep

<p>And focus on the day that's been

<p>I realise he's there when I turn the light off

<p>And turn over

<p>Nobody knows about my man

<p>They think he's lost on some horizon

<p>And suddenly I find myself

<p>Listening to a man I've never known before

<p>Telling me about the sea

<p>All his love, 'till eternity

<p>from "The Man With The Child In His Eyes"

<p>All the colours look brighter now

<p>Everything they say seems to sound new

<p>Slipping into tomorrow too quick

<p>Yesterday always too good to forget

<p>Stop the swing of the pendulum, let us through!

<p>from "Oh To Be In Love"

<p>You came out of the night

<p>Wearing a mask in white colour

<p>My eyes were shining on the wine

<p>And your aura

<p>The thoughts of you sends me shivery

<p>I'm dressed in lace sailing down a black reverie

<p>from "L'Amour Looks Something Like You"

<p>I must work on my mind

<p>For now I realize that everyone of us

<p>Has a heaven inside

<p>They open doorways that I thought were shut for good

<p>They read me Gurdjieff and Jesu

<p>They build up my body

<p>Break me emotionally, it's nearly killing me

<p>But what a lovely feeling!

<p>I love the whirling of the Dervishes

<p>I love the beauty of rare innocence

<p>You don't need no crystal ball

<p>Don't fall for a magic wand

<p>We humans got it all

<p>We perform the miracles

<p>Lost in your men and the games you play

<p>Trying to prove that you're better, woman

<p>But you needn't get heavy with them

<p>Like it or not, we were build tough

<p>Because we're woman

<p>No, we never die for long

<p>While we've got that little life to live for

<p>Where it's hid inside, no, we never die for long

<p>Oh-woman, two in one

<p>There's room for a life in your womb, woman

<p>Inside of you, can be two, woman

<p>from "Room For The Life"

<p>I've pulled down my lace and the chintz

<p>Oh, do you know you have the face of a genius

<p>I'll send your love to Zeus

<p>Oh, by the time you read this

<p>I'll be well in touch

<p>I'm giving it all in a moment or two

<p>I'm giving it all in a moment for you

<p>I'm giving it all

<p>Giving it, giving it, giving it

<p>This kicking here inside makes me leave you behind

<p>No more under the quilt to keep you warm

<p>Your sister I was born, you must lose me

<p>Like an arrow shot in the killer storm

<p>You and me on the bobbing knee

<p>Didn't we cry at that old mythology he'd read

<p>I will come home again, but not until

<p>The sun and moon meet on yon hill

<p>"The Kick Inside"

<p>(really beautiful song .... about incest

<p>I admire Kate's lyrical courage, and talent)

<p>I spend a lot of my time looking at blue

<p>The colour of my room and my mood

<p>Blue on the walls

<p>Blue out of my mouth

<p>The sort of blue

<p>Between clouds when the sun comes out

<p>The sort of blue

<p>In those eyes you get hung up about

<p>The more I think about sex

<p>The better it gets

<p>Here we have a purpose in life

<p>Good for the blood circulation

<p>Good for releasing the tension

<p>The root of our reincarnations

<p>from "Symphony In Blue"
