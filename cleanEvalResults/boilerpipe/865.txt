<h>Because it's too scary, because its too frightening, because its too explicit?

<p>President Festus Mogae:

<p>No because people are aware that if you contact Aids you die. If they didn't think so there would be no stigma.

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>So are people just ignoring the dangers then? Are they saying I don't want to think about it?

<p>President Festus Mogae:

<p>It seems to be the case. I am telling you what we are doing so tell me what you think what else we ought to be doing because if I thought something would work I would be trying it already. If you think I am not doing it, it is because I haven't thought of it.

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>Let's go now to another caller - Grace A Owuor, is on the line from Washington, USA. Grace what's your question to President Mogae?

<p>Grace Owuor:

<p>Thank you so much for your ground breaking decision. I'm originally from Kenya and I grew up here in the United States and most of my young days I spent in Kenya. I have an aunt who died of Aids about six or seven years ago and I completely agree with the stigma being the key issue that it's keeping a lot of the progress needed against the Aids pandemic.

<p>My question is more geared towards the children. I was of course reading about Botswana's 35% Aids infection rate and that of course hit me that the numbers of children who are being orphaned is very huge.  You mentioned 80% in the article that I saw in the BBC. I just want to know what is being done to incubate these children? Because as we've seen throughout Africa, Liberia and different parts of our continent, a lot of these rebels are children and often some of them may be victims of parents who've passed away as a result of Aids.

<p>In Kenya we have what are called small community based organisations called Grandmothers for Orphans. Because as you know when children's parents pass away it's left to either their grandmothers, uncles and aunts to support them. I'm just wondering if you have those types of organisations and if you thought about having some sort of a social system to support those organisations if they exist? That was my first question.

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>Let's put that to President Mogae and then we'll come back to your other question. President Mogae what is the situation with Aids orphans here in Botswana?

<p>President Festus Mogae:

<p>All orphans are registered. Of course to start with we're seeing Aids orphans, we changed that because in any case 30% of the orphans are orphaned because of road accidents.  Also we thought that calling them Aids orphans is stigmatising in the children. So we have registered 41,000 orphans to date. They are entitled to support from government - food rations, clothing, everything that they need.

<p>Those of them who are HIV positive are entitled to antiretrovirals free. But beyond that, we have the prevention of mother to child transmission, so that expectant mothers who attend the antenatal clinics are tested. And if they agree, they are then put on a programme so that they are given antiretrovirals for a few weeks before delivery and a few weeks after and then the child is also given AZT and nevirapine. So that in fact 60% of the children now born of HIV positive mothers don't have the virus - government support starts there. We provide infant formula and we now encourage the mothers - depending how advanced their situation is - not to breastfeed, which is a reversal of our policy. We have been encouraging breastfeeding - now we are saying it's better if you don't breastfeed.

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>It's too dangerous to breastfeed.

<p>President Festus Mogae:

<p>Too dangerous.

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>Let me go quickly back to Grace and Grace had one more question I believe, Grace what was your second question?

<p>Grace Owuor::

<p>Yes sir, this is a little bit off but it's kind of relevant to the subject. My question was you know in most countries and throughout the world there are deaf people. I'm wondering how communities are communicating with deaf people about - especially in the rural areas - about those who are dying around them and if they are aware of the Aids virus and if there's a way in which the government communicates to people who have illnesses that prevent them from communicating well and may be actually infected?

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>Thanks for that Grace. President?

<p>President Festus Mogae:

<p>Well we use our best endeavours to communicate but obviously in the more remote areas one can't guarantee that the communication is as effective as it is around town. Because in the towns there are schools - there are two institutions for deaf people and therefore we're able to communicate with them through sign language and others, there are social workers, not enough of them of course, who are trained in sign language. But in a country, in a developing country about the size of Kenya and a population of 1.7 million people there are lot of remote areas where some of the things that are happening in the bigger settlements will probably not be reaching these communities as well as they should.

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>Let's widen the discussion out a little bit. We've received an e-mail from Jason Jeffery in Zimbabwe, a neighbouring country to yours. Jason says: Is the fight against HIV in your country threatened by the continuing rise of illegal immigrants from Zimbabwe due to the growing political crisis there? Is this one of the justifications for the increased levels of security along the border? How would you answer that?

<p>President Festus Mogae:

<p>That's a difficult one because it's likely to be misunderstood, I mean to the extent that there are illegal immigrants. We hire a lot of Zimbabwean professionals. I said earlier to somebody that we are dependent on African professionals and we hire a great many people from Zimbabwe with skills. But there are of course in addition - there are a lots of skilled and unskilled workers who come into the country illegally. We send about a thousand back every week but they come right back. Well to the extent that these people are living uncertain lives and so on, I don't think they're helping the situation.

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>Do you think they're actually bringing HIV into the country?

<p>President Festus Mogae:

<p>Well no we find HIV here. There's HIV in Zimbabwe, in Zambia and in Botswana, so how can I say they are bringing HIV here when there is HIV here and in South Africa? It's in the region as a whole. The only difference is that - the only reason why we are different is that we were the first to explain to the rest of the world that we are more seriously affected. So it's not the Zimbabweans.

<p>He asked about security measures. Well there are a lot of social problems and whenever there is a rural urban migration, as happens in all developing countries, all African countries, and other developing countries, that tends to breed crime in the urban areas and to the extent that there are illegal immigrants, they would tend to exacerbate, not cause, exacerbate a problem that already is there. And so I hope that the people of Zimbabwe and everybody will understand and yes, illegal immigration tends to exacerbate already existing problems - whether it's crime or whether it's HIV/Aids or STDs in general.

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>Mr President you mentioned earlier the efforts in Uganda. We actually have a caller on line Job from Kampala in Uganda. Job what's your question to President Mogae?

<p>Job:

<p>I want to welcome the President to the programme and I want to thank him for appearing on the programme to address this particular issue of Aids. We know it has been around for quite some time, I don't know at what rate it has been multiplying, I don't have these statistics at hand because it has been around - at least it was here in the 80s when I was a teenager and now I'm in my thirties.

<p>In the late '90s that's when it exploded so much in Uganda and apparently in Kenya. And then currently in Uganda apparently they are reporting on seeing that the rate at which it is multiplying has gone down and in Kenya it seems to have exploded much more.  I don't know what's happening in other nations that are not African. But according to the little I hear about like China it's not doing so well in that area of Aids.

<p>So one thing I wanted his Excellency maybe to talk about is by politicians coming into this, do they really help the spread to go down or they just try and maybe publicise it so that the nation knows that it is there? The input I wanted to put in was that the solution to AIDS to me I feel like it doesn't lay with the politicians at all, politicians just take credit like our president in Uganda takes credit. Like he throws in the Aids infection has gone down but I doubt whether that is the case. Politicians don't take any credit in this one particular thing at all, maybe people just got to know about it because the presidents are talking about it. Do they lead the population? Are they also showing the population that this is how I am living and I'm living in a moral way so that Aids is not spreading? Do they give a moral leadership in that that particular issue?

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>Alright, let me put that then to the President. Also let me put to you another e-mail we've received, in fact from Michael in Uganda who says: How can his Excellency explain the fact that Botswana with its high GDP has not been able to set up a front in the field of research on Aids vaccine in Africa? Questions really there about political leadership. Let's deal first then with Job's question - do you think politicians can really make a difference?

<p>President Festus Mogae:

<p>Well I think they should endeavour to make a contribution. Certainly one contribution they can make, they can use the state machinery and make their own effort to let the population know the situation in which the particular country is in. The majority of people in the world feel that we African leaders have not done enough. They also said we have been silent about the pandemic etc. etc. and may be it is true but that was partly because of our invasion by the virus was by stealth given its very nature. So that by the time we became aware the predicament in which we were it was perhaps too late.

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>Well the warnings came from a long time ago - even the late 1980s, mid 1980s, it was apparent that some countries in Africa were suffering very badly.

<p>President Festus Mogae:

<p>Well beginning with Uganda itself  but that's what happens. So he was saying that he thinks that politicians are irrelevant - no I don't think they are irrelevant. I think everybody has a role to play, even if it's only to warn the nation of the problem. Church people have a role to play and thus other people also have roles to play.

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>What about the science question? What about the setting up the search for a vaccine, which is what Michael was asking about?

<p>President Festus Mogae:

<p>We have one of the leading laboratories here which we built and it's being operated by the Harvard Aids Institute. You could go and have a look at it - a lot of people know about it. There is a great deal of research now - there are at least half a dozen institutes who are doing research here in the country. We're being helped in our fight against HIV/Aids by a lot of the international community - UNAIDS, the Gates Foundation, the Merck Campaign Foundation and information is being exchanged freely left and right. But we are small country with a very small pool of scientists. But a great many scientists from abroad are working on the problem here. In fact right now tests of a vaccine are taking place.

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>On this issue of leadership then, let me read you out an e-mail we've received from Yahya Mohamed in the United States. Yahya says: What has motivated you in the fight against Aids as your neighbour, Mr Mbeki, president of South Africa, denies the veracity of Aids? Clearly there is an issue in South Africa about it but do you take any notice of that, do you take any influence from that?

<p>President Festus Mogae:

<p>No, the President of South Africa has his views and has his advisors. It's a much bigger country with a much larger pool of professionals and he has a great deal of professional advice at his disposal, which I don't have. And here the evidence of the existence of Aids is apparent for all to see and therefore I would be stating the obvious.

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>Do you think he's wrong?

<p>President Festus Mogae:

<p>No I don't know.

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>Okay let's take another call then from Reginal Mpolokeng in Accra, Ghana. Reginal, what's your question to President Mogae?

<p>Reginal Mpolokeng:

<p>Mr President, I really want to applaud you for the great work that you are doing to combat the Aids scourge in Botswana. My question is focussed on pregnant women.

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>I think the line is breaking up from Accra.  But I think the point he was making was about ARVs - antiretrovirals - being available for pregnant women, and also the issue of compulsory testing - is it compulsory for pregnant women in this country to be tested?

<p>President Festus Mogae:

<p>No it's not. We have an organisation, a multi-sectoral committee, called the National Aids Council which I chair and it has sub-committees. One sub-committee is on men - the men sub-committee - because of the feeling, as somebody alleged earlier on, is that the men are responsible for the spread of the disease. So we have a sub-committee of men on Aids. What they should be doing as fathers and as husbands and brothers and just as free agents. That's one.

<p>Now we also have a law and ethics committee - everything we do has to be subjected to a debate by the law and ethics committee. We have decided that to make the testing for HIV routine in medical facilities. But we can't make it compulsory because the advice of the law and ethics committee is that that would be a violation of the constitution and a violation of people's human rights.

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>But some people might say that in the instance of a pregnant woman, there's another individual whose human rights are at stake which is the unborn child. Do they not have the right to see if the mother is HIV positive and then get the necessary treatment that might stop them perhaps having HIV?

<p>President Festus Mogae:

<p>Yes but they will say that the woman who is expecting is the person with whom we can communicate and it will be she we will be forcing either to test or to undergo ARV therapy. So the testing is going to be routine from the 1st of January, unless the person opts out but it is not compulsory.

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>Let me read you out an e-mail we've received from Gunnar Zachrisen in Norway. Gunnar says: Do you consider the UNAIDS estimates to be exaggerated because from national samples the pregnant women, for example, seem to give a lower level of HIV infection compared to the UN estimates? Do you think that there is a discrepancy?

<p>President Festus Mogae:

<p>Yes there is consistently a discrepancy. The UN give a higher figure. We don't want to argue about the levels because supposing it's 50, it's too high, it's 25, it's too high, they said 35, it's too high, it's 45, it's too high. Therefore, we think the debate about statistics will be sterile. The problem is that HIV/Aids cuts across everything that we are trying to do as a nation, as a small nation. Before the advent of the epidemic we had attained human development indices that were quite impressive. Things like social indicators, like life expectancy, like the infant mortality, the mortality of under fives, mortality and morbidity. All of these indicators were very favourable, they were going down, now they are being reversed by HIV/Aids and therefore whatever - whether it's 25 or 30 it doesn't matter.

<p>But the research is there. We have surveys on which we rely. The women are attending antenatal clinics. We persuade them to test and we take these surveys and they indicate the percentages. But if somebody else, some other - as I said there are various groups here doing research - if somebody else receives a different figure really what you gain by arguing that's not right, it's 22% not 33 or not 30? Do you have the order of magnitude?

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>Let's take another call now from Umaru Fofana in Sierra Leone. Umaru what's your question for President Mogae?

<p>Umaru Fofana:

<p>Hi, good afternoon Roger, good afternoon Your Excellency. One thing that we have come to know lately is the fact that politicians most often are accused of making promises or just paying lip services to issues that are affecting various people of various countries. In this regard several governments, or some governments, have actually come forward in this fight against HIV/Aids and one thing which has been known to be a fine way of tackling the disease is by knowing each other's HIV status.

<p>Would it be a good idea, Mr President, do you think, if government officials, particularly the president and ministers, come out publicly and undergo an HIV/Aids test, thereby encouraging their people to come forward and carry out the test themselves?

<p>President Festus Mogae:

<p>That has been happening. For instance here it has been happening recently but whether it will have the impact we don't know. But I think it's a good thing for people to test.

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>Do you think it will actually make a difference if public figures do that?

<p>President Festus Mogae:

<p>I don't know whether it will or not.

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>Okay, Umaru why do you think it would make such a big difference, we've been talking about the importance of leadership, do you really think it would make a big difference?

<p>Umaru Fofana:

<p>Absolutely, I think it would make a big difference and I think one reason for the success in the fight against HIV/Aids in Uganda is the fact that President Museveni underwent a public HIV/Aids test. He instilled confidence in his people to know the need for them to undergo the test. I feel when somebody knows their HIV status it certainly puts them on a better footing to be able to fight against the virus. But if the public figures themselves come out and undergo the test it's kind of like instils confidence in the people who will not come forward and undergo the test themselves.

<p>But if leaders keep telling people that knowing your HIV status is good for our fight against the virus without they themselves undergoing the test it makes the whole thing absurd. And I certainly for one - I'm a journalist myself, involved with public programmes in Sierra Leone, and I happen to know that senior medical doctors have never undergone the HIV/Aids test themselves.

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>Umaru let's bring the President back in.

<p>President Festus Mogae:

<p>Okay maybe the doctors have not but I have undergone the test and announced the result and so presumably everybody's going to test now that I have tested and announced.

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>We will see, thanks very much indeed Umaru for that call. Let's go now to Joe Ntenwi in Salt Lake City in the United States. Joe what's your question to President Mogae?

<p>Joe Ntenwi:

<p>Mr President I'm so honoured to speak with you. I salute your mission and your leadership in the nation and history of Botswana. To know as well as I do sir that when you, as President, George W. Bush delivered his State of the Nation address to the nation and Congress here on Tuesday January 29th 2003 he amongst things said: "I ask Congress to commit $15 billion over the next five years. Ten billion dollars in new money to turn the tide against Aids in most nations in Africa and the Caribbean."

<p>I guess my question to you is that is very a year on what on, what part of this money has your government received from the Bush administration to help prevent new Aids infections and provide human care for people suffering from the disease? Is this presumptuous of me sir to think that the Bush administration's pledge is nothing but superpower cynicism and wickedly unfunny rhetoric?

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>Ok Joe, let's put that to President Mogae. What money have you seen?

<p>President Festus Mogae:

<p>Well two things. I think we must be familiar with the United States system. What has happened is that the President with the consent of the Congress has announced his intention to allocate $10 billion in additional money over the next five years. What has now to happen is that he's going to have to seek to appropriate that money and then Congress is going to debate and want to know how it's going to be used, how much will go to what country and so on. And it's still going to be a big fight. That is what happens as we know in the United States.

<p>But in any case with any government there is the first the announcement or the intention of the administration to do something, and then there has to be parliamentary appropriation. But regarding Botswana, well he says that the $10 billion will be new money. I am told that the $5 billion is part of the billions that has gone to the Global Fund already. And in return we are already in receipt of some money in the sense that, not out of that money, the new money, but out of old money. We have been helped to establish 16 voluntary testing and counselling centres they provided us. We built them or we bought houses with that money and they provided the kits and they trained our people, they provided the kits - the testing kits - and the alternative methods and so on and they provided two doctors who are supervising that whole programme.

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>But in terms of the American money which we were speaking about?

<p>President Festus Mogae:

<p>That's the American money I'm talking about.

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>But the money that was pledged by President Bush hasn't arrived, do you expect it to arrive any time soon?

<p>President Festus Mogae:

<p>No I know the procedure in the United States is going to take a long time for it to be appropriated. Assuming Congress then approves it.

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>So you're not completely sure that it will actually arrive in the end at all?

<p>President Festus Mogae:

<p>Yes it might not because there are other priorities for the American nation. But I think the President intended to do it and he will.

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>You think it should be a priority?

<p>President Festus Mogae:

<p>Well how can I determine other nations priorities? But I am just grateful for the assistance, the assistance to us has been generous.

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>Mr President let's take one more call now. Tazz Kajila is on the line from South Africa, Tazz what's your question to President Mogae?

<p>Tazz Kajila:

<p>Good afternoon. Well mine is not really a question. I really want to say I appreciate President Mogae for what his government is doing to fight Aids and also all the governments in Southern Africa. What I wanted to say is that governments can only do that much. People's attitudes towards Aids needs to change because what I see here in South Africa and Zambia, which is my home country, that people are not scared of Aids. They see adverts and they read papers and everything but their behaviour towards sex and it's just not right and it's like they're not afraid of Aids or anything. So I'm saying all the government fighting Aids and everything, they're doing their best and people also need to really show that they're also doing their part. But what we've seen here in Africa is a different story, thank you.

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>Let me get a response to that from President Mogae, how do you respond to that? Obviously a different situation in South Africa but similar in many ways.

<p>President Festus Mogae:

<p>Well I think the government can use its best endeavours to help, to inform and to the extent that it is able to provide assistance, certainly with orphans and certainly with antiretroviral therapy to the extent that the budgetary situation permits. But also preach change, even if people don't change at least they can't say they don't know.

<p>Roger Hearing:

<p>President Mogae thank you very much indeed for that. That's all we have time for today from Botswana. So my thanks to our guest President Festus Mogae, President of Botswana and of course to all of you who've taken part in this programme. If you want to contribute to the debate and to the ongoing debate at the moment about Aids you can go to our website: bbcnews.com/aids. But that's all from us at Talking Point, from all of us here on the team goodbye.

<p>
