<h>Lookin' Great and Feelin' Fine...

<p>Dude, Lita. Yer Mom's totally fuggly.

<p>... we're the class of '89! Sorry, but I am genetically hard-wired to embrace and write about all musical nostalgia, even when it dates and debases me. This unique trick comes to us via Roxanne and Jim Henley ; finding the top 100 singles from the year of your high school graduation.

<p>So, with all 100-long lists, I started off by thinking of some basic classifications: "That's a Kick-ass Song," "Pretty Good," "Semi-Listenable," "Makes Me Want to Kill Myself," and "Makes Me Want to Kill Myself After a Long Killing Spree." Then a took a closer look at the list from 1989 (graduation photo here for confirmation, one of many embarrassing pictures on my Flickr site) and decided that about 90% of the songs would fall in the bottom category. Who knew that NKOTB, Roxette, and Milli Vanilli could all blow up in the same year? So, in order to keep it positive, I'm just going to list the songs I could listen to a 30-second snippet of without going homicidal/suicidal:

<p>36. Buffalo Stance, Neneh Cherry

<p>42. Bust A Move, Young M.C.

<p>47. Love Shack, B-52's. On second thought, no. Not any more.

<p>51. So Alive, Love and Rockets. Just barely.

<p>58. Sowing The Seeds Of Love, Tears For Fears

<p>66. In Your Room, Bangles

<p>68. Love Song, Cure

<p>71. Patience, Guns N' Roses

<p>74. Welcome To The Jungle, Guns N' Roses

<p>76. Stand, R.E.M.

<p>77. Close My Eyes Forever, Lita Ford

<p>83. This Promise, When In Rome

<p>86. Paradise City, Guns N' Roses

<p>91. Poison, Alice Cooper

<p>100. Keep On Movin', Soul II Soul

<p>Only The Cure and Guns n' Roses remain on my digital jukebox, and their offerings are far from my favorites. That's not to say that I graduated into a wasteland; the following albums were released that year (in addition to all those alterna-albums that I can't possibly think of):

<p>Bad Religion "No Control" // Beastie Boys "Paul's Boutique" // Camper Van Beethoven "Key Lime Pie" // Elvis Costello "Spike"  // Faith No More "The Real Thing" // Lenny Kravitz "Let Love Rule" // Neil Young "Freedom"  // New Order "Technique" // Nine Inch Nails // Nine Inch Nails "Pretty Hate Machine" // Nirvana "Bleach" // Public Image Limited "9" // Red Hot Chili Peppers "Mother's Milk" // Stevie Ray Vaughn "In Step" // The Flaming Lips "Telepathic Surgery" // The Pogues "Peace And Love"

<p>Then I got to further "thinking"... MTV and Top 40 radio have always been geared towards middle-schoolers. I don't think that music got appreciably worse from during my high school years, but I'll bet that I retain more of an appreciation for 1985's unadulterated crap (same list in the extended entry)...
