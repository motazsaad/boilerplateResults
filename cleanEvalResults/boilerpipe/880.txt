<p>Lucky Random Eleven Friday Musical Self-Audit.

<p>If you've never heard "Trans-Europe Express" as a rhumba with xylophones, you don't know what you're missing (#3).

<p>It's Friday, and time to gauge your intrinsic worth as a human being on this planet via the PAINFUL. MUSICAL. SELF-AUDIT (check previous editions in the Musique Non-Stop category for examples). Fire up the jukebox, don't skip over anything, and rate the first eleven tunes that pop up...

<p>1. "You've Never Seen Me Cry" The Flatlanders. The reunited band of legend from Lubbock, Texas plays a laid-back country ballad with lead vocals by one of the most unique singers in existence, Jimmie Dale Gilmore. 7/10.

<p>2.  "Ghost Riders in the Sky" Dick Dale. One of the four or so versions of this song I have on the jukebox. About as kick-ass as his cover of "Hava Negila," so I suppose you could use both at a cowboy bar mitzvah. 8/10.

<p>3.  "Chocolatina" Senor Coconut y su Conjunto. A rare non-Kraftwerk cover by this Latin-tinged enigma (actually a German DJ ). Apparently he's taking on some Thriller-era Michael Jackson covers now. 7/10.

<p>4.  "Peace in the Valley" Sam Cooke (and the Soul Stirrers). Basically a lo-fi, a capella rendering of the gospel standard. Nothing special, even with one of the best voices of all time. 6/10.

<p>5. "Johnny Feelgood" Liz Phair. Just the right amount of synth sounds, rollicking guitar, and really disturbing lyrics. 8/10.

<p>6. "Mountain Man" Dinosaur Jr. An early, sloppy, grungy slab of something, with duelling crappy vocals by J. Mascis and Lou Barlow, in all likelihood. I'm not going to research it. 4/10.

<p>7. "Startin' Up A Posse" Anthrax. Oh Lord. Can a song with the background vocal "cunty cunty cunty cunt," even in regard to the declining PMRC, really rate that high, even with the "and this song ain't sexist, either!" disclaimer? It was a "Killer B-side" for a reason. 3/10.

<p>8. "Clover Over Dover" Blur. One of my favorite pieces of decade-mixing Britpop (anything with a lead harpsichord line scores points in my book) from a band I wish was playing instead of Oasis or Coldplay at the Austin City Limits music festival, not that it matters because all the tickets for that day sold out anyway. Fuck the Austin City Limits festival and their $55 day passes anyway. 9/10.

<p>9. "I Can't Stand Up For Falling Down" Sam & Dave. Performed as a real gut-wrenching ballad here (written by Isaac Hayes); I would have preferred the quicker pace of the Elvis Costello cover (but with the impeccable vocals of Mr. Moore and Mr. Prater). 5/10.

<p>10. "I Hate Alternative Rock" Bob Mould. And I hate this song. Did you borrow Eddie Van Halen's power screwdriver or something? Sorry, Bob. 3/10.

<p>11. "Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Spacecraft" Babes in Toyland. A strange voyage for this song, from Klaatu to the Carpenters to riot-grrrl pioneers "If I Were a Carpenter" cover album. In your mind you have capacities, you know? Works for about two minutes. 5/10.

<p>5.9/10. I need to upgrade. Suggestions welcome! You previously shouted your favorites at me with comments to this post , so there's no need to repeat.
