<p>38 weeks, 1 day Baby Griffin Alexander Teevan Hehmeyer arrived!  Mom and baby are healthy and happy.  More news to come.

<p>Wednesday, June 23, 2004

<p>37 weeks, 4 days The crib finally arrived, completing baby's nursery.   Check the photo album shortly for pictures.  Friends and family  have begun calling the expectant parents regularly to make sure they don't  miss the big event.  To set them at ease, Jaime and Alex have created a  mailing list where news of impending labor and delivery will be sent ( subscribe ).

<p>36 weeks, 6 days Even though there are still three weeks left until Baby's EDD, if he were born tomorrow, he'd be considered full term!  Yesterday the midwife found baby positioned properly (vertex) and beginning to drop.  Jaime and Alex took a tour of Mt. Auburn Hospital last week, and were very impressed at how nice the Labor & Delivery rooms are.  Although surely when Jaime's in labor, they won't care about the nice hardwood floors or beautiful views.

<p>Thursday, June 10, 2004

<p>35 weeks, 5 days Exactly one month until Baby's estimated due date! However, Internet research indicated that first time babies are typically born 8 days after their EDD, so perhaps July 18th is a better target.  In  any case, it's hard to be patient now with the end so near, but Mom and Dad  are trying.

<p>Thursday, June 3, 2004

<p>34 weeks, 5 days Baby's first visit to the midwife in Cambridge since January went well, and Alex got to come along, too.  A quick ultrasound showed baby was well, with his head down and slightly to the right of Mom's pelvis.

<p>At home, Alex is starting to get settled in, and there aren't that many boxes left to be unpacked.  The car seat's been installed, and Baby's room is starting to get furnished, although Mom and Dad are still waiting on the arrival of the crib.

<p>Thursday, May 20, 2004

<p>32 weeks, 5 days The whole family is together again, as Jaime and Baby have returned to Boston and Alex graduates from business school this weekend.  No more travel for Baby now until he's born.

<p>Monday, May 10, 2004

<p>31 weeks, 2 days Baby got to spend Mother's Day with both his own mother and his grandmothers, as Jaime visited San Francisco this weekend.  Saturday Baby had a baby shower, and it looks like he's going to be one well dressed little boy!  Bad omens from the tea-leaf reader at the shower, who warned the delivery will be difficult, but fortunately Mom and Dad know it will be otherwise.

<p>Sunday, May 2, 2004

<p>30 weeks, 1 day Jaime and Baby are back from attending a conference in Vienna.  The long trip wasn't nearly as difficult as anticipated, and Vienna was a beautiful city.  Too bad Baby doesn't get frequent flier miles -- by the end of this pregnancy he'll have flown over 50,000 miles!

<p>Thursday, April 22, 2004

<p>28 weeks, 5 days Another uneventful doctor's appointment today.  Baby's heartbeat: 154 beats/minute. The doctor confirmed Jaime's hypothesis that the baby is lying at a diagonal, with his head down at her lower left side, and his bottom up on her right side just under her ribs.  There's still plenty of time for him to orient himself properly, with his head in Mom's pelvis.

<p>Meanwhile, Mom and Dad are preparing for baby's arrival by starting to plan the nursery, which will have a "Where the Wild Things Are" theme.   The crib and changing table are on there way, and Dad will set them up when they arrive.  Other than that, most things will remain in the planning stage until Jaime returns home to Boston (in just three weeks!).

<p>Thursday, April 8, 2004

<p>26 weeks, 5 days At the doctor's today Jaime got permission for her upcoming trip to Vienna, since all continues to go well.  She passed her gestational diabetes test (1 hour glucose: 99), and had good iron levels (Hgb: 12.8).  Baby was very wiggly at the appointment, probably because of all of the sugar Mom had to drink for the GD test.  Baby's heartbeat: 150 beats/minute.  The end of this week marks the beginning of the third trimester.  From now on Mom and Baby will be visiting the doctor every two weeks instead of every four.

<p>Friday, April 2, 2004

<p>25 weeks, 6 days Dad is traveling to Seattle to visit tonight.  Mom and Baby can't wait.  It's unfortunately his last trip out to Seattle.  The family will next be together when Jaime returns to Boston on May 17th.

<p>Wednesday, March 18, 2004

<p>23 weeks, 4 days Jaime's doctor appointment on March 11th came and went uneventfully.  Baby's heartbeat: 155 beats/minute.  Mom and Baby have begun playing games ("If you're happy and you know it, kick your mommy.."), and Dad continues learning lullabies in his singing lessons to sing to belly when he's in town.

<p>Wednesday, March 3, 2004

<p>21 weeks, 4 days Jaime has really started to gain weight ( graph ).  Alex is arriving tomorrow to visit Mom and Baby.

<p>Saturday, February 21, 2004

<p>20 weeks Today marks the official half-way point of the pregnancy, and Baby is  squirming lots in celebration.  Mom and Dad can't wait to meet him!

<p>Friday, February 13, 2004

<p>18 weeks, 6 days Despite it being Friday the Thirteenth, the ultrasound went very well. Everything appeared exactly as it should, and Mom and Dad learned they are having a baby boy!  Hearbeat: 142 beats/minute.  Weight: 12 ounces. Based on the ultrasound, the due date was put at July 1, but Jaime and Alex are pretty sure of the dates and continue to think of it as July 10. Jaime is starting to appear pregnant, versus just thick in the middle, and she might even break out some maternity clothes this weekend.

<p>Tuesday, February 10, 2004

<p>18 weeks, 3 days Jaime had her first Seattle doctor's appointment today, and everything is fine with mom and baby.  Baby's heartbeat: 160 beats/minute.  An ultrasound is scheduled for Friday, while Alex is in town.

<p>Tuesday, February 3, 2004

<p>17 weeks, 3 days Last Friday brought the results of the Quad Screen Jaime took earlier in the week.  Using only the mother's blood, the Quad Screen can detect if the fetus has a heightened risk of Down Syndrome or neural tube defects.  Fortunately, everything came back normal.  As soon as Jaime finds a doctor in Seattle, she'll schedule an anatomical ultrasound, hopefully for while Alex is in town.  Then they get to learn the gender!

<p>Wednesday, January 28, 2004

<p>16 weeks, 4 days Jaime leaves at the end of this week for three and a half months in Seattle (to intern at Microsoft Research).  She's doing well, although she's somewhat sleepy and has headaches off and on.  Although she's beginning to get a bit of a belly (see Photo Album), both parents are looking forward to more.

<p>Monday, January 12, 2004

<p>14 weeks, 2 days Jaime, Alex and Baby returned yesterday from a  three week vacation in Hawaii.  Because Alex was in town, he was able to attend Jaime's morning doctor's appointment with her, and together they heard the baby's heart galloping along on the doppler.

<p>Monday, December 9, 2003

<p>9 weeks, 2 days Jaime had her first prenatal appointment today. Everything seems to be going along swimmingly.

<p>Tuesday, November 20, 2003

<p>6 weeks, 5 days An ultrasound this morning showed a 0.73cm fetus with its heart beating away at 133 beats/minute.  Pictures will be posted shortly.  In general, Jaime is feeling well, although she is very tired and looking forward to the end of the first trimester.

<p>Tuesday, November 18, 2003

<p>6 weeks, 3 days hCG level: 33,549.

<p>Wednesday, November 12, 2003

<p>5 weeks, 4 days Very light spotting in the morning leads to an ultrasound that finds, as expected, a gestational sac and a yolk sac, located in the uterus.  This means that the pregnancy is not ectopic and that Jaime is not carrying twins.  A follow-up ultrasound will be conducted next Thursday to confirm the existence of a fetal heartbeat before Jaime and Alex leave for Istanbul.  hCG level: 12,033.

<p>Monday, November 10, 2003

<p>5 weeks, 2 days Because of some spotting several weeks ago (1 week post-ovulation) and an impending trip to Turkey, MIT Medical decides to do yet another blood test.  Jaime's hCG levels continue rise well and her blood type is O+. hCG level: 7,098.

<p>Wednesday, November 5, 2003

<p>4 weeks, 5 days A second blood test confirms that hCG levels are rising properly.  hCG level: 973.

<p>Monday, November 3, 2003

<p>4 weeks, 3 days Pregnancy is confirmed by a blood test at MIT Medical.  hCG level: 402.

<p>Sunday, November 2, 2003

<p>4 weeks, 2 days Jaime's period is a day late.  Jaime and Alex purchase a home pregnancy test and are thrilled and surprised (despite this being planned) by a very strong positive!  They go out to a nice brunch at the Rusty Scupper in New Haven and celebrate with (virgin) bloody marys.
