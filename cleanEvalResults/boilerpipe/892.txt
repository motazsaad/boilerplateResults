<p>Im in Mangere. I guess my biggest problem is Portraits in our lounge at night. just cant seem to get the lighting right. I have a Sunpack 455 Tri flash with a white unmbrella, an assortment of other lights. Im getting better, but Im still missing some key in my understanding about light shutter speed a F stops.I know what they all do but Im waiting for that "eurika" "click" to go off in my head.

<p>I dont have a light meter  / flash meter so to an extent im shooting in the dark (excuse pun. Night is the only time when my wife is able to be my model (mind you she did say last night I need to get a model, umm I dont think she would be happy with a 18yr old babe in the house).

<p>I cant post pictures of our shoots as the arrangement was she would pose but I was not allowed to let anyone else see them. So that makes it a little harder for people to help. I have to respect her wishes or get a 18yr old babe

<p>ummmmmmmmm

<p>Hmmm, most of the portrait work I do is natural light only, as artifical light is a bit of an art form in itself.  For now it might be best to try and use some bright normal lights, and compensate in the white balance.

<p>It will be very difficult to control all that flash light without a flash meter though.  You should be able to get something OK with one flash and a brolly.

<p>Can you post an example?

<p>Might be able to swing by at some point, nights are best for my busy scehdule!

<p>From your lens collection, I would pick the EF50, and stop it down a bit
