<p>GUILD EXPLAINS CONTRACT TO MEMBERS IN MARATHON MEETING

<p>The fireworks that some expected never materialized last night at a Guild meeting that lasted from 7 p.m. until 10:20 p.m. The meeting was somber as a funeral, as some hard-won benefits won over decades were given the last rites as a dozen members of the Guild negotiating team, and leadership, expressed bitterness about a contract they are forced to recommend to members.

<p>More than 200 members attended. The Guild has some 900 members.

<p>Guild leaders patiently answered questions about editorial and advertising rules, seniority, the pension, sick leave and other issues. Members were more mournful than mad, and they applauded the efforts of negotiators who have put in endless hours over the course of many days to come up with a contract that they themselves termed a "bitter pill." A few shed tears last night by the end of the meeting.

<p>Several Guild members strongly questioned aspects of the contract and asked about the ramifications of rejecting it at a ratification meeting scheduled for 7 p.m. Monday at Temple Rodeph Shalom, 615 N. Broad St.

<p>"This is not 1985," said Inquirer-Daily News Unit Chair Diane Mastrull, in reference to a 46-day strike, the longest in the papers' history. There is no guarantee of jobs "when we put down those picket signs."

<p>The contract's only improvements, which Mastrull termed "minor," came for the Suburban Writers and Photographers unit. Members in that unit are paid less for the same work as members in the main unit.

<p>Addressing the members, Mastrull said, "you can be angry" and cited a "sense of betrayal" the Guild feels about the publisher, but the Guild's bottom line was "to save jobs."

<p>"Be angry, be disgusted, but direct it at people who overpaid for these papers so we have to bail them out."

<p>Local President Henry Holcomb said the recommended, disagreeable contract, provides a foundation on which the Guild can build when business improves in the newspaper industry.

<p>Dow Jones union reacts to WSJ deal with breakingviews

<p>From: Steven Yount

<p>Date: December 12, 2006 4:57:55 PM EST

<p>Subject: Newsroom Outsourcing?

<p>Friends,

<p>The Wall Street Journal has said it will begin running the "breakingviews" Wall Street column daily. It's a column of stock-market commentary produced by an outside group, including former Financial Times reporters -- and a move that smacks of the Journal outsourcing its core news coverage.

<p>Not only is management closing the Journal's Canadian bureaus and firing Journal correspondents in Canada, they no longer are willing to pay our own staff reporters to provide the high-quality coverage that is central to the mission of The Wall Street Journal.

<p>Worse, this is the most sensitive kind of reporting that The Wall Street Journal produces.

<p>Stories that have the potential to move markets can lead to serious problems -- and have, at other publications as well as at the Journal, where a reporter in the 1980s was caught selling advance tips about his stories to Wall Street traders. That reporter went to jail and the Journal suffered the worst scandal in its history. In response to that scandal, the Journal set up extensive internal controls to prevent such a thing ever from happening again here.

<p>When it produces news in-house, the Journal and Dow Jones can ensure that strong controls are in place to prevent this kind of abuse. Once it relinquishes that control to an outsider -- whoever that outsider is -- the famous and time-tested Dow Jones guarantee of quality becomes that much weaker. That's particularly true if the outsider has a wide range of clients with competing interests.

<p>Is this the formula for the WSJ of the future -- homogenized news, prepared by outsiders who don't ask for healthcare or retirement, and who can't talk back?

<p>For the cynics who always thought the Journal’s new masters were prepared to sacrifice quality in the name of cost cutting, this might be prove to be the smoking gun.

<p>We certainly hope not.

<p>Tenative agreement at Philadelphia papers

<p>12/13/2006 7:35:21 AM

<p>TENTATIVE AGREEMENT BETWEEN GUILD AND COMPANY

<p>Dec. 13, 2006

<p>The Guild and the PN reached a tentative agreement on all issues at 10:15 p.m. Tuesday.

<p>"It's a package requiring a lot of sacrifice from our members. But it is a package that is far less devastating than what the Company originally proposed," said Unit Chairwoman Diane Mastrull, who led the negotiating team into holding onto many of our benefits.

<p>There's no sugar coating this contract. It is a disappointing, giveback deal.

<p>We will discuss elements of the contract more fully Wednesday at 7 p.m. at Congregation Rodeph Shalom Synagogue. This is not a ratification meeting, but one will be held as soon as we can book an appropriate sized venue.

<p>Below is a brief description of the hot-button issues.

<p>DURATION: 3 years. The contract expires at Midnight August 31, 2009.

<p>WAGES: Employees shall receive no pay increase in the first year.    Full-time employees shall receive a $1,500 bonus (paid in two parts) in the second year. Employees shall receive a $25 per week raise in the third year. Due to rising increases in health and welfare costs, it is possible that some if not all of this money will be diverted into the Guild's health and welfare fund which is responsible for your sick benefits.

<p>PENSION: The Guild and PN will work through the Pension Board, which is comprised of three Guild trustees and three PN trustees, to merge with a multi-employer pension plan by Dec. 31, 2007.  A multi-employer plan is a pension plan in which more than one employer participates. Many single-employer pension plans nowadays are also merging into multi-employer pension plans which provide economic incentives to companies and which are considered safer investments than single-employer funds./ CONTINUED BELOW

<p>Tenative agreement at Philadelphia papers

<p>12/13/2006 7:34:12 AM

<p>Because our plan is healthy, it is an attractive merger partner and we are hoping to negotiate a seat on the board of the new fund. Employees will receive an additional year of benefit service credit on their pensions for the year 2007. Once merged into a multi-employer plan, our pension may be frozen, but there is also an option to keep the plan alive, with employee contributions coming through payroll diversions.

<p>The Company will give $4 million to the Guild earmarked as a contribution to the new multi-employer plan or to fund an employee's existing 401(k) or establish a 401(k) for employees who do not yet have such an account. There are however, no plans for PN to contribute any additional money, or ongoing "match" to employees' 401(k) accounts.

<p>There is tremendous financial incentive for the employer if the Pension Trustees can successfully establish a multi-employer plan merger. However, if such a merger does not take place, the company may eventually assume sole administration of the pension fund.

<p>Because so many members have said they have little to no trust for our new owners, we have negotiated extraordinary transparency so we may monitor the plan and additionally, have full legal recourse in the event of any appearance of impropriety by PN with the pension fund.

<p>Despite members' concerns, PN will not be able to invest our pension fund recklessly. Under the strict federal laws of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), the employer shall be obligated to invest our pension fund with the utmost caution.

<p>SICK TIME: A Guild member can take up to 40 weeks sick time, depending on how long he /she has worked here (Article 21 of the current contract) but they will be paid at 65 percent of their salary rather than at 100 percent as it is today. In the event of injury or hospitalization, benefits (at 65 percent pay) shall begin on the first day of absence.  For the first absence due to illness in any calendar year, employees will be paid at 100 percent for up to three days of absence. After the first three days, they shall be paid at 65 percent. If an employee is not absent due to illness between either January 1, 2007 to June 30, 2007 or July 1, 2007 to December 31, 2007 he/she may earn an additional "pass" of up to three days of pay at 100 percent. Employees can carry a "pass" into the next calendar year, but can at no time hold more than two. If the employee does not have a pass and calls out sick, he/she will not be paid until the fourth day of illness at which point they will be paid at 65 percent rate.

<p>SENIORITY: There are changes in the reduction in force (layoff) language for the newsrooms and for advertising sales people but not for other job categories. In the newsrooms, all classes of editors, artists and photographers will continue to live under straight seniority. However, there are carve outs for some beat reporters, columnists and critics, as designated by what Inquirer editor Bill Marimow and Daily News editor Michael Days have identified as the core functions of their newspapers. The editor may skip over those classes of reporters as he works up the layoff list. He must, however, allow anyone in danger of being laid off and who has held any of those beats for a year to bump less senior employees.

<p>As for the ad department, commissioned sales people will now be merged into the seniority list with salaried sales people based on their dates of hire.

<p>"Bob [Woodward] is a great boss, but..."

<p>12/11/2006 6:22:33 PM

<p>Here's your chance to work for Bob Woodward

<p>Bob Woodward's looking for a new full-time assistant to act as his "right hand man or woman." His ad on a journalism jobs site -- written by current assistant Bill Murphy Jr. -- says: "You will research, report, write and edit. You will also handle administrative matters -- transcribing interview tapes, helping him keep track of his calendar and requests, and running his small office" out of his Washington, DC home.

<p>"Primarily, you will work on whatever major project Bob undertakes next, be it another book, articles for The Washington Post, etc. Most of the time you will be working on several things at once, and sometimes these 'secondary assignments' can take on a life of their own."

<p>The ad continues:

<p>"This is not a job to expect to have for your entire career. The normal model is 'two years or one book,' whichever comes first. It is a great and perhaps unique opportunity to learn from an accomplished journalist and to contribute to in-depth reporting on the most timely topics.

<p>"These are meant as guidelines, and we offer them in part to encourage you to self-select a bit. To be blunt, we are probably NOT looking for someone 24-25 years old, two or three years out of college, looking to move on from his or her first job. Ideally, candidates should have five to eight years experience in journalism, books, or in-depth research and writing."

<p>Murphy says posting the ad "is a bit of an experiment. Our goal is to open up the process and democratize it. We want to cast a wide net, and spread the word about this opportunity."

<p>Woodward's assistant tells applicants:

<p>"First, think about whether you really and truly meet the description of who we are looking for. If you haven’t worked in journalism before or haven’t been a writer, or if you’re really just beginning your career, this probably is not the job for you---at least not yet.

<p>"Second, think about whether you really want to work for one person, being more or less at his beck and call for two years. Bob is a great boss, but this job is intense and demanding, and it's not for everyone."

<p>Tierney's letter to Philly Guild journalists

<p>Philadelphia Newspaper Guild message to members

<p>Below you will find a 12/7/06 open letter from Brian Tierney to employees of Philadelphia Newspapers, which we are sharing as a public service.

<p>Skipping over the self-serving blather, Brian Tierney writes (on Page 2) that “we are all in this together" - except when it comes to directing the investments of our pension fund.

<p>That's when it becomes "me," not “we."

<p>We have a problem with that for one simple reason: It's OUR money, put there for US by Knight-Ridder. It is not Brian's money to invest. The fund is both safe and healthy.

<p>The text follows:
