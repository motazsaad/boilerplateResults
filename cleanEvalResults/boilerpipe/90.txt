<p>Merry Christmas!

<p>The first year that Officer Jake was on the LAPD he was the new guy in town - literally. He'd moved here from out of state and only had a distant cousin who lived way up in Ventura. When Christmas rolled around, he was still a fresh boot - only a few months out of the Academy and working weekends, holidays, etc. And so he spent his first Christmas in L.A. on the job - out all day patrolling in a black and white. He had a few cookies at the station, I'm sure. But after work he went home to his bachelor apartment and had a tradition holiday meal of .... Pollo Loco.

<p>When he first told me this story I thought I was going to cry. I just wanted to hug him like he was a child and tell him he'd never be alone or eating bad chicken on Christmas again. But this is pretty common for a lot of law enforcement officers everywhere. Crime doesn't take holidays or weekends off. And neither do police officers.

<p>So here's to the rookies from out of town working on the holidays - I hope you are greeted by well-wishers, lots of treats and invited to someone's home for a proper family meal. I instructed Jake to ask around the station and see if there are any young men or women who are in a similar situation as the young Officer Jake found himself that Christmas so long ago. He has standing orders from this watch commander (me!) to invite them over.

<p>And I'm not forgetting the seasoned officers still working the holidays. Thanks for hanging in there and doing the good job that you do. You are appreciated!

<p>And here's to the wives and families, missing their officers but waiting faithfully for them to get back home after their shift and share in the festivities. In the past we've celebrated on alternate days or waited to open presents til Daddy got home. It's important to find a rhythm in your family to dealing with the missed holidays and weekend time off.

<p>And here's to my readers. You've made my Christmas wonderful by being so supportive of me here. Thanks!

<p>Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays everyone!

<p>LAPD Wife - The Newsletter

<p>Due to high demand, I've decided to create "LAPD Wife - The Newsletter" to hold you all over while I take a couple months to reorganize (see the post "Not a Goodbye, below). This will probably be a once-a-month deal, but hey, you know I'll make it worth your while. So email me with your email address and I'll add you to my "subscription" list. The price is right... free! And I promise to keep your email address confidential and never, ever use it for my own evil purposes.

<p>I'm going to turn off comments here, because I don't want you to mistakenly put your email on this post for all the world to see. Again, send me your email address via my email and I'll make sure you're on the list. How very "L.A!"

<p>(To clarify, this is an e-newsletter only. Don't send me your postal address. Email addresses only. thanks!)

<p>Not a Goodbye

<p>Over two years ago, in June of 2004, "LAPD Wife" was born. I've nurtured this site with news and articles of police family life and shared personal stories of the ups, downs and crazy turns in my life married to Officer Jake, an LAPD narcotics officer.

<p>I've made so many new friends and met many interesting, fascinating people online. I feel like my original goal of using this site to reach out to other wives and family members of law enforcement has been reached and in fact, has grown beyond my wildest expectations. I've had nearly 300,000 hits in this short life and maintained a daily average of nearly 600.

<p>And so it saddens me to do this, but I'm now at a point where I need to take a break, step away from the keyboard and rejuvenate. My life, always busy, has reached new pinnacles of craziness both professionally and personally. Don't worry, all is well with me, I'm just exploring new ideas and trying out new avenues for my creative self.

<p>I've tried to put up this post often during the last couple of weeks, but it seems like every day as my finger hovered over the Save button, I'd get another e-mail from an leo wife who had "just found my site" and "was so excited to find someone writing about our lives who really understands" ...and I just couldn't do it. It still kills me to step back like this, but I'm burning out and not doing you all much good in this stage.

<p>I'm keeping the rights to this url, www.lapdwife.com , and I'd encourage you to check back every month or so to see what I'm up to. I also will still have my e-mail address , so feel free to drop me a line once in awhile at renee@lapdwife.com . I have a lot of ideas circling in my very crowded head that I'm sure many of you will love and still will cater to the leo family life theme I've always followed. Just will take a little time, a lot of effort and great amounts of love to bring them to life.

<p>To all of you who have been my loyal readers, my ardent commentors, my site watchdogs and most of all, my friends - thank you. This site has been a labor of love for me and I feel well rewarded from the contacts I've made and the community I've felt among us all. And the biggest thanks of all goes to Office Jake, without which there would be no "LAPD Wife."

<p>Thanks - and look for me in the New Year - I'll see you soon.

<p>Happy 231st Birthday Marines!

<p>Every year GoDaddy, a service I use for maintaining this site and others I administer, puts up a a special salute to the men and women of the United States Marine Corps. This year Gunnery Sgt. R. Lee Ermey of Full Metal Jacket fame collaborates with them. I know that a lot of Marine wives and family members also read my site, so I'm putting up the link for them here. Even if you're not a part of the Marine Corps, this is a worthy watch.
