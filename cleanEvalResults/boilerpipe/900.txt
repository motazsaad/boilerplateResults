<p>Stupp: Potts misses my point

<p>12/22/2006 12:03:07 PM

<p>From JOE STRUPP , Editor & Publisher: I appreciate Mark Potts responding to my list as it is here for discussion and critique. But I think HE misses my point. His overall view that the newspaper industry had finally figured out that it is in trouble is not news, they have realized it for years. Anyone who has followed the biz as we have knows, and E&P has been documenting in all aspects better than anyone, that the problems have been around for a while. It seems that he is the one who finally figured it out.

<p>I agree that the industry has not done enough on the use of the Web and some other areas. But my goal was to look at the events of the year that have happened and mix them with what the future may require. My statement that the ‘Web Comes Of Age” was not a comment on the overall Web, but the newspaper industry’s use of it. That seemed pretty clear as the entire list was on the newspaper industry. Too bad Potts did not notice that.

<p>The news of the year is not that the newspaper industry finally figured out that it had a problem, but that the industry has not seemed to nail down the solutions. My list notes in many areas where they have sought to make moves in a substantial way. It references web expansion, job cuts, ownership changes, and other specific stories, along with various non-business happenings that are just as important. That is the point of such a list, to analyze specific events during the year, not give some generality that offers little insight. [Permalink]

<p>LAT publishers sacrificed more than Baquet

<p>12/20/2006 6:08:10 PM

<p>From GARY DRETZKA : I've been an editor, reporter and desk drone for several newspapers, including the Chicago Tribune. It strikes me as myopic that the New York Observer would give its Mensch Award to Dean Baquet without also acknowledging that the greater sacrifice probably came from the publishers -- both Tribune lifers -- who saw the light and "went native."

<p>Dean's leadership qualities and many journalistic acomplishments assured him of a plethora of high-profile career options, no matter what he said or did in the wake of the departures of John Carroll and publishers John Puerner and Jeff Johnson. He tried mightily to play the Tribune's game, but, to almost no one's great surprise, it wasn't to be. His wasn't a suicide mission, and he'll live to fight again.

<p>For a publisher to take a stand against his own employer is much riskier, in that corporate entities expect and demand loyalty as part of the job description of any senior manager. They know it going in, and are handsomely compensated for putting their ethical convictions on hiatus. It explains why publishers tend to be Republican, no matter the political leanings of their editorial boards.

<p>I have no idea what John and Jeff are doing for work. I doubt they will be forced any time soon to join the legion of homeless folks who live in the shadow of the Times building. I'm more certain, though, they won't be receiving Man of the Year honors from E&P magazine or American Newspaper Publishers Association.

<p>Give Dean his due, but don't forget the larger sacrifice. Something tells me that media organizations aren't standing in line to hire progressive publishers. [Permalink]

<p>Barry said it best

<p>12/20/2006 5:34:06 PM

<p>From DENNIS McCAFFERTY , senior writer, USA Weekend: Re. the NY Times and writing-for-awards mania at this time of the year. There was no greater (and funnier) sendup of this journalism inevitability than this , from Dave Barry, 20 years ago. Ironically, this, among a few other submissions, won Barry the Pulitzer Prize that year. [Permalink]

<p>Retiring Union-Trib writer's spiked column

<p>12/19/2006 11:07:44 AM

<p>From PRESTON TUREGANO : I was among 43 employees of the San Diego Union-Tribune who retired this month as a result of an early retirement buyout to reduce the workforce and save salaries. I believe 19 of those 43 were newsroom staffers. I worked there 36 years. From my proposed final column, which was spiked because my standing Sunday Arts News Scene column wasn't the type that carried a mug shot, you will understand the saga of my stormy UT career. Many individuals here have asked me for a copy of the spiked swan song and I have sent it to them. You have my permission to post it.

<p>ARTS NEWS SCENE COMMENTARY

<p>ARTS WRITER

<p>Forty-odd years ago, certain things said about me by a classmate and a

<p>teacher at Robert E. Lee High School in San Antonio, Texas helped set the stage for my career in journalism.

<p>We'll start with the yearbook and school paper advisor/teacher, whom I

<p>often interrupted as she rambled on about famous newspaper reporters she knew. She predicted I would never make a good reporter because I was "so rude."

<p>Sorry, Mrs. Abbott, but chutzpah came in handy during my career as a U.S. Navy journalist and later a reporter for the Evening Tribune (which became the San Diego Tribune) that merged with The San Diego Union in 1992.

<p>As of Dec. 15, I am a retired San Diego Union-Tribune arts writer; one of several company employees who this month accepted an early retirement incentive package.

<p>My UT career began in 1970 as a copyboy (these days known as an "editorial assistant") and segued to general assignment reporter, which meant being equally ignorant about all subjects and willing to take on any assignment -- such as murders, fires, car wrecks, press conferences, and people who collect match book covers -- on a moment's notice./ CONTINUED BELOW

<p>Retiring Union-Trib writer's spiked column

<p>12/19/2006 11:05:27 AM

<p>Some GA stories dealt with the arts. Tribune editors knew I had a passion for classical music, theater and art. In 1984, one editor mumbled to me during a crack-of-dawn phone call that he wanted to go to the Old Globe Theatre in the wake of a fire that destroyed the Globe's outdoor stage. "You know those Globe types, so they'll talk to you," he said.

<p>Types?

<p>Over the years, I wrote arts stories, or did classical music reviews for the Tribune when the music critic was out of town or unavailable. When the Tribune and Union merged, I became the paper's first full-time arts news writer, chronicling arts organizations' hirings, firings, deficits, surpluses, government support, as well as projects, programming and trends. There are few feathers-ruffling exposes. Luck for me polonium 210 wasn't vogue at the time.

<p>It may have been rude to ask arts administrators how much they earned, or their age, but someone had to pry and probe. (I often got the impression they would rather discuss their sex lives rather than disclose salary or age.) I reminded a few of the offended that a newspaper is the eyes and ears of the public, especially when it comes to nonprofit organizations that receive taxpayer dollars. I came to love IRS Form 990s, public documents that show how nonprofits raise and spend money.

<p>Fast forward to another editor circa 1995, gruffly intoning to me, "People

<p>in the arts community are afraid of you. I don't like that."

<p>I did.

<p>In late 1997, I took a break from arts news to cover local TV and radio

<p>(and a goodly share of general TV programming) for approximately eight years. I now refer to that time as the dark years. It became darker as vapid, contrived reality shows swept the landscape. The only reality TV shows I've ever liked are Bowflex commercials. In any case, I occasionally made the lives of local TV and radio figures miserable.

<p>After Welton Jones retired in 2001 as Union-Tribune critic-at-large and

<p>arts news writer (which he took over when I went to TV and radio), I juggled broadcasting and arts writing. The arts and I reunited full-time two years ago.

<p>As for that high school classmate's observation, anyone who knows me

<p>personally or professionally is certain to agree with Marcia Guthridge.

<p>"Preston, when you die, the world won't be able to stand the silence," she wrote in our graduation yearbook, sarcastically acknowleding my penchant for dishing and boisterously giving my opinion, especially when it wasn't solicited.

<p>I'm not dying, but mourning is unavoidable right now. Letting go of familiar surroundings and long time work-related relationships equals loss. I adhere to the notion that some co-workers are like relatives; you love them, warts and all (and vice versa, of course).

<p>As for silence, not now, thank you, except maybe on the third floor

<p>newsroom of the Mission Valley Union-Tribune building. For me, the arts -- particularly San Diego's thriving community -- will always be something to shout about. As many have said, "the arts are the signature of civilization."

<p>In these scary uncertain times, there's much to be said for the civility,

<p>thought provocation and delight the arts bring to all of us, and for a big

<p>part of my Union-Tribune career brought me a sense of pride and purpose. [Permalink]

<p>Anti-war pundits who haven't been booked

<p>12/18/2006 3:35:06 PM

<p>From CLIFF HUTCHINS : In reponse to an inquiry regarding why those who were wrong about the Iraq war are still frequenting the airwaves, Howard Kurtz states that "the newscasts and talk shows would have a near-impossible time finding guests" to appear on their programs. If that were the case, it would most certainly be due to the fact that they were not looking very hard. Even a so-called liberal such as Keith Olbermann rarely has a genuine anti-war voice on his show. He and others could start by allowing such articulate spokespeople as Anthony Arnove, Howard Zinn, Amy Goodman, Kevin Zeese, Norman Solomon, Tariq Ali, Arundhati Roy, Camilo Mejia, Dahr Jamail, Nir Rosen, Peter Laufer, et al,  to appear on their programs. In the lead up to the war, there was, astonishingly, only one anti-war person heard on the airwaves. it appears in late 2006, that  the more things change, the more they remain the same. [Permalink]

<p>Great irony

<p>12/15/2006 4:17:10 PM

<p>From GARY JASINEK , managing editor, Wenatchee, WA World: Doesn't anyone else see the irony of SPJ's taking money to form an alliance with a flack outfit (it's NOT a "newswire"), so as to educate people about journalism ethics? [Permalink}

<p>McClanahan has conflated historical events

<p>12/15/2006 10:00:25 AM

<p>From DENNIS PERSICA : Subject -- Saigon falling. Let's put things in factual perspective regarding the day Saigon fell. I don't know if the UPI staffers in Dallas cheered the day Saigon fell as Thomas McClanahan says they did. What's clear though is that, thirtysomething years later, he has conflated historical events. He said the people who cheered that day were, in his estimation, saying "Oh, goodie. The United States has lost a war."

<p>By the time Saigon had fallen, the American involvement was already over. We had already taken most if not all of our troops, advisers, etc out of there. It's not like the people who were cheering -- if in fact they were cheering -- were happy about the death and destruction of American troops. The bulk of the troops were long gone and the huge casualty count for our side (though not as huge as what the Vietnamese of all political stripes had suffered) had tapered off a long time before

<p>that.

<p>I think McClanahan, intentionally or not, leaves the impression that the people who cheered were doing so while the lives of American military personnel were still at stake. They were not.

<p>If people were cheering at UPI that day, it's unlikely they were cheering the defeat of America at that moment. That defeat already was a fait accompli; it was old news by the time Saigon fell. [Permalink]

<p>Why UPIers may have cheered

<p>12/14/2006 6:12:52 PM

<p>From JERRY McGINN, retired, UPI/Spokane, Olympia, San Francisco: [McGinn sent this letter to Kansas City Star columnist Thomas McClanahan and forwarded it to Romenesko]

<p>Mr. McClanahan:

<p>It's interesting that you write about how you got things so very wrong, then

<p>blast UPI Dallas staffers for cheering the day Saigon fell.

<p>I was in another hub, in sx (San Francisco), when Saigon fell and there was no such activity in the room.

<p>If indeed what you report was true in Dallas, i suggest it was because the war had ended. Since you got everything else wrong, you might want to check that out. I remember distinct national relief that the war had ended.

<p>I felt it myself.

<p>I thought about the friends I had lost and was happy that others' friends from that moment on didn't have to die. I was wrong, of course.

<p>Several friends died after years of incredible pain and suffering from wounds, both pysicial and emotional. But on that day, the operative word was relief.

<p>As for me, I was assigned to meet a plane lifting a planeload of babies from orphanages in Saigon that was to land (and did) at sx (S.F.) International.

<p>Our jobs, in other words, were not to stop working and start cheering. It was to cover the next chapter. And we did.

<p>In 21 years with UPI, covering all angles of a thousand stories lent itself to having respect for all sides -- especially when covering same.

<p>And at the end of this dismal war (Iraq) in which you apparently were a cheerleader for all the wrong reasons, there may again be relief that no one else has to die needlessly.

<p>But there will also be suffering of a different kind to take its place. In the

<p>U.S. it will be in the hospitals where the severely wounded will invest the rest of their lives trying to achieve a  modicum of normalcy, or in the homes of those who lost their loved ones (in Iraq and In the US, btw) and in the mental institutes who will attempt to erase from the memories of those who witnessed this mess to regain their lost youths or minds.

<p>And you, I predict, will get busy, soon, I suspect, latching onto another topic, or notion, and getting it wrong, and then reconciling with a cheap shot at someone else you likely will continue to misunderstand.

<p>But it's not too late for you. You could do something useful.

<p>You could latch onto the real victims of this war and deal with their stories.  They will be limping past your office, panhandling in the street, limping to and fro and their parents and spouses will be mourning their lives for generations to come.

<p>Bring them back or don't let them pass, like your mea culpa piece. Write about them. Meet their widows and kids

<p>Don't let US forget them, their sacrifices. If you do that as best you can,

<p>and never let go of the real long term effects of this cause you so wrongly beat the drum for, maybe you can really atone for the wrong you have wrought on your readers and me. And the reporters and writers in UPI Dallas, too.

<p>Maybe.
