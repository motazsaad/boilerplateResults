<p>Once Upon A One Night Stand - Sean Biggerstaff #1: The Morning After

<p>Hello, everyone! I'm the author of Second Chances? and I've decided to start another one -- a more realistic story. No, I am not going to discontinue my other one, I just wanted to try something different. Let me know what you think, okay? Ok, good. I hope you like this one as much as well.

<p>You woke up staring straight at the bright white ceiling. The fan was on high, and you were wrapped in a crisp, clean, bleach white sheet. It seemed pretty dull, and you weren't even sure exactly how you got there. Not moving, you tried to remember everything from last night. Maybe if you nudged him, he'd tell you what happened. Maybe he wouldn't and he'd just freak out and leave you there, naked wearing only a thin layer of cotton. You weren't sure. You don't remember his name, you don't remember his age, you don't remember coming back to your hotel room last night. It was all a blur. You were finally in Cancun, Mexico for spring break and you managed to get drunk the first night you hung out with your friends. Amazingly, you didn't have the urge to throw up... no, not yet, at least. Your head ached, but you weren't sure if it was because of the alcohol the prior night, or because of the current situation you were in. His chest was bare, and his skin was ivory. His slow, deep breaths made you feel somewhat calm despite the thousands of thoughts in your mind. You felt that if you even batted your eyes, the eyelashes would tickle his skin, and he'd wake up in an instant. So you closed your eyes tightly and forced yourself to go back to sleep. It wasn't exactly working. What was the worst that could happen? You had no idea, you've never been in this predicament before. This was so out of character for you. Yet, maybe, to be optimistic, nothing happened. Maybe you just fooled around a tiny bit and fell asleep. Yea, right. You knew that sounded too good to be true. You thought a bit more about getting up. If he reacted badly by the waking of your hand, it probably would be no different than him waking up himself. You figured this was the best idea, because nothing was going to change. Yet, getting up meant that you were going to walk around without a sheet, or that you'd take the sheet and leave him sleeping naked. So many decisions for stupid actions, huh? You saw the towel on the armchair close to the bed from yesterday morning when you got back from the pool. Ah hah! You thought to yourself, slowing retreating from his masculine grip. You began to make your way off the bed, but sadly his grip tightened, and he pulled you back towards him. This time, you were pulled into his chest in such a way that you could see his sleeping face. His soft, yet masculine features. His messy hair that made you smile a childish smile. He was rather attractive, you admited, and he smelled good. You gave yourself a pat on the back for the fact that you at least woke up next to someone who did not look hideous. Then you thought about how you looked right now. Would he find you attractive as well? What if he completely regrets it? Well, you couldn't say you didn't regret it either. You were still not sure what had happened. Then, as if your thoughts of not wanting to be the one who wakes him up first were read, the phone began to ring. You hastily jumped from his arms and reached for it. Sitting on the edge of the bed, you answered.

<p>"Hello...?" You whispered.

<p>"Hi, this is the morning wake up call you requested at check in." Some woman replied in a cheery tone.

<p>"Uh, thanks. I'm up." You said, afraid to look behind you, and hanging up the phone.

<p>"Am I dreaming?" You heard a voice ask.

<p>You slowly looked backwards and replied "I sure do hope so!"

<p>He sprang up so now he was sitting, and he covered his face in his hands. You grabbed your towel and begun picking up your clothes from the floor.

<p>"O' my god..." He muttered. "I cannot believe it."

<p>"I know, me neither. I'm sorry." You said sympathetically.

<p>"No, I'm sorry! It was probably my fault, anyway."

<p>"Why? Do you remember anything?" You asked intently.

<p>"I remember what happened, I don't remember how it happened." He looked up and then straight into your eyes.

<p>"Uh... I - I'm going to uh, get dressed in the bathroom." You stuttered, while heading towards that direction. You looked in the mirror and smacked yourself. You begun to get dressed and wondered why you didn't feel dirty; why you didn't have an urge to take a shower to rinse any kind of fingerprints he left on your body.

<p>You were done getting dressed and you had to admit that you looked great in what you were wearing, and that's probably how it all happened. You made a mental note not to dress up this much to go out drinking. How could your friends just let you leave with some guy you didn't even know? You felt like killing them even though you knew it was entirely your fault and responsibility.

<p>You walked out the bathroom and saw him fully dressed staring out of the balcony window.

<p>"Nice view, huh?" You asked him, coming out while tying your hair up into a ponytail.

<p>"Yea, really nice." He replied, looking you from head to toe. "The... the view, that is, of course."

<p>"Um hmm, I love it here." You said, sitting down on the bed putting your shoes on.

<p>"You come here a lot?" He asked, sitting right next to you.

<p>"Well, I've been here twice, and I love this hotel. Particularly the jacuzzi's on the roof!" You exclaimed.

<p>"Yea, I love those, too!" He said, with a twinkle in his eye.

<p>You blushed a little bit and looked down at your pale pink manicured toes.

<p>"Well, I guess this is it..." You said, getting up and walking to the door.

<p>"I guess so." He said, following you.

<p>You opened the door and no one went through it.

<p>"What are you waiting for?" You asked, impatiently.

<p>"What are you talking about? This is my room!" He snapped.

<p>"What!? No it's not, this is my room! I get wake up calls in the morning!" You said.

<p>"Me too!"

<p>"Well, I left a towel on the armchair from the pool yesterday!" You said, walking into the bathroom and showing him the towel you took in there.

<p>"Me too!" He said.

<p>"Well, my room number is 308, and this is my black suitcase!" You said, showing him the suitcase and then opening the door.

<p>The door said 306.

<p>"Wow..." You said gasping.

<p>"Yes, wow. That means, this is my room!" He said, with a sense of pride.

<p>"So then, wait." You said, walking to a door in the middle of the room. "Keep this one unlocked, okay?" He nodded. You grabbed your purse off of his dresser and walked to the room right next to him, 308. You placed your purse down, walked to your door in the middle of the room, and surprise, surprise, there he stood.

<p>"I guess we're connected." You said, with a sly smile on your face.

<p>He started laughing, "Hmm, so maybe yesterday might not have been a mistake?" He asked, even though it seemed it was more so stated to himself.

<p>"Maybe. I'm ***** *******." You held your hand out while standing in the door way.

<p>"Nice to meet you, *****. I'm Sean Biggerstaff."
