<p>Alright, Lenn, aren't you taking Microsoft's love of everything "blue" a little far here?

<p>Jeremy gets harrassed at US/Canada border

<p>Here's another blogger story I missed in the past week. Jeremy Wright got stopped at the US/Canada border because the guards there didn't believe that you could get a job as a blogger. Heh. I'll have to remember not to tell them that when I come back in the country.

<p>Anyway, some people are apparently giving Jeremy grief . That sucks. If you've ever been through the US/Canada border you know just how much a pain in the behind that experience can sometimes be. Usually it's smooth, but I've heard some horror stories. It seems they want to keep out people who are moving here for economic reasons. If you're moving here for economic reasons make sure you have all your papers and a good story to tell when coming through the border.

<p>And, Jeremy, as an American, I'm sorry for my countrymen's behavior. Welcome to America.

<p>Tony brags about Google's 20% time

<p>Tony Chang, who works at Google, brags about Google's 20% time . This is an interesting thing about Google and it sure sounds like a tempting benefit. Employees there get to spend 20% of their time working on whatever they want to work on.

<p>He thinks the reason that other companies can't implement 20% time is because other companies don't have information sharing that Google has.

<p>That's hogwash, at least in Microsoft's case. You should see the kind of information sharing we have on our intranet here. I'd be happy to give you a tour Tony. You might be shocked at the internal information sharing that goes on here. And, yes, I do have access to a lot of killer stuff over at MSN Search even though I don't work on that team and, even if that info isn't up on the intranet, you can always email a list to find the PM on the team you want to work with and then email him or her. I've done that a lot.

<p>So, why doesn't Microsoft have 20% time? Well, speaking for myself, if Bill Gates told me I could have 20% time I'd say "that's nice Bill, but I'm already working on what I want to work on." Maybe I'm a rarity at Microsoft, but I don't think so. If any employee isn't happy where he or she is, there are lots of opportunities to move around.

<p>The thing is I need 20% time to do all the work I hate to do. Like expense reports or other corporate proceedures and processes. Now if someone could take those kinds of chores away then THAT would be an employee benefit I'd really like.

<p>Porcaro survives serious burns

<p>One of the guys I really like at Microsoft, John Porcaro, reported that he suffered some serious burns a few weeks ago . He works in Xbox marketing. I totally missed this. Has pictures and stuff that are quite scary and painful looking.

<p>I just showed this to Maryam and she said "oh my God." John was at my birthday party back in January and we both really like him. He always has a positive attitude that is endearing.

<p>John, glad to see you're doing better and glad to see your sense of humor survives. Love the title of the post "burn baby burn."

<p>Wanna learn more about the AJAX development methodology? There's the Ajaxian blog .

<p>In 2004 lots of us got sick of hearing about the term "blog." Will 2005 be the year that lots of us get sick of "AJAX?"
