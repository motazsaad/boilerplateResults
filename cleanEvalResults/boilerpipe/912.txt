<h>I built my house from barley rice

<p>Green pepper walls and water ice

<p>Tables of paper wood, windows of light

<p>And everything emptying into White.

<p> 

<p>A simple garden, with acres of sky

<p>A Brown-haired dogmouse

<p>Yellow Delanie would sleep well at night

<p>With everything emptying into White.

<p> 

<p>A sad Blue eyed drummer rehearses outside

<p>A Black spider dancing on top of his eye

<p>Red legged chicken stands ready to strike

<p>And everything emptying into White.

<p> 

<p>I built my house from barley rice

<p>Green pepper walls and water ice...

<p>And everything emptying into White

<p> 

<p>On The Road To Find Out

<p> 

<p>Well I left my happy home to see what I could find out

<p>I left my folk and friends with the aim to clear my mind out

<p>Well I hit the rowdy road and many kinds I met there

<p>Many stories told me of the way to get there

<p> 

<p>So on and on I go, the seconds tick the time out

<p>There's so much left to know, and I'm on the road to find out

<p> 

<p>Well in the end I'll know, but on the way I wonder

<p>Through descending snow, and through the frost and thunder

<p> 

<p>Well, I listen to the wind come howl, telling me I have to    hurry

<p>I listen to the robin's song saying not to worry

<p> 

<p>So on and on I go, the seconds tick the time out

<p>There's so much left to know, and I'm on the road to findout

<p> 

<p>Then I found myself alone, hopin' someone would miss me

<p>Thinking about my home, and the last woman to kiss me, kiss me

<p> 

<p>But sometimes you have to moan when nothing seems to suit yer

<p>But nevertheless you know you're locked towards the future

<p> 

<p>So on and on you go, the seconds tick the time out

<p>There's so much left to know, and I'm on the road to findout

<p> 

<p>Then I found my head one day when I wasn't even trying

<p>And here I have to say, 'cause there is no use in lying, lying

<p> 

<p>Yes the answer lies within, so why not take a look now?

<p>Kick out the devil's sin, pick up, pick up a good book now

<p>
