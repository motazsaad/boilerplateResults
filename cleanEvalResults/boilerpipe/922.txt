<p>Special orders

<p>Special order items are products that are not kept in stock but are custom made upon a customer order. Examples of special order products are handmade copies of paintings and furniture (these offerings may not be available at all times). These products will be displayed as part of the catalog, but cannot be ordered via the website. To order these products, please contact Customer        Service . Please note that special order items can be paid by check or money order only.

<p>Most special order products require extensive time for delivery, usually several weeks (more detailed information is available in the catalog). When placing a special order the customer will be asked to make an advanced payment, usually 30% of the total product price. Once the product is ready for shipping, the customer will be informed via phone or e-mail and will be requested to settle the balance of the order. Product shipment will take place after this second payment is verified.

<p>The refunds or cancellation policy of special orders is the following:

<p>Changes or cancellations will be accepted at no charge until the request to manufacture the item is placed with the original item manufacturer.

<p>After the special order has been placed with the product manufacturer, a cancellation will result in the customer losing his/her advance payment. Special order changes will be accepted at our discretion, possibly for an additional charge.

<p>After the final payment, no refunds or order cancellation will be accepted on special orders.
