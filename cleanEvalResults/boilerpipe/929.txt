<h>Start getting a little strategic.

<p>You'll also start having problems- REREAD THIS BOOK!

<p>You'll start seeing why things are set up the way they are. You'll start having dillemas in placing thoughts- reread my suggested rules for subject splitting, and see if they make sense to you.

<p>You are just starting to learn this system! When you've DONE it yourself, it's a totally different thing- and VERY exciting!

<p>You'll start to see the need for P and P, and you'll start having tensions between subjects. REFLECT THEM ON THE GSMOC.

<p>Keep building new half subjects, and then promoting them to full subjects.

<p>You'll find that time is limited- NOW USE THOSE STICKY TABS!

<p>Arrange to go on your shopping trip, if you haven't already, and get the pieces that can help move you along.

<p>By this point, you shouldn't need much help.

<p>You'll see how the ideas at work here fit together, and your paper intake will increase. You'll start integrating your study and research into the system, and lining it up on the maps.

<p>You'll probably start to see little things that I knew but forgot to put in here, and you'll start to see what I mean by ``immobilizing''.

<p>And yet, if you are anything like me, you'll perceive value in this, and continue on.

<p>TIME WILL PASS.

<p>I predict:

<p>The more you think and value and reflect, the more you will be COMPELLED TO ACTION. You will gravitate towards something, or some things, and you'll see things in your head that you've never seen before. Things that are so real - you can touch them.

<p>You may question the relative significance of the physical world, compared to the realm of ideas. Things take on new dimensions.

<p>And you are COMPELLED TO ACT in NEW WAYS.

<p>EVENTUALLY:

<p>You will NEED TO STOP.

<p>And you will do so.

<p>And you will ACT.

<p>And your acts will be organized.

<p>I am just speculating now- I am the only person who has ever practiced the notebook system I am describing.

<p>But let me tell you-

<p>I HAVE NEVER COMPLETED A MAJOR PROJECT.

<p>I mean, sure, there have been some minor projects. And I have completed major WORK projects, that I was paid to complete.

<p>But I have very rarely copmleted MAJOR projects. Not that I can remember.

<p>WELL, I'm IN THE LAST LINES OF THIS BOOK.

<p>Granted, the book is rough.

<p>Granted, the book is gritty.

<p>But GOD DAMN IT, if I'm not writing on the 6,831st line..!

<p>I, who have never written a complete book, have finished this thing.

<p>Well, maybe I'm overthinking things, but this is not common in my life. I know my weaknesses, I accept them.

<p>But I have a theory: That the Notebook system is somehow a focusing system of not only THOUGHTS, but ALSO of some sort of MENTAL ENERGY. And that it BUILDS, and BUILDS, and BUILDS as you THINK, THINK, and THINK.

<p>And that when you are DONE THINKING, you are COMPELLED TO ACT.

<p>And the action WORKS.

<p>Again: I HAVE NEVER WRITTEN A BOOK.

<p>Now: To be honest, it's a shabby book. I know. I'm not an experienced writer. But here it is..! It's shabby, but it's a book! It's practice!

<p>And I am immensly proud of this.

<p>I suspect it is due to the notebook system working.

<p>So:

<p>Let me know how it works for you.

<p>I am tired now. You can tell in my writing. This has been an exhausting effort, this whole last week and a day. But it's over now.

<p>I feel like I've just lectured for a whole week straight. With work in between. So please forgive my tiredness.

<p>But I want to say:

<p>LET ME KNOW HOW IT GOES!

<p>EMAIL me: lion@speakeasy.org. Tell me, personally, how it goes.

<p>And if you implement the computer system, or want to, or want to help, or want to see how it's going, go to my web page:

<p>http://speakeasy.org/ lion/nb/

<p>...and check to see how it's going. And if it's NOT, maybe that's probably because your the first to try: Email me at lion@speakeasy.org, and let me know you want to start, and I'll link people to you.

<p>You can work together or seperate, however you like.

<p>And feel free to call me, or write to me.

<p>I LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU!

<p>Lion Kimbro   12038 31st Ave NE #201   Seattle, WA 98125

<p>206.440.0247 <- YES, you can CALL! Just say "I read your notebooks                    book."

<p>Call at whatever crazy hour. Let me know.

<p>Maybe you live in India or China or something. But if it isn't too expensive, call and let me know. I'd love to hear from you.

<p>And if you have any questions, or thoughts, or anything, feel free to let me know what they are.

<p>If you want to help with the web page, or make a discussion board, or a wiki, or SOMETHING, let me know.

<p>Oh! If you want to donate money! You can do that to. My paypal thingy is also under ``lion@speakeasy.org''.

<p>That'd be great. Then Kitty (my girlfriend) might also feel that the notebook system was worth something. <laugh>

<p>Okay.
