<p>Crocodile Cafe Seattle

<p>That night a few of us when to a bar and music venue called the Crocodile Café.  It’s one of the places that I’d heard about before I went to Seattle and wanted to visit as they have some really great bands play there.  Earlier in the week I’d seen an advertisement for a ‘Morrissey Tribute Night’ and it sounded great however I was planning to move on from Seattle by the time it was on, therefore I’d completely forgotten about it.  We went to the bar and ordered drinks, me, Sally skydive and another girl, Dan the very quiet Israeli (?) slightly odd bloke, and a cute long haired Aussie guy.  After an hour or so we decided to check out the music and lo and behold it was the ‘Morrissey Night’  I was gutted I hadn’t realised and we’d missed the first 4 bands.  I was a little drunk and spent the next 10 minutes trying to figure out if any of the bands had played ‘This Charming Man’ my favourite Smiths song.  In the process Sally and I got chatting to 2 guys who were brothers from Mexico, they had the accents but didn’t look Mexican at all.  We watched the bands and it was a great night especially when a drunken Dan decided he wanted to get on stage and literally just walked through a door and 2 minutes later appeared on the stage!
