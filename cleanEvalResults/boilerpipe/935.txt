<h>Friday Ark

<p>Cats, Dogs, Spiders and ? every Friday.

<p>I'll post links to sites that have Friday (plus or minus a few days) photos of their chosen animals as I see them (photoshops at my discretion and humans only in supporting roles).

<p>Leave a comment or trackback to this post or email me and I'll add yours to the list.  Check back regularly for updates throughout the day on Fridays and somewhat less frequently over the weekend.

<p>Dog folks: remember to submit your links to the Carnival of the Dogs hosted by Mickey's Musings .

<p>Cat folks: remember to submit your links to the Carnival of the Cats which goes up every Sunday and will be hosted this week by Running Scared .

<p>And, check out Laurence's fine graphical analysis of Friday Ark boardings.
