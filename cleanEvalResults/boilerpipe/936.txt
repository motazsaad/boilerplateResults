<p>It Starts

<p>It had been rumored that the terrorist strongholds, including Fallujah, would be reduced starting in October.

<p>And what do you know, although it's still Sept. 30 here, in Iraq it's already Oct. 1, and the offensive has begun!

<p>This is just as I had hoped. Rather than react to the provocations last Spring, that were designed to create a joint Sunni-Shia revolt, with Sadr in the South and Zarqawi to the North, we contained those uprisings without giving them the pre-packaged media victory that was sought.

<p>Rather than just level the city, we were being much smarter. The Russians levelled Grozny a few years ago, and that didn't do them any good.

<p>As operations unfolded last Spring with the Marines in Fallujah before they tried their experiment of handing security over to locals, we discovered they had perfected a new form of urban fighting that was incredibly safe for our troops and lethal for the enemy, that relied on heavy use of snipers, precision strikes, and remorseless robotic drone surveillence.

<p>Instead, we spent the Summer gathering intelligence, making databases, finding out who was who, and gradually preparing the battlespace with almost daily airstrikes on Fallujah and elsewhere.  And while holding the line with the Sunnis, we turned our attention to Sadr's Iranian-backed "Mahdi Army", and without a great deal of fanfare, exterminated them by the thousands.

<p>So now we're going in hard. They probably know exactly where the enemy is. The force is a full brigade -- that's a serious attack with several thousand soldiers and combined heavy arms.

<p>The other reason for the delay was to wait for more, better-trained Iraqi forces to follow-up our victory, which weren't available last Spring, as ultimately the ongoing security has to be provided by Iraq itself.  And there's a government for them to be loyal to.

<p>We also find

<p>senior military officials said U.S. and Iraqi troops in the past month have killed or captured more than 100 al-Zarqawi associates and have killed six members of al-Zarqawi's inner circle.

<p>I also think this is highly amusing that it starts mere hours before the first Presidential Debate. It could have been yesterday, it could have been tomorrow, but instead it's right now. Ha!

<p>Is the globe warming?

<p>Sure.

<p>Do we have anything to do with it, and can we even do anything about it?

<p>Answers to both of those questions are far less clear.

<p>What we do know is the globe was much warmer than it is now in relatively recent times, only about 1,000 years ago. That was in the Middle Ages. They weren't making much Greenhouse Gas then.

<p>The recent warming is only relative to a particularly cold spell around 1600. It was rather nasty, and is called "The Little Ice Age".  The warming since then corresponds, it turns out, to an increase in solar activity as measured by sunspots.

<p>We're actually due for another Ice Age. Wouldn't that be just grand? Imagine Boston under a sheet of ice, oh, about a mile deep!

<p>We'd be begging for a little global warming then, wouldn't we?

<p>It turns out the famous academic paper that everyone latched onto, that seemed to show temperatures shooting up in recent decades, higher than ever before, was all wrong.

<p>The authors were forced to issue a retraction in Nature magazine.

<p>You can read all about it here and here .

<p>But John Kerry says he's going to still go with junk science and reduce emissions that contribute to "global warming".

<p>What that really means is, lower your standard of living.

<p>What does Kerry care? He's got his " family " SUV. He can afford to have energy cost more without it affecting his lifestyle.

<p>How about you?  How much extra money do you have sloshing around, that you can freely spend on higher energy costs without caring?

<p>They say Bush is the candidate of the Rich.  Sure, Bush is probably like 50 times richer than I am.  But you know what?  Kerry is actually about 50 times richer than Bush!  And it's only one more step of 50-times from Kerry to Bill Gates, the world's richest man.

<p>That Kerry pretends to be the candidate of the common man, or the little guy, is something that can hardly be said with a straight face.

<p>These dour Malthusians are always wrong, always have been, and always will be.  They always want you to cut back and consume less.  Look, if a resource is finite, there's no use conserving it, as it's just going to run out anyway, and no one's ever going to do anything about it until it's gone, so you might as well use it!  Finding something new is always going to be somebody's problem in the future, what do we care exactly when that happens?

<p>The fact is, there's actually more proven oil reserves in the world today than at any point in history!  That's right, we have more and more supplies each year rather than less and less, because it's being found and exploited faster than it's being consumed.  That's hardly what I'd call "running out".  And there's lots more oil in the world than in "proven reserves"!

<p>In fact, it's not accepted yet, but there is some evidence that oil in fact is not a "fossil fuel" like coal (of which we have gargantuan quantities), but rather a substance that is being continually produced deep within the Earth!  Wouldn't that be something, if oil turned out to be renewable?

<p>I'm always surprised that people when I tell them these things aren't happy, but rather disappointed, as they hoped we'd be running out of oil so we'd turn to "cleaner" sources.

<p>One wonders just what level of immaculate cleanliness will finally satisfy them.

<p>One often hears the "statistic" that the greedy, gluttonous United States, "with only 5% of the world's population, consumes 30% of the world's resources!"  I got news for ya, that's deliberately constructed to mislead.  As if our "consumption" of any particular "resource" prevented someone else from using all they needed!

<p>You're supposed to imagine a fixed pie, you see, and we're grabbing a bigger slice than is fair, when everyone else goes hungry with the crumbs.  That's not how it works!  The other half of the story is we produce 30% of all the world's goods and services with those resources!

<p>In a closed system, consumption equals production, by definition.  I mean really, we only "consume" a resource in order to process it into something else.  And if we didn't "consume" it, wouldn't the other countries that wanted to export it to us to sell for money so they could buy food be really unhappy if we stopped "consuming" what they had to offer?  If we didn't "consume" so much, the rest of the world would fall into poverty!

<p>But the "environmentalists" who dreamed up that saying know that, but they want to mislead you to thinking we're taking the bread out of the mouths of Third Worlders, just to make you feel guilty about being an American, and to despise the Capitalist system that creates enormous wealth and prosperity.

<p>I've listened to many of these people, and in unguarded moments they always reveal the same wish: that 4 or 5 billion people would be killed off, preferably by something we were ourselves responsible for, and then the rest (including, presumably, themselves), would live in some fantasy pre-modern Eden, in tune with Mother Earth (oh, I'm sorry, " Gaia "), and in harmony with Nature, completely non-exploitively, whatever that means.

<p>Somehow they imagine modern medicine will still magically survive, and that mana will fall from heaven, or the fields will clear and sow themselves.

<p>Get a Grip

<p>The naysayers are out in force. For example, James Fallows argues the Iraq war was a terrible distraction:

<p>Among the opportunities lost, Fallows argues, were a chance to reassess our "inglorious bargain" with Saudi Arabia, a chance to wage a comprehensive war on terror, and a chance to improve the situation in Afghanistanâ€”all amid a climate of international solidarity that followed September 11.

<p>Perhaps the most worrisome development, Fallows suggests, concerns the threat posed by the other members of the "axis of evil"â€”the ones that we know have or are developing weapons of mass destruction. With our standing in the international community diminished, our military considerably weakened, and the trustworthiness of our intelligence in doubt, he explains, Iran and North Korea have much less to fear from America than they did before Iraq: "the United States now has no good options for dealing with either country."

<p>Get a Grip!

<p>I don't find it convincing. Assume there was no Iraq war. Then what? All sorts of magic seems to happen. Let's even assume Afghanistan, because of that, somehow vaulted to a modern, rebuilt, thriving Eden. How does that really help us? What extra measures could be taken against NK and Iran? It doesn't lay out how we'd stop those programs -- would the rest of the world just like us more and so do our bidding?

<p>Not likely.

<p>NK already has the bomb, we'd still have no direct easy military option regardless of the Iraq war! We can't go back in time to the Clinton administration and change that! In fact, NK is stalling further talks until AFTER the U.S. election -- obviously hoping to hold out for a Kerry Presidency!

<p>You got that? The Evil Dwarf of Pyongyang is hoping for Kerry win so he can keep forcing his people to resort to cannibalism and eating grass to avoid starvation.

<p>Actions have consequences. Think very hard about who around the world will benefit and rejoice from a Kerry win, and who will will be crushed and dispirited.

<p>With millions of oppressed souls hoping for a Bush win, to vote for Kerry under these circumstances just to feel better about yourself at the coffee house with all your pseudointellectual friends -- when the man doesn't even have any coherent policy anyone can articulate -- is sinful self-indulgence worthy of nothing but scorn.

<p>Sure, Bush has made mistakes. He's not all we might want. But does anyone honestly believe Kerry will be more aggressive in waging the WWIV?

<p>Or will he cut and run under some sort of "peace with honor" rhetoric?

<p>With respect to Iran, we're working hard -- very hard -- to get Europe to support security council sanctions, and they're refusing. Not going into Iraq wouldn't change that. There's nothing to stop us from bombing Iran, and being in Iraq makes it SO much easier to do so!

<p>Also, the draining air patrols of the no-fly zones over Iraq we had been maintaining for 12 years are over, which has really freed up the air force. We couldn't be BETTER positioned to launch sustained punitive strikes into Iran!

<p>In fact, one might argue that if Bush lost a year, then heck, we need to give him 4 more to finish up! Not following through on regime change everywhere in the Middle East WOULD turn this into a lost, wasted cause.

<p>So how would more "attention" to those problems make them go away, as if thinking about them equates to solving them? There are no purely diplomatic solutions to Iran or NK.

<p>Would Arabs stop using terrorism because a completely different ethnic group is being successful in Afghanistan? Would inspectors still be in Iraq, or would they have long departed, allowing him to start up his nuclear weapons programs that everyone agrees he had waiting in the wings?

<p>The basic problem with their analysis is its fundamental view of the source of terrorism. It believes it comes down to our "policies", meaning support of Israel; they seem to imply more Arab-friendly policies would get them off our back, which is a recipe for appeasement.

<p>Instead, the real root cause has to be addressed, and the only way to do that is what we're trying to do: inject the virus of liberty and capitalism and modernism directly into the heart of the Arab world. And we've positioned ourselves strategically to strangle Iran and pressure Syria, the last 2 big bastions of terror-supporting regimes in the Middle East.

<p>The critics don't provide any alternate concrete plan, other than to imply things would magically be better without the mistakes they can easily point to in hindsight. Attacks have increased? That's not the measure of success! Of course they will increase, because we've ratcheted up the war and turned it hot. That's like complaining that battles with Germans increased in 1943 and 1944, ignoring that the battleline was moving closer and closer to Berlin. The real question is WHERE the terror attacks are happening -- and they're not happening here, they've been confined to the Muslim world and the underside of Europe, which is pushing back the battleline.

<p>I can't understand the metrics these critics are using. They lack all sense of scale with history.

<p>Quagmire? In the last 6 months, since the "uprising" started, our casualty rate has been under 3/day. By comparison, in 1968, it was 41/day over that worst year. In ww2, is was 205/day. Civil War, 480/day. The Germans were losing 2,500/day in ww2, and the Soviets 10,000/day -- and that's what winning looked like!

<p>Then these complaints that we're "using up" the reserves? That's what they're for! Rather than being "stretched", the army is getting stronger, as everyone is turning into an experienced veteran.

<p>We can strike them wherever they are. It's a big country, having more troops doesn't really help with that. The question is, are there missions not being performed because of too few troops?The answer is no, from what I'm hearing, both in Iraq and Afghanistan. They're not there to patrol like cops, there could never even in principle ever be enough to do that, that's for local forces.

<p>The true "root cause" of Islamic terrorism is a combination of a lack of modernity, capitalism, and liberty, ignited by a literalist Islamic ideology, and evangelized by Saudi and Iranian money and clerics. If Saudi is going to come down, Iraq's oil had to be freed from an unfriendly tyrant first as a strategic move for the sake of the world's economy: China and Japan need foreign oil even more than we do. If Iran is going to come down without driving the friendly population to support the mullahs by invading, it could be done easily by a blockade of its one-dimensional export-dependent economy, which requires sealing its borders, which means having troops in Afghanistan and Iraq and free use of the Gulf without interference of Hussein's missiles and provocations, which all required as a first-step strategic move the invasion of Iraq.

<p>While many of the armchair strategists, including myself, are enormously frustrated by lack of decisive retaliation in Fallujah, and of sparing the mosque at Najaf -- the Jacksonian impulse is to level the places -- there could be a good reason.

<p>Either the Bushies are all micromanaging dopes who suddenly got squeamish, or they're (including the generals) incredibly level-headed professionals making shrewd game-theory decisions. The whole plan of the terror masters was specifically to create "events" in Fallujah and Najaf, to provoke an overwhelming response, for which they had set up many women and children to be casualties for propaganda purposes, all captured on al-Jazeera cameras. Iran was hoping we'd bomb the mosque!

<p>The major strategies of our opponents in Iraq -- to try to ignite a civil war and/or a general uprising against us -- is failing miserably! In a country of over 20 million people, at most 0.1% are mobilized against us, and many of those are foreign imports.

<p>By not giving them what they want, their staged events become apparent tactical victories for them but actual strategic defeats. We keep Sadr around because he's so inept - the risk is someone better might replace him!

<p>Syria and Iran and even the Saudis realize they cannot survive long if Iraq is transformed. They're pulling out all the stops. Terror and the states that support it are not distinct -- Iraq is indeed the central theatre in the GWOT, as it focuses all our enemy's efforts there.

<p>It's really al-Qaeda that's the sideshow. The critics are complaining we're not going after the mosquitoes, when the real solution is to drain the swamp of the states that support them. That requires changing all those societies by dragging them out of the middle ages.  Don't miss the forest for the trees!

<p>The Problem With Democrats

<p>The big problem with the Democrats today is they lack any purpose, apparently, other than pursuing power at all costs, even to the detriment of the country.

<p>That's because they succeeded marvelously in enacting all their major socially progressive programs that were their prime raison d'etre over the last century, and have simply outlived their usefulness.

<p>Workers' rights? Check. Social Security? Yep. Unemployment? Civil Rights? Education programs? We've got it all.

<p>And we thank them for it. Really.

<p>These programs are imperfect, but they function in the real world, given finite resources. No, all poverty and misfortune and injustice have not been purged from society, but they never will be. Conservatives, distrustful of large government programs, are satisfied with "good enough"; idealistic revolutionaries are never happy until perfection is achieved, even if it means fascistically stomping on people "in the way" of "progress".

<p>It is a combination of this partial success, along with general American optimism, that makes class warfare a losing issue for the Democrats, even with many of the working class. Not everything in life is economic, and even then, many harbor the desire to become rich and don't want to find that being rich has been outlawed once they get there!

<p>This is described at a bit more length in this Peggy Noonan article .

<p>The social programs in place may be tinkered with, but they are not going away. And pushing them further and making them bigger just leads to prohibitively high taxes and regulation that drags down all growth and expansion.

<p>The one thing the Left has never come to grips with is where production comes from.

<p>What, stuff just falls from heaven everyday, does it?

<p>In physics, it's a Law of Thermodynamics that useful work cannot be extracted from a heat engine unless a temperature differential exists: you get heat energy to flow from the hot place to the cold place, and in the process can divert some of it into work.

<p>I believe a similar concept must apply in Economics: useful economic activity cannot take place unless there exist differences in wealth across which money will flow. The richer person has the disposable cash to spend, the poorer person has an incentive to do work to get that money.

<p>It's an unpleasant system, but otherwise there's no incentive for any economic activity.

<p>And then everyone's equally poor.

<p>One might wish otherwise, but that's reality.

<p>The small businessman -- not an elite, country-club figure at all -- is more likely to identify with Republicans once they find the tangle of laws and taxes and hoops and red-tape they have to go through just to try to start up their business!

<p>So just "more of the same" from the Democrats is not welcome. And they are not needed to preserve what has already been won.

<p>Unable to reinvent themselves, they seem to be simply grasping for power for its own sake, and it's quite unbecoming.

<p>I listen to these Democrat attack dogs making insane proclamations that Iraq was never a threat, and we're less safe now, and only turned Iraq into a terrorist "haven" by invading.

<p>Even assuming that last point were true, isn't that exactly what we'd like, to create a high concentration of terrorists in a country other than our own, that also just happens to host half our army with free reign to strike the terrorists whenever they are found?

<p>I can't believe these people truly believe the illogical nonsequitors they spout. They can only be engaging in sophistry and rhetoric for the sake of winning debating points, and they have to know it.

<p>And to do so in the middle of a war, with lives on the line every day, merely for their own ambitions, is the very definition of disloyalty.

<p>Yes, the Democrat party is disloyal to America.

<p>Disloyal! Seditious! Traitorous!

<p>In the present circumstances, I can't possibly understand how anyone can justify a vote for a member of this party, let alone for positionless Kerry-Kerry-Quite-Contrary. Nostalgia isn't a good enough reason. What have Democrats done for us lately?

<p>Their behavior is disgraceful and unjustifiable -- except in their own minds because their "cause" is "good".

<p>Ever notice that the Left is always about Motive? That's all that matters. Purity of Motive. They strive for some social Utopia, so any atrocity or dirty trick is allowed, nay, even demanded, in pursuit of that Greater Good! Witness trying to steal the 2000 election by corrupt recounts, or the willful use of forged documents in Rathergate.

<p>But the obvious good of freeing 50 million people from terrible, oppressive totalitarians of the very worst sort is derided by the Left, simply because they don't trust Bush's Motives. The tangible outcome for the liberated is less important to the Left than the pleasure of refusing to give credit to Bush because he has to be driven by oil or Halliburton or Karl Rove, rather than by high-minded ideals of social justice.

<p>What miserable, useless people!

<p>Some, however, have seen the light: witness this interview with former Lefty Christopher Hitchens, in which the interviewer is appalled at his 9/11 conversion to neo-conservatism, when the scales were finally burned from his eyes by what happened that day, and he saw that mere political points were less important than, you know, fighting real Evil.

<p>And this Evil isn't Capitalism or "the Man", it's Islamic Fascism.

<p>And it's new ally, the anti-bourgeoisie (and hence anti-American) Left.

<p>Clarification

<p>A clarification to the previous posting, "Elections & Foreigners" -- it was implied, but perhaps not obvious, that when I was talking about foreign opinions not mattering, it was intended specifically with respect to United States policies. I did not mean that in a broader sense!

<p>As a further example, I recall this same Portugese student was also at the time circulating petitions in support of gun bans, which I felt was outrageous meddling in our affairs, especially as he was not planning on living here very long anyway.

<p>And my recommendation is for them to strengthen themselves so as not to be overly pre-occupied with U.S. issues, rather than demanding a vote to compensate their own weakness.

<p>This illustrates the impulse behind claims we must be beholden to the United Nations, which in effect gives the rest of the world an unearned veto power over our actions.

<p>Elections & Foreigners

<p>Back in the early 90s, whilst in graduate school, a fellow student in the physics department who was from Portugal (and was a rather bright fellow), would make comments to the effect that the United States was the source of all the world's problems, and the only way there would ever truly be lasting peace would be if all the other countries in the world got together "to smash the U.S."

<p>Such a patently absurd, not to mention rude, point of view caused me great consternation for quite some time.

<p>Until I realized, with contented satisfaction, that this person's opinions mattered not one teensie tiny little bit in the big scheme of things, because he was not an American, and couldn't vote in our elections.

<p>But my opinion did matter.

<p>The most powerful government in the world courts my vote, not his.

<p>And thus he was as ignorable as the inconsequential brayings of a jackass.

<p>I found it further ironic (beyond the obvious point of him coming here to study) that although he could have become an American, as our way of life is theoretically open to all, and thus elevated himself to having opinions of significance, I doubted I could have ever become Portugese if I wanted to; they even have official lists of approved Portugese names for babies that must be used on all birth certificates there, so not being native born I would surely not be welcome.

<p>And of course he (and his wife who was also studying here) planned to go back to Portugal -- a kind of Workers Paradise, to hear him describe it -- to raise a family, as it was just so horrible and violent here.

<p>He was apoplectic over my explanation of how deadly force was allowed in most states to defend one's home against intruders -- to him this was barbaric and he couldn't understand why there wasn't an epidemic of people just inviting their enemies over for tea and then freely murdering them by claiming they were intruders.

<p>Anyway, it seems they're finally on to us, realizing their impotence: witness this article making a case that the rest of the world should be able to vote in U.S. elections because the outcome will affect them. They even have the gall to quote the Declaration of Independence:

<p>That 1776 declaration is worth rereading. Its very first sentence demands "a decent respect to the opinions of mankind": isn't that exactly what the world would like from America today? The document goes on to excoriate the distant emperor George for his recklessness, insisting that authority is only legitimate when it enjoys "the consent of the governed". As the world's sole superpower, the US now has global authority. But where is the consent?

<p>It's a novel passive/aggressive argument: claiming a right to political power precisely due to their being so supine and weak as to be unable to govern themselves.

<p>Bite me.

<p>Same-sex "marriage"

<p>There are very good reasons to strongly oppose same-sex "marriage" that have absolutely nothing to do with appeals to religion or morality, and even have nothing at all to do with gayness (which is why I call it "same-sex").

<p>This is an important issue because it strikes at the very foundations of the most basic of human civilizational institutions, and is pertinent due to decreed legalization in Massachusetts, which will lead to possible national imposition via the "full faith and credit" clause of the Constitution -- all that will take is the whim of 5 unelected liberal Supreme Court justices.

<p>The first objection is procedural. The second is on the substance (or lack thereof).

<p>First, marriage cannot possibly be a Natural Right , since what they're really asking for is the benefits that come with it, which are, well benefits. And as such are rightfully the province of of the Legislature, not of the Courts. Otherwise we are ruled by an aristocracy.

<p>I mean, what, is same-sex marriage more obviously an inherent Constitutional Right than, say, oh, woman having the vote?

<p>That's a plainly stupid proposition and you all know it.

<p>And yet, did the Suffragettes go and get a judge to declare women should have the Right to vote? No, they did not, because it was not Constitutionally obvious.

<p>Instead, they did what the rules of our system dictated, and went out, and made their case, and got the XIXth Amendment passed.

<p>And it was a long struggle, and they earned that Right.

<p>And yet somehow it's clearer that marriage, the oldest human institution, that predates all known religions and even civilization itself, and was never ever anywhere in the world in any culture at any time ever applied to same-sex couples, is more fundamentally a Right than women having the vote.

<p>Yeah. Sure. If I were a woman, I'd be outraged at the notion.

<p>I'm outraged enough as it is!

<p>I mean look, the whole thing has been turned on its head: instead of gays having to make the case why same-sex marriage is a great idea and trying to pass an Amendment to say so, we've been put in the position of having to pass an Amendment to squelch what should be an obvious absurdity.  It is truly insane that this claim of an abridgement of an imaginary "right" is taken seriously for more than a nanosecond.

<p>Now, our libertarian friends will claim that it's not government's business who gets married to whom, and shouldn't be up to government to decide who can and can't. Which is up to a point true: government (and society) really doesn't care who is shacking up with whom, as far as that goes. But it's a silly argument to make, when they then turn around and claim that then all of a sudden government should administer certain legal protections and benefits to the married couple!

<p>Talk about wanting it both ways!

<p>This also takes care of the "Equality" argument. The fact is, gays already have all the Equality they could possibly hope for when it comes to living their lives!

<p>First of all, gays can get married -- to someone of the opposite sex, just like anyone else. And that's not a facetious argument.

<p>Second, there's nothing stopping any of them from having a ceremony to declare their Lifepartnerhood with their beloved, and having all their friends and family applaud and recognize their love, and then living openly as a gay couple for the rest of their lives, especially with the Lawrence v. Texas decision which outlawed anti-sodomy laws.

<p>From the libertarian point of view, then, gays have already achieved full equality and freedom in their relationships, without any government interference.

<p>Nobody is stopping them. And if some church or whatever group wants to hold a ceremony, more power to them.

<p>But when they then demand government step in and force everyone else in the country to not merely tolerate, but outright celebrate their union, and bestow it with a special set of benefits, it is completely disingenuous to not expect society (by way of government) to have any say in defining who can be married!

<p>The point that is missed is that marriage is not merely about Lifepartnerhood.

<p>If it were, then of course there could not be any objections to same-sex "marriage".

<p>But marriage is specifically about, at its core, uniting the two different sexes of our species.

<p>That's what it means.

<p>That's always been its point.

<p>Which gets to the substantive argument that same-sex "marriage" is a gargantuan oxymoron .

<p>It's only because we've forgotten what marriage is about, in our modern world of abundance and leisure, that revolves around our self-gratification. Marriage has come to be seen merely as an expression of self-actualization, and perhaps a declaration of love for another individual.

<p>And that's nice and all, but really, who cares?

<p>I mean good for you if you found your Soulmate, but why does anyone expect the rest of us give a damn?

<p>Why does that in itself justify any recognition or support from society?

<p>It doesn't.

<p>People have become so accustomed to entitlements that they just assume for some reason that declaring "marriage" is somehow license to essentially open a big bridal registry to be satisfied from the public till.

<p>They forget marriage is recognized and supported and subsidized by society because it serves a useful social purpose: bonding a male to a female.

<p>And by definition, same-sex unions simply do not serve that social purpose!

<p>Bonding a male to a female benefits society in two key ways. First, obviously the Tyranny of Testosterone dictates that it is males that cause almost all mischief, violence, and mayhem in society -- and especially "rogue", single males. But when bonded to a woman, this instinct is calmed.

<p>That's just a fact. That's why, for instance, driver's insurance rates instantly drop for when when they tie the knot. It's in the cold, hard, actuarial tables that married men become safer, less aggressive drivers.

<p>The female is clearly a civilizing influence on the male, when a relationship is committed to. And clearly, a same-sex union does not produce this effect.

<p>The second key reason is of course the children that are expected to be produced. Even couples who do not intend to have children will always have the future option to. And a man-woman couple is better for raising children than a same-sex couple.

<p>Yes, that's right! Now of course I'm not saing a gay person can't be a fine parent.

<p>Don't put such a silly argument into my mouth, and simmer down, and listen to what I'm really saying, rather than having a hissy-fit.

<p>I take it as given that a gay person can be just as good a parent -- no better, no worse -- than a heterosexual person.

<p>But the average hetero couple will ALWAYS be FAR better than the average gay couple as parents.

<p>Why? Because the hetero couple provides the child with both important psychological role models of a male father and a female mother.

<p>Lacking either a mother or a father is a serious, serious blow to a child.

<p>And a gay couple will always lack one of those!!!

<p>There's no way around that fact.

<p>We might wish it to be otherwise, but it's not.

<p>The unpleasant truth is gay couples do their children a disservice.  The child is in fact put in a terrible, untenable position of feeling like they should defend their gay parents out of loyalty, and yet knowing they were deliberately robbed of half their developmental experience.

<p>And society should not celebrate that fact.

<p>Sure, you can show me some anecdotal cases of outstanding gay couples raising children, and of poor hetero couples who are terrible as parents. So what? Public policy should never be driven by the exceptions!

<p>There will be some overlap, but everyone must concede it's mathematically certain the average hetero couple will be better, because of the male-female synergy, unless you resort to claiming gays are somehow individually superior as parents. And thus the best will also be better than the best gay couples.

<p>And that's even if they decide to have children, which most won't, which again points out the lack of a reason for society to recognize it.  Social-policy and Law are meant for the general case; the exceptions -- in either direction -- are not relevant.

<p>And now we see why the claim that opposing the "civil right" of gays to marry is the same as attempts to outlaw marriage between the races fails, because the male-female bond between different races is not diminished, and thus there's no good reason for banning such unions because they serve the same basic purpose for which marriage is intended -- which same-sex marriage does not.

<p>It makes no sense for society to give the same recognition to different things that are of unequal utility.  If we intend to do so merely out of magnanimity, the risk is great that marriage will be further weakend as its true reaons for existence get further and further ignored.  It will indeed then be dumbed-down to mere Lifepartnerhood.

<p>We've apparently already gone far in that direction; time to reverse course!

<p>Look, it's like arguing that the numbers "1" and "2" should be equal.  I mean, look, poor number 1 is always feeling overshadowed by 2.  Wouldn't it be nice if they could be the same?   Yeah, it would, but guess what, 1 does not equal 2, no matter how much we might wish it so.

<p>And I repeat, nobody is stopping any gay couple from having a ceremony to declare their unending devotion! It's claiming their relationship has the same social utility, and hence status, as marriage that is absurd on its face.

<p>All the relevant rights to live as they choose are already granted; remaining legal issues can be handled by private contracts.

<p>The burden of proof, then, is on the gays to convince us of why their relationship should have special societal recognition, when weighed against the risks of weakening an institution that's already in decline.  And that cannot be done.

<p>The real reason people support gay marriage is merely to show how ostentatiously "tolerant" they are, which is nothing but Vanity.

<p>Woo-hoo, again!

<p>Wow, more good news !

<p>JERUSALEM - Israel's claim to have killed a Hamas leader in the Syrian capital on Sunday marked an escalation in the Jewish state's war against the violent group, embarrassed Syrian leaders and turned up pressure on Damascus to expel Palestinian militants.

<p>The explosion in a Damascus suburb killed Izz Eldine Subhi Sheik Khalil, a leader of the Hamas military wing, in what was described by an Israeli commentator as an intricate operation in hostile territory and an example of Israel's long reach.

<p>The breaking of the old "taboos" of sanctuaries for the mass-murdering enemies of civilization continues apace.  These are fantastic developments.  Half-measures only prolong conflicts.

<p>Behold, Damascus will cease from being a city, And it will be a ruinous heap.  --Isaiah 17:1

<p>Woo-hoo!

<p>US President George W. Bush says "all options are on the table" for making sure Iran dismantles its nuclear program, and that Washington will never let Tehran acquire atomic weapons.

<p>Well now, that's pretty unequivocal, and the best news I've heard in a long time.

<p>Why?  The key to winning -- actually winning, as opposed to "managing" -- the War on Islamic Fascism, is eliminating the rogue states that provide sanctuary, support, and potentially -- and most dangerously for the continuance of Life as We Know It(tm) -- nuclear weapons.

<p>And such states are far easier to deal with if they lack nuclear weapons -- which is why our options are already limited in dealing with North Korea (thanks a lot, Jimmy and Madeline, you pathetic fools).

<p>Without the support of these states -- and their number is dwindling -- social network theory is indicating that terrorist groups like al-Qaeda must necessarily fracture down to relatively manageable groups of 80-150 members at most, or else their security is blown.

<p>Small groups like that cannot wage any kind of sustainable campaigns, and do indeed become mere law-enforcement issues.

<p>But with the backing of a state, with diplomatic privileges, passports, and other resources, they can safely grow to larger sizes and become potentially unstoppable, undeterrable delivery vehicles for WMD, which threatens our very civilization.

<p>And an Iranian nuclear capability would make destroying their evil theocracy infinitely harder.

<p>Now we finally have a statement from the White House, that indicates they understand this.

<p>This is the only issue that should matter in the next election, because all other issues depend, you know, on us being alive.

<p>Or at least not under martial law.

<p>And Kerry's position , stated on his website, is to give Iran nuclear fuel to help them along on their "peaceful" project...And if that fails, well, he'll try to get the IAEA to refer them to the hopelessly divided and ineffectual Security Council...

<p>I'm sure that has them quaking in their boots!

<p>The argument that he really doesn't mean that, and that cooler heads will prevail in the end, is ludicrous on two counts.  First, nobody stopped a similarly ridiculous plan to "help" North Korea that way in the 90s.  And second, the people making that argument are the very same ones who denigrate Bush as some kind of puppet that only does as he's told, as distinct from Kerry, who is ostensibly smarter and has real ideas...except when it comes to this idea, when Kerry is DEFENDED by arguing he's, well, nothing but a puppet who is going to do as he's told.

<p>Whaaaa???
