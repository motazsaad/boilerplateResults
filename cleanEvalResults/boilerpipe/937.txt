<h>lyrics by EH Harburg and music by Harold Arlen

<p>(DOROTHY)

<p>When all the world is a hopeless jumble

<p>And the raindrops tumble all around

<p>Heaven opens a magic lane

<p>When all the clouds darken up the skyway

<p>There's a rainbow highway to be found

<p>Leading from your window pane

<p>To a place behind the sun

<p>Just a step beyond the rain

<p>Somewhere over the rainbow way up high

<p>There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby

<p>Somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue

<p>And the dreams that you dare to dream

<p>Really do come true

<p>Some day I'll wish upon a star

<p>And wake up where the clouds are far behind me

<p>Where troubles melt like lemon drops

<p>Away above the chimney tops

<p>That's where you'll find me

<p>Somewhere over the rainbow blue birds fly

<p>Birds fly over the rainbow

<p>Why then, oh why can't I?

<p>If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

<p>Why oh why can't I?

<p>(Glinda)

<p>Come out, come out wherever you are

<p>And meet the young lady who fell from a star

<p>She fell from the sky, she fell very far

<p>And Kansas she says is the name of the star

<p>(Munchkins)

<p>Kansas she says is the name of the star

<p>(Glinda)

<p>She brings you good news, or haven't you heard

<p>When she fell out of Kansas a miracle occurred

<p>(Dorothy)

<p>It really was no miracle

<p>What happened was just this:

<p>The wind began to switch the house to pitch

<p>And suddenly the hinges started to unhitch

<p>Just then the witch, to satisfy an itch

<p>Went flying on her broomstick thumbing for a hitch

<p>(Munchkin Man)

<p>And oh what happened then was rich

<p>(Munchkins)

<p>The house began to pitch, the kitchen took a slitch

<p>It landed on the wicked witch in the middle of a ditch

<p>Which was not a healthy situation for the wicked witch

<p>The house began to pitch, the kitchen took a slitch

<p>It landed on the wicked witch in the middle of a ditch

<p>Which was not a healthy situation for the wicked witch

<p>Who began to twitch, and was reduced to just a stitch

<p>Of what was once the wicked witch

<p>(Munchkin 1)

<p>We thank you very sweetly for doing it so neatly

<p>(Munchkin 2)

<p>You've killed her so completely

<p>That we thank you very sweetly

<p>(Glinda)

<p>Let the joyous news be spread

<p>The wicked, old witch at last is dead

<p>(Munchkins)

<p>Ding-dong the witch is dead

<p>Which old witch? The wicked witch

<p>Ding-dong the wicked witch is dead

<p>Wake up you sleepyhead

<p>Rub your eyes, get out of bed

<p>Wake up the wicked witch is dead

<p>She's gone where the goblins go

<p>Below - below - below

<p>Yo-ho, let's open up and sing and ring the bells out

<p>Ding Dong' the merry-oh, sing it high, sing it low

<p>Let them know the Wicked Witch is dead

<p>(Mayor)

<p>As mayor of the Munchkin City

<p>In the county of the land of Oz

<p>I welcome you most regally

<p>(Judge)

<p>But we've got to verify it legally

<p>To see...
