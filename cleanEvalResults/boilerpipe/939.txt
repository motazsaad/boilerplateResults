<h>support my mind, please

<p>Dear LPs,

<p>few month ago I posted the same question, leaving or staying? I did not get a point, I am confused without any plans. Already 4 years ago I had my gap year and travelled through Australia. I loved it, but when I flew home and also spent time in SEA like Cambodia, Thailand and Laos I got the effect of travelling. I cannot stop thinking of going again, I am back into my normal life I am back at the same job - actually things I already wanted to change before I left the first time. With my heart I am always on the way, I know its good for me to go again. On the other side there are my parents, my friends. my kolleques and nobody ever understand me. The put a bad, very bad conscience in my mind. When I turn back of a one year travelling I am 30 and I will never find a job easy. Economic in Germany is getting worse every day, and prices go up every day also. I must be happy of having a save job, today! Thats the opinion of everybody. There are about 15 close people around me and nobody is on my side. Nobody! And I think it brakes my conviction.

<p>I know this is a traveller forum, and of course you all ganna tell me, Inge go, but is there s ... more inside
