<p>Before we made an offer to buy a Honda Accord last year, I went to the 'Prices Paid' forum and tried to determine how much others were paying.  I was amazed that some people claimed they were buying Accords for $500 under invoice.

<p> 

<p>We computed an OTD price based on $500 under invoice, went to a Honda dealer, made an offer, and they accepted.

<p> 

<p>I have no idea how much Tributes are selling for, so I can't say if your offer makes any sense at all.

<p> 

<p>From my experience, the TMV price here at Edmunds is way too high.

<p> 

<p>Of course, your offer will probably be refused.  If you walk out, there is a good chance they will change their mind and accept your offer.  That's how it has been with our last three car purchases.
