<p>A meeting is scheduled for Monday 3rd June 2002 at 17h30 in the Committee Room to discuss the development of the clubhouse.

<p>Those Sub-Clubs who have not attended previous meetings are urged to attend, as it is important to get input from a broad spectrum of members.

<p>On 16 May 2002 the Old Edwardian Society held its annual Sportsman of the Year function. The ceremony was held to reward the exceptional sportsmen within the Old Edwardian Society who had represented South Africa at the highest levels during the 2001 season.

<p>All the different sub-clubs, namely, Athletics, Basketball, Bowls, Cricket, Hockey (men and women), Rugby, Soccer, Swimming, Synchronised Swimming, Tennis, Waterpolo, and Wargames all had candidates that they had nominated for the ultimate accolades from the Society.

<p>David Webster

<p>who had represented South Africa since 1997 in international games and who came fifth in the 2001 Individual Wargames Championships was once again a finalist for the Sportsman of the year Award.

<p>However, it was young Matthew Strachan who brought the silverware home when he was awarded the trophy for Junior Sportsman of the Year which he shares with Greg Smith who represented South Africa in the Under 19 Cricket team in India.

<p>The award was awarded to Matthew in recognition of his sterling achievement in respect of his winning the Junior World Wargames Championships in 2001.

<p>Wargames was to receive yet another accolade. For five years the Wargames club had been a finalist for the Best Sub Club award, but the award had always eluded the wargames club. The Cricket sub-club seemed to have an almost ironclad monopoly on the award. Thus the wargames section as most pleasantly surprised to be awarded the trophy for the Best Sub Club.

<p>Club members who attended the function are: (from left to front)

<p>Richard Ligault, Matthew Strachan, Vincent Lane, Kevin Hoyle, Colin Webster, Marc Marais, David Webster and Benji Shulman (in front) with the trophy

<p>30 September 2001

<p>The Old Edwardian wargames Club held its annual doubles championships on the weekend of 29 and 30 September 2001 at the Old Edwardian Society in Lower Houghton.

<p>The championship attracted the cream of South African figure gamers with over 70% of all players who had received junior and senior national colours in the past three years attending the championship. In fact the championship showed a net growth of 50% of total entries compared to 2000.

<p>With all the big names present, it was expected that the doubles pairs that included Kevin Hoyle and or David Webster would shine if not walk away with first place.

<p>But it was not to be...

<p>Few players expected the team comprising Matthew Strachan (2001 Junior World Champion) and Max Shabangu, of the Old Edwardian Wargames Club, to do quite so well.

<p>Ever since Matthew attended the World Championships in Epsom in the UK in April this year his standard has improved beyond expectation. Notwithstanding his own success Matthew has taken the time and trouble to take newcomer Max Shabangu under his wing as part of a mentor system.

<p>Needless to say, Max Shabangu began to improve in leaps and bounds.

<p>The doubles team of Max Shabangu and Matthew Strachan went into the championship well trained and extremely well motivated. Whereas other doubles teams of the more experienced senior players failed to work efficiently, Max and Matthew immediately fell into sync and defeated one pair after another. Only the doubles pair of David Webster and Nicholas Clare managed to inflict a loss on Max and Matthew, a loss which came to late to stop Max and Matthew from romping home to take first place.

<p>The final top three positions were:

<p>1st Max Shabangu and Matthew Strachan

<p>2nd Kevin Hoyle and Heloise Ehlers

<p>3rd Vincent Lane and Andre Tonkin
