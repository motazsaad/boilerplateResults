<h>If you have a hot idea that will help us, send Rummy an e-mail.

<p>If you have a pessimistic view of things and spread them around...the effect is different.

<p>It is impossible to say that publicly-stated views of pessimism don't encourage the terrorists.  I don't say they "help" the terrorists, since it would be better for all of us, including them, if they quit now.  So encouraging them to hang on isn't necessarily "helping" them.

<p>The point is that, since the end of WW II, the only important terrain in a war involving the US is the six inches between the ears of the American voter.  Our enemies work hard at assessing the status of that terrain, of the effects of their efforts.  If they think they are on the right path, they will be encouraged to persevere.

<p>This isn't new to you and the advice, which is that if you want to have a conclusion, keep it to yourself or it will have an effect (which you may or may not like, and may or may not admit seeking).

<p>You have a right to have an effect, but not a right to be considered innocent if the effect seems determined to be in opposition to our aims.

<p>And your motivation doesn't matter a hoot.

<p>But, then, we're not talking exclusively about your motivation.

<p>We're talking about people who are considerably more obnoxious than offering good advice.

<p>I tend not to think that people writing this sort of explanation of a faction's viewpoint agree with that faction, merely because I tend to compose such viewpoint-explanations all the time about every person and faction I encounter, sort of a running monologue of "here's how they see themselves."

<p>This doesn't mean I agree with absolutely everyone - it just means I like to try to understand how they are motivated.

<p>I suspect I would write something very similar about the Iraqi, were I to attempt it, and something just as sympathetic about the forces arrayed to oust Saddam Hussein.  Not only that, but also about the folks who tried to stop the battle before it started, and about the Iraqis who welcomed the US&allies as their liberators.  It still doesn't tell you which side I agree with.

<p>Jimbeaux,

<p>Why do you think they have no political agenda?  It's fairly clear that those fighting the coalition in Iraq have multiple agendas.  Some want to restablish a Sunni government, others to create a Shia dominated Islamic Republic, others to engage the U.S. in battle, some for martyrdom, and some out of a sense that their territory has been occupied.  If anything, it's a surfeit of motives, which is part of the problem we are having defeating them.

<p>So, assuming the insurgents are not spending much time reading internet posts and would be fighting us no matter what morons like Mike Moore have to say, isn't it important for us to figure out why they are fighting?  It is especially dangerous to just throw up our hands and say they're inscrutable; failure to understand the enemy always leads to defeat.  If we can't "really know what these people want," then we will have that much more trouble winning.

<p>So you and I agree, Aubrey.  Opinions have effects and people should be held accountable for them.  But that doesn't mean people who support the war as currently conducted are exempt from such responsibility.  If the current strategy is mistaken and will, in the long run, harm American interests, then supporting that strategy is wrong, and the person doing so is undermining American interests.

<p>The point, simply, is that you are trying to reach a conclusion (people who doubt the current strategy should shut up or they cannot "be considered innocent if the effect seems determined to be in opposition to our aims") that cannot be attained from your premise, unless you add the further premise that the way the war is being fought right now is the best way to fight it.  If it isn't (and there is substantial disagreement about this even among moderate Republicans like myself) then shutting up doesn't follow.  In fact, you have an obligation to voice such concern, and if you don't, you are acting "in opposition to our aims."

<p>The same goes for people whose motives are perhaps objectively anti-American, since, as you say, motivation doesn't matter.  If they are telling us something useful that will help us understand the enemy and defeat them, I want to hear it.

<p>So Aubrey, what you are saying is that

<p>1) The only proper American thing to do once a war is started is to support it and the President

<p>which follows:

<p>2) A President who starts a war will be fully supported

<p>which follows:

<p>3) If you want to be re-elected, just start a war

<p>and

<p>4) If any aggressive country (see any war where there's a bad guy) follows your advice, there will be no way democracy can be used to stop any war.

<p>and that leads to

<p>5) The end of the concept that democracies are peaceful with each other or anyone else for that matter.

<p>Yay, warmongering.
