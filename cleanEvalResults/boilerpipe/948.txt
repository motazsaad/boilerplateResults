<h>E.J. Dionne writes in the Washington Post today, " First Step? Admit There's a Problem ."  He writes:

<p>History repeats itself in strange ways. Consider two statements.

<p>"A slogan like 'stay the course' is unacceptable."

<p>And: "Stay the course is not a policy."

<p>The first quotation goes back to October 1982, when a Republican candidate for governor of New York named Lewis Lehrman complained about his party's national slogan during that year's midterm elections. Stay the course, insisted Lehrman, who eventually lost narrowly to Democrat Mario Cuomo, was a lousy theme in the face of a 10 percent national unemployment rate.

<p>The second quotation is of more recent, though still Republican, coinage. Last Sunday, Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska laid into the Bush administration's policy in Iraq. Hagel insisted that remaining in Iraq over an extended period -- staying the course -- "would bog us down, it would further destabilize the Middle East, it would give Iran more influence."

<p>The problem with Dionne's argument, of course, is that with respect to 1982, history has shown Reagan was right and Lehrman was wrong on the wisdom of the "stay the course" strategy, as the short-term pain of the severe 1982 recession created the economic conditions for a long-term boom.  At the very least, Dionne seems to be mixing apples and oranges--Lehrman seems to be criticizing Reagan's rhetoric (the "slogan" of "stay the course") more than the policy, whereas Hagel is criticizing the substantive policy decision.

<p>This is not to say anything about whether "Stay the course" is the right or wrong policy in Iraq, it is simply to say that the substance of the Lehrman example seems to support exactly the opposite of the point Dionne intends.

<p>E.J. Dionne's a smart man who always seems to miss the point anyway.  For a better critique of the "Stay the course" rhetoric, read Jonah Goldberg's piece on NRO today .  Excerpt:

<p>There is an important lesson for President Bush in all this. The message of his recent speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars was that we need to “stay the course.” That has been his talking point for a very long time. And, in fairness, if your policy is to stay the course, then saying “stay the course” has a certain irrefutable logic to it. But on any long journey, even if the course remains the same the terrain may change.

<p>Nobody needs to stay the course when everything's going perfectly - some hardship is implied in the message, also the need to continue, knowing the overall stratgy is still correct.

<p>"Stay the course" is rhetoric.  It tends to be effective for a while.  Because failing to stay the course looks weak and vacillating.  It was therefore ultimately effective for Reagan, because the economy turned around dramatically.  However, after a time "stay the course" in the face of frustration looks not so much strong as stubborn.  I suspect it is not a good long term trope for Bush, because I suspect that Iraq will not turn around so obviously and dramatically as did the Reagan economy.

<p>As policy, I doubt "stay the course" has much pull.  The Administration is not staying the course because it's devoted to staying the course for its own sake.  It began with the goal to remake Iraq and it still has that goal, so it's staying the course for external reasons.

<p>I too doubt that stay the course has much pull after a while, with the people in America. But if you ask Iraqis, I would be they are glad we aren't going to change course on them. If we did it would be a disaster.

<p>I am always struck by the Vietnam anti-war protest folks and how they want to overlook the fact that failing to stay the course had disastrous consequences for the people on the ground. The left always tries to prevent you from thinking about those consequences with their catchy slogans and lingo. The millions of dead SE Asians speaks loudly of the consequences of NOT staying the course.

<p>Expediency at home does not necessarily translate to Iraq proper, nor the catchy slogans of the leftists. Great care should be exercised when trying to make that leap of faith. Make the wrong move now, and millions of Iraqis may end up as fodder for the Isloamo-Fascists.

<p>It's pretty much a case of 'necessary but not sufficient'. If you have a policy and you don't 'stay the course' then you don't have a policy. But what policy you do have matters too; left-wing Democrats are doing a fine job of staying their course, for instance, but it can't be said they're profiting much.

<p>Looks like we are fighting a GSAVE and they are fighting a war.  We use police or SWAT tactics and legal hearings (in Iraq now, apparently, per Michael Yon).  They fight total war plus illegal war.

<p>I see conceptual asymmetry in their favor.  How long before we have reporters like Yon (http://michaelyon.blogspot.com/) embedded with Iraqi units reporting heroic action by our Iraqis against insurgent Iraqis?   If not in the next 6-12 months, are we backing a winner (comparable to the mujahedeen-types we backed against the Soviets in Afganistan)?  Hopefully we are not backing the sort of weak, uncommitted, in-it-for-the-money client we backed in Vietnam.

<p>It still appears from writings by reporters with US troops in Iraq (Michael Yon comes to mind) that we cannot trust the Iraqis not to leak US operation plans to insurgents.  Any idea when that might change?

<p>Bush needs to have some folks in his group that will sort out the facts and tell him if this police action will be better in end result than our efforts to support South Vietnam in its unsuccessful efforts against the Viet Cong and NVN.  Then, it might be nice to get a bit more than slogans for public consumption.

<p>Might want to also look at how much of the restrictions on US troop actions arise from the law of war versus rules of engagement concerns.  Might ask why should our rules of engagement be asymmetrical with rules of engagement of the foe (so long as we are within the law of war).  That did not happen in the US Civil War or WWII.  Here, insurgents get to fight without rules of engagement, giving them a leg up.  Are the restrictions similar to what we imposed in Vietnam, and will they tend to give us the same end result as in VN?  If we are not prepared now to fight to the limits of what the law of war allows, doing everything legal to win, are we being fair to our troops?

<p>I supported the war from the start, and still do, but reports from the front (via Michael Yon) that are supposed to be encouraging (per Instapundit) look troubling to me.
