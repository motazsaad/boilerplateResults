 If there has been no charter proposed for a MMMS working group, I intend to propose one as follows. I would like to know how the Area Directors feel about the following ideas, many of which are informed by the comments of Patrik, Ned, and others in the Apps Discussion archives --   http://wilma.cs.utk.edu/mail-archive/discuss.1999-12   Proposed MMMS working group purpose: The MMMS working group will produce a series of Internet-Drafts, and attempt to produce RFCs, describing the use of end-to-end Internet multimedia messaging and related services on mobile devices. The specifications will concern application-level services as well as general end-to-end Internet service specifications and lower-level services such as non-wireless serial PPP access from mobile devices. No new protocols will be created; only existing open Internet standards and protocols free from any intellectual property encumbrance will be incorporated into MMMS specifications, along with specific implementation interoperability guidelines. Proposed special document status and process for MMMS specifications: Recognizing that it may be impossible to achieve consensus on topics in which large and diverse corporate concerns have vested interests opposed to open standards, the MMMS working group will have a special goal to produce Internet-Drafts which will identified as &quot;Frozen MMMS RFC-track Internet-Drafts.&quot; These documents might never become RFCs because of an expected lack of consensus, but upon identification as such by the Working Group, they will be announced and archived as frozen documents. Developers may rely on such documents as static and vendors and customers will be encouraged to refer to them in their procurement process. The level of consensus required to designate Frozen MMMS RFC-track Internet-Drafts will be a simple majority of those working group participants who are not affiliated with organizations having direct or indirect financial interests in closed-protocol mobile services. Any member of the working group not affiliated with organizations having direct or indirect financial interests in closed-protocol mobile services may call a vote on the designation of any Internet-Draft as a Frozen MMMS RFC-track Internet-Draft, and if after one week's time there are more such MMMS WG participants in favor than dissenting, the WG Chair, the author of the draft, or the participant calling the vote will then take steps to establish a permanent archive of the draft and publish an announcement of its availability to the IETF community. Anyone affiliated with organizations having direct or indirect financial interests in closed-protocol mobile services may not call a vote or vote on such special designation, but all participants will have normal consensus rights in the traditional RFC process, and all Internet-Drafts must follow the existing IESG intellectual property disclosure process. Proposed milestones: The goals of the MMMS WG will include the publication of specifications, as described above, on the following topics: interoperable end-to-end Internet service access on mobile devices, including descriptions of existing end-to-end wireless Internet service arrangements; implementation guidelines for multimedia messaging services on mobile devices using existing Internet messaging standards; guidelines concerning performance implications of link constraints, including TCP behaviors during extended periods of wireless link downtime; and wired PPP access from mobile Internet devices. Jim Mathis: Would you be interested in chairing a MMMS working group charted as described above? Would your organization's current apparent commitment to closed-protocol mobile messaging solutions make you an inappropriate chair for such a group? If you would not want to, or do not feel you would be an appropriate chair, I would volunteer to serve as an interim chair. Cheers, James &gt; At the November meeting, about 90 people attended the Mobile &gt; Multimedia Messaging Service BOF: &gt; &gt;   http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/99nov/46th-99nov-ietf-42.html   &gt; &gt; But the mailing list has been dead: &gt; &gt;   http://www.imc.org/ietf-mmms/mail-archive/threads.html   &gt; &gt; MMMS-related topics seem to be fairly prevalent on the general &gt; IETF discussion list, with a lot of general agreement that the &gt; status quo has some real problems. &gt; &gt; Has anyone started on a working group charter? &gt; &gt; There needs to be an organized effort to provide explicit and &gt; well-documented alternatives to the closed-protocol, &gt; pseudo-internet mobile access consortia, who are a real barrier &gt; to easy and reasonable mobile multimedia messaging services. &gt; I for one would certainly contribute a great deal of time and &gt; effort to the success of such a working group.
