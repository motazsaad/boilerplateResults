<p>Glass (b. 1937), along with Steve Reich, La&nbsp;Monte Young, and Terry Riley, helped shape the minimalist movement. His highly recognizable style has won Glass wide critical and commercial acceptance. Glass's music is marked by its repetitions and bright keyboard figures, and he has made important inroads into scoring music for films and unconventional operas. Here are his essential recordings.

 Although   Einstein on the Beach   is by definition an opera, Philip Glass's most famous work also transcends traditional music categories. Glass avoided all vestiges of plot in the piece and dug deep into his quiver of repetitions to create an artfully unnerving five hours of brilliance. The instrumental ensemble never exceeds five members, playing electric keyboards, saxophones, flutes, and a single violin. Furthermore, the music congregates around the upper registers, often darting through its...  Read more

 Fifteen years after its initial release, Philip Glass's score to Godfrey Reggio's film   Koyaanisqatsi   is still as timeless as it was meant to be. Glass's epic score, virtually the only sound in this non-narrative movie, accompanied an exhilarating, wordless meditation of images ranging from expansive, slow-motion landscapes to whirling-dervish city scenes shot using time-lapse techniques. Glass's music was a perfect match. The opening chant is still unlike anything Glass has composed, a Tibetan...  Read more

 This is an extraordinary retelling of the classic story &quot;The Beauty and the Beast&quot;, this time based on the Jean Cocteau film   La Belle et la Bete  . Philip Glass, one of our reigning minimalists, studied under Darius Milhaud and Nadia Boulanger in Paris and his music has always had a quiet Debussy-like character to it. What is amazing is that Glass is one of the minimalists who have made a successful transition into opera (John Adams is the other). And catch the scary silent-movie-house...  Read more 

<p>  Glass: Music With Changing Parts / Philip Glass Ensemble

 Philip Glass's early works have purely functional titles, and this one is no exception. His masterpiece in this repetitious and rigorously structural composition style--   Music in Twelve Parts  --may be just too much for some people to take. If so, then this disc may be just the ticket. Of course, Glass's many fans will snap it up as a matter of course, but as the title implies, there's somewhat more happening here than in his very first minimalist works--just enough so that newcomers to the style...

<p>   Glassworks   remains Philip Glass's bestseller from the middle period of his career, the recording by means of which many listeners familiarized themselves with his music. Conceived as a thematically whole instrumental studio album taking advantage of the promotional and marketing capabilities of what was then Glass's new major label (CBS, now Sony Classical) and targeted at consumers intrigued with his newfound notoriety,   Glassworks   features six parts (three per side on the original LP and...
