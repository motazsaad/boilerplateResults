  Observant little ...  

<p>I don't understand the answer, but I may have some ideas on the question... 

<p>About Me 

<p>   Name:  OLS  

<p>   Location:  Brisbane, Queensland, Australia  

<p> My family refer to me as the "observant little s**t" after a couple of things I mentioned about them or others that hit a little too close to home. One was my cousin's lip curl whenever she said the word "teacher". Another was that my mother thought she never pushed us kids... in fact, her ethos was more like "Thou shall succeed... if you really want to!"
