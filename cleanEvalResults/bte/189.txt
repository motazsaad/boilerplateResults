<p>  
 In Somalia, jihadists, with the support of al Qaeda, have clashed with troops loyal to the country's internationally recognized interim government and now threaten neighboring Ethiopia with all-out war.

   Policy Review 

<p>  A review of   Fiasco: The American Adventure in Iraq   by Thomas E. Ricks (Penguin Press, 2006, pp. 496) 

<p>   T  homas Ricks, the distinguished Pulitzer-prize-winning former Wall Street Journal and current Washington Post&nbsp;journalist, has published widely on defense issues, winning the respect of many, both inside the Pentagon and while on deployment abroad, for his disinterested narratives.

<p>  Lest We Forget 

<p>  Editor's Note:  

<p>  Two-and-a-half years ago, in May 2004, VDH warned that all the squabbling over Iraq could be put to rest should the United States take the initiative and defeat the insurrectionists, the premise being that most have no ideology, but most certainly do not want to be associated with a losing enterprise. Then he was worried that the withdrawal from the first attack of Fallujah and the escape of Sadr sent a terrible message that the United States was not winning, and that such magnanimity would be unfortunately considered weakness, leading only to more violence.

   Our Reptilian Brains 

<p> When &ldquo;Just Win, Baby&rdquo; sadly trumps everything else. 
   by Victor Davis Hanson 
   National Review Online 

<p>  After our victory in Afghanistan, the president's approval ratings soared, only to descend during the acrimony leading up to the March invasion of Iraq. But after the three-week war, somewhere between 60 and 70 percent of these same Americans purportedly returned to their earlier support of the president's initiatives.

<p>   P  resident Bush and his neoconservative advisers, along with his compliant top brass, are pilloried as hegemonists and imperialists, spending vast amounts of blood and treasure in a vain effort to ram our brand of democracy down the collective throat of the Muslim Middle East.

 The pundits and politicians on the East Coast have really lost it, declaring the war in Iraq now over and lost&#151;even as 140,000 American soldiers are not only still in the field, but fighting in the belief that they can and will win, and that such a victory leading to a stable government in Iraq will enrich millions in the region and make us safer at home.

<p>  Selective Morality 

<p>When George Bush Sr. addressed an audience in Abu Dhabi, he was jeered and blamed for globalization &#151; this from a country that can only exist with foreign expertise in a globalized world that finds, extracts, and sells its accidental petroleum fortune. What exactly have the subjects of the Gulf monarchies achieved without foreign expertise &#151; or the armed forces of the United States that alone guarantee free and safe world commerce in and out of the Persian Gulf?

   They're Back? 

<p>  All too real 

<p>I have been going through the recent report, &ldquo;Iran: Time for a New Approach&rdquo; co-chaired by Zbigniew Brzezinski (in charge at National Security during the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979) and Robert Gates (involved in Iran-Contra). It makes depressing reading in its call for new talks with the dictators in Iran, since we have done that for 20 years, and should have learned that they lip-synch back only when they feel they have more to gain than lose. Churchill understood that when he put an end to Tory backchannel efforts to talk with ascendant Nazis after the fall of France. And surely we should learn something from the recent Hamas step back and apparent willingness to rethink talking to Israel &#151; given its loss of millions in Western handouts and tough Israel retaliation against Gaza.

<p>  Mr. Hanson, have you ever written anything positive about Muslims or Islam, or is it always going to be Israel and the U.S. right, Islam always wrong? 

<p>Hanson: How odd to suggest that when the now demonized policy, which I supported, of staying on after the removal of Saddam Hussein to allow elections for the Iraqis was most certainly based on the utopian idea that Muslims themselves were quite capable of consensual government as we see in Turkey or Indonesia. 

<p>So it is up to Arab Muslims to prove that ideal was also true of the Arab Middle East, and show that Palestine and Iraq can stabilize and conduct democracy under the rule of law. 

<p>Another piece of advise to you, as a moderate Muslim in the West: the present U.S. policy was about as good as the Middle East was going to get, this engagement that saw billions spent in Afghanistan and Iraq for democracy, and real American pressure exerted on behalf on the people of Lebanon, Egypt, and the Gulf States to have a say in their governments. 

<p>So we are at a great crossroads: when the world's only superpower puts its money and lives behind the idea of consensual government for Arab Muslims, will they tweak and fidget about the infidel's hubris, or use the opening for their own purposes of reform? 

<p>
