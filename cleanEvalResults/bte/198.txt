 Got 2.3 MW, only a few minor trips. This time we had a series of more ELM-free H-modes, with   accumulating impurities and radiation. Not a pretty sight. H/D is up to 0.18!  Next shot, lower Ip to 0.9 MW in an attempt to get EDA conditions.

<p>  Physics Run plan for 1010719, MP 287 Asdex H-mode similarity experiment  Goal: To make high density, high power EDA H-modes in a shape identical to  that in ASDEX-Upgrade 'Type II ELM' discharges. This regime,  which was only recently obtained on AUG, appears rather similar to that  obtained on C-Mod when power is increased into EDA H-modes. At reduced powers,  AUG sometimes sees a 'quasi-coherent' mode. We would like to see if the same  behaviour is observed on the two machines with the same dimensionless  parameters. We will obtain edge profiles both at threshold and in the steady  H-mode period. AUG will then try to match the  dimensionless parameters (nu*,beta, rho*) of these discharges.  Plan:  1) Obtain suitable shape, plasma parameters. Start with shape from shot  1010605016. Raise Ip to 1.0 MA, keep Bt at 5.3 T. L-mode nel=1.1e20 m-2.   Once plasma is obtained, adjust shape to get a better match to AUG pulse 14265.  This will involve increasing the inner gap and the radius of the x-point.  RF should use these shots (3-4?) to tune and condition;  For the last shot we would like a power ramp up to >~2 MW to get the  threshold power, and both L and H-mode tunes.  2) High power EDAs. Use square wave RF pulse at Ptot=2.5 MW using D and E at  80 MHz (more if we can get it). Measure pedestals, and fluctuations.  Tune J-port at low power on these.  3) Add power from J-port (70 MHz), at maximum available power. This will be  off-axis, which is non-optimal, but should help to raise pedestal temperature.   4) Increase density. A dimensionless match to the best AUG 'grassy ELM' shots  would correspond to a line integrated density of 4.7e20, higher than our usual  range. Increase starting density, and probably puff gas into EDA, to see how  high we can get and still maintain a decent, steady H-mode (and couple enough  power). ECE will probably be cut off, so good ETS data are essential.  Again, use max available power without and with J-port.  4) Once the 'high density' H-mode has been characterized, use a slow power  ramp to determine the corresponding threshold power and edge parameters.

Results:  We had limited success with this run, primarily due to poor machine conditions.  This was probably a result of the recent vent, combined with the fact that we  were running non-standard shapes, and thus putting power on different vessel  surfaces. This led to impurity injections and, most critically, to a high  hydrogen fraction (up to 20%) which limited the RF power absorption; H/D  typically increases during each discharge, with Pabs decreasing.  The shape development part of the run went quite smoothly, and we  did get shots which were a very close match to ASDEX Upgrade shapes (see  physics operator summary for details of changes made). These had elongation  close to our vertical stability limits (k~1.73), and were close to double null,  which may have caused some interaction with upper vessel surfaces, and possibly   also increased H-mode thresholds. The last AUG shaped shot, 1010719020, is a  good example (Delta_u=0.34, delta_l= 0.47)  J-port was not available for the run after all, so we ran with typically 2.3  MW at 80 MHz from D and E port antennas. However, the low absorption means  that the effective power was actually much lower, especially late in the pulse.  We were unable to get any H-modes which had a steady, EDA character. Many were  ELM-free, with strongly increasing impurities. (eg. shot 2, 14). Others, with  lower power and higher radiation, had periodic behaviour typical of Type III  ELMs; the pedestal was very cold (eg. shots 5,13). On shots 9 and 11 we ramped  the RF up slowly to get threshold data, and found it was over the 2.3 MW  injected); this is very high for these C-Mod conditions. Making the discharge  more 'single null' had little effect (shot 12). Lowering the target density  from nel= 0.9 to 0.7e20 m-2, while it had minimal effect on nebar at the RF  onset (1.35-1.4e20m-3 in both cases), resulted in much lower neutral pressure  anda threshold of Prf=1.13 MW (shot 13). This may be a good point for threshold  comparison, though it was rather early in the ramp. Shot 14 had full RF power  at this density, and resulted in ELM-free H-modes.  In an attempts to favour the EDA regime, Ip was lowered from 1.0 to 0.9 MA from  shot 15 on. This raised q95 to 4.2. The rates of density rise did decrease  slightly, though not an obvious EDA regime. Shot 16 had hints of a weak  quasi-coherent  mode on PCI. Shot 17 was colder and more ELMy. From shot 19 Bt was raised  from 5.3 T to 5.6 T, raising q95 still further and a better match to the AUG  target. This proved more difficult for the RF to match, for reasons not well  understood at least by me, and power was not as steady as the rest of the day.  The density did appear to be getting more steady, and QC modes characteristic  of EDA were seen on PCI. Shot 21, about 0.75-0.8 secs, may be a good time for  pedestal analysis. For shot 22, we went back to a standard shape, 800 kA shot  to check we could get EDA there. We did, but it quickly cooled and reverted to  Type III ELMs as H/D rose.  In summary, as expected, it was more difficult to get steady H-modes in the  lower triangularity ASDEX-Upgrade shape. However, the poor machine conditions  and low absorbed power undoubtedly were a major impediment, and there were  indications we were getting close. There was insufficient power to try raising  the density. Since the discharge development has been successfully completed,  we would very much like to revisit this experiment on a day with better vessel  conditions and all three RF antennas available.

Better; makes it to 1.47 secs. Three H-modes, and the third is quite steady.  However, H/D at this point is 20%, radiation is high and net power therefore  presumably very low.  Pedestal Te ~ 200 eV; may be in an intermittent ELMy/EDA regime.  For next shot, try to increase RF power. Asked Stu Zweben to delay D2 puffing  to 1.4 secs.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------   1010719006 hubbard SESSION_LEADER Jul 19 2001 10:36:52:666AM  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  Disrupted 0.82 seconds. Two H-modes, not EDA. Both end due to rapid increase  of Prad.  H/D still very high, though core heating seems OK in this early period.

VERY similar to shot 11.  Made it to 1.4 seconds. RF ramps 1.0 to 2.3 MW, as requested. Plasma STILL  stays in L-mode. Why??  Try backing off on density, replace ~200 kW of D-port power by E-port in case  it is contributing to the  injection.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------   1010719013 hubbard SESSION_LEADER Jul 19 2001 1:09:58:650PM  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  Lowering density got us into H-mode, at 0.665 secs, 1.13 MW. H-mode was very  ELMy; low pedestal  temperatures. RF ramped up slowly as requested, H/D ramped up to 0.2 (as NOT  requested).  Next shot try full RF power right away.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------   1010719014 hubbard SESSION_LEADER Jul 19 2001 1:21:51:980PM  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  Got 2.3 MW, only a few minor trips. This time we had a series of more ELM-free  H-modes, with  accumulating impurities and radiation. Not a pretty sight. H/D is up to 0.18!

Reducing Ip to 900 kA increased q95 to ~4.2. Got a somewhat longer, steadier  H-mode;  not quite EDA I think.

Steady RF on this one, 2.2 MW. For some reason H-modes are shorter, accumulate  more ne and  impurities. Next shot, increase nel ~ 10%.  Nel was 0.75-1.84x10^20 m-2 on this one.  Appears to be a weak quasicoherent mode partway through these H-modes (as seen  on PCI).  Frequency is lower than usual.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------   1010719017 hubbard SESSION_LEADER Jul 19 2001 2:38:33:220PM  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  At slightly higher nel 0.87-1.9x10^20 m-2, got into a series of ELMy periods.  Temperatures, edge and  core, drop dramatically through RF pulse, presumably due to high H/D.  For the next shot, raise Bt to 5.6 T, as in the original run plan, thus raising  q95.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------   1010719019 hubbard SESSION_LEADER Jul 19 2001 3:09:55:533PM  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Still a lot of RF trips. Two H-modes. The first has a steadier density,  though conditions never get  quite stationary. Period 0.75-0.8 secs is fairly steady, may be good to look  at pedestal parameters.  QC mode appears during this window too (on PCI)  nel1.6e20 m-2, nebar=2.8e20 m-3, TE,ped 340 ev(Thomson) (also Te7, ECE), te_95  =400 eV,  ne_95 1.8e20.  All profiles, parameters need checking!  For next shot, load a standard C-Mod shape from 1010716004, 780 kA, 5.36 T, to  see if we get back  a good EDA.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------   1010719022 hubbard SESSION_LEADER Jul 19 2001 4:10:21:470PM  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  reload of 1010716004 (780 kA, standard shape) does give EDA, at least to ~0.8  seconds. Edge and core  temps then decrease, presumably due to H/D increase (8-12 %), and discharge  gets ELMy.  PCI sees 'classic QC mode'  ~1.9 MW RF, better loading.  -

<p>  Physop Summary for 19 Jul 2001  MP 287 AUG Similarity.  PO Hutch  SL Hubbard.  Summary  _______  Shapes that are an excellent match to the scaled AUG shape were  obtained (e.g. 21) and many were run. A comparison plot is in   user10:[hutch.ps]aug_match.ps. They are close to double null;  although a range of three sseps was run without obvious effect on the  plasma character. No solid EDA H-modes were obtained. The H/D was high  and rose strongly with RF in the early part of the day. Later on, the  rises seemed less significant, but in all cases the H/D was above 10%  during much of the RF pulse. Heating was clearly inefficient in many  cases. In some others heating was ok even at high H/D.  The early part of the day was plagued with injections. Many appeared  to be caused by visible sparks on the upper left corner of D-antenna.  Some others were not RF induced. As the day wore on, these problems   were less severe, and the plasma ran reasonably reliably.  These shapes are fairly close to stability limits. One or two VDEs were  experienced. The chopper V was set to 150 to 200 instead of the usual 0  to lower the operating average current to a position closer to the center  of its range. This adjustment seemed to be a significant improvement in   that it allowed operation with an elongation that gave rise to noisy chopper  behaviour without leading to saturations and subsequent VDE.  A manual gas puff during the RF did not significantly improve the   operation, but also did not seem to give much impact on the RF coupling  despite a x2 rise in main chamber neutral pressure.  It appears to be confirmed that the lower triangularity that is needed to  match AUG makes it harder to get into EDA. The high H level was also   definitely a handicap.
