<p>Reports Available through Faculty Roster  

<p> U.S. Medical School Faculty 

<p>The annual report   U.S. Medical School Faculty   is a set of 20 tables that answer common questions about the national distribution of full-time faculty. The information is displayed by specialty, department, rank, degree, sex, and race/hispanic origin. (Data on part-time faculty, volunteer, and emeritus faculty are excluded.) 

<p>From 1986-1997, printed copies of   U.S. Medical School Faculty   were distributed to medical school deans, Faculty Roster representatives, and other selected constituents. The report is now published online only and is produced using a database snapshot from December 31. Prior to December 31, 1997, the publication was based on a June 30 database snapshot. 

<p>Note that the AAMC Faculty Roster does not necessarily reflect official faculty counts. As a result, the figures in these tables should be viewed and used with care. While the proportion of faculty across key variables may be reasonably accurate, the number of faculty may not be. For the official faculty figures, please visit the Medical School Profile System at http://services.aamc.org/mspsreports. Although the Medical School Profile System reflects official faculty counts that institutions provide as part of their accreditation process, the Medical School Profile System does not always provide the kind of detail that the Faculty Roster provides.

<p>Faculty Roster Benchmark Reports 

<p>The   Faculty Roster Benchmark Reports   application is an interactive reporting tool utilizing Faculty Roster data. Users have the ability to generate reports in a variety of ways. For example, users can generate one of the Template Reports and tweak it to view the data according to their own criteria, including creating comparison groups of institutions. Users can also create their own Custom Reports, choosing from a large number of permutations of Faculty Roster fields.  

<p>Special Reports 

<p>Faculty Roster staff are able to conduct special reports for individuals whose needs are not met from existing reports. Special reports may vary from simple analyses requiring minimal programming to complicated analyses requiring significant time and effort. The charge for a special report depends on the length of time to complete the analysis, with three hours as the typical length of time.
