<p>  I found Anne Collins through my doctor! We had a long discussion one day about my weight and how many diets I had tried etc. He told me to go on-line and find Anne&quot;s site. He was doing research at the time on on-line diets (e-diets etc) and said that Anne's was the only one that was always nutritionally sound and would make sure the weight would come off and stay off! The best advice I was ever given!!

<p> ...my doctor called me personally at work to tell me that I won't have to take cholesterol meds. My LDL was 164. It is now 104! I really feel like my body is ready to let go of the fat and maybe it won't be so hard from now on. Thanks Anne for not letting me give up!

<p>  What Members Say About the Forum 

<p>  &quot;I have literally dieted 38 of my 48 years and I have learned more in the six weeks since I joined this group than ever before. Oh, I knew all there was to know about calories, fat grams, carbs, etc. I could write my own book. What I have learned....actually, what I am learning is about self-image, positive attitude, etc. I knew all the physical stuff but here I am learning about the mental part of weight loss. I am finding out that is an essential part of any weight loss program.&quot; 

<p> GR 

<p>  
 &quot;Boy, I love this forum. You can't get this kind of treatment anywhere else, and believe me I have tried WW, Curves, Jenny Craig, everything. Nothing beats Anne. I want to eventually get to 150 lbs. I will be happpy if I just break the terrible 200 lb mark. I haven't seen that in almost 18 years when I had my last child.&quot; 

<p> DD

<p> I used shame to motivate myself to reduce weight. That's why I check out your weight loss motivation tips at least once a day. They are not &quot;shame-based&quot;! They are great touchstones to make me think that I really can lose this weight and feel good about myself through the whole dieting process...

<p>  I have lost 60 pounds as of today. I`m on thyroid medicine, I was on prednisone which made me gain weight, but on this diet [cholesterol lowering diet] I started losing even though I was on both medications. I`m on the GI diet now. I love the food on it.

<p>  Hi Anne 

<p> what REALLY impresses me is your customer service. It is simply amazing compared to anything else I've experienced...

<p> Joining your weight loss program was the best $20 we ever spent, I have lost 50 pounds and my wife has lost 100 pounds! My wife has even been asked a couple of times if she has had gastric bypass. We are quick to tell them, just order your program, follow it, and exercise. I have attached before/after pics of my wife.

<p>  Hi Anne 

<p> I just wanted to thank you for your wonderful web site. I recently completed a 10 week diet sponsored by my work place. With the help of your low carb diet I was able to lose 24 pounds over the 10 week period.... Once again, thanks, I have never felt so wonderful and I think your customer service is awesome.

<p>  Hi Anne 

<p> When I joined your weight loss plan nine months ago, I was confused and bitter about lots of different things in my life - especially my weight. I won't list all these things - the list would be too long!! - but I can say that with your help I can now see some light at the end of the tunnel. Your motivation advice especially has been a huge help. Anyway, I am now 60 pounds lighter... you don't know what a difference you have made to me. Bless You!

<p> I had a cholesterol screening yesterday at Fred Meyer pharmacy. Blood is from a finger poke vs. a blood draw but the technician said accuracy is within a few points. Since starting the cholesterol lowering diet 11 weeks ago: total cholesterol, down 39 points to 197; triglicerides, down 28; HDL (good cholesterol), about the same; LDL (bad cholesterol), down 29 points with a total cholesterol/HDL ratio of 3.8 instead of 4.14. I'm delighted with my progress...

<p> I would like to thank you for your motivational tips and diet solutions! I am a 28yr old male hispanic, 5ft 4in. In two months, my weight and body stats have changed from 139 pounds, 20 percent body fat, 34 inch waist - to 125 pounds, 13 percent body fat, and 31 inch waist. My activity level has remained constant: lightly active (1-2 hours at the gym a week weightlifting, light running)...

<p> Well, this is my fourth week on the low glycemic diet and I lost 4 pounds this week. That's a total of 12 pounds and I actually feel better. I went to the doctor last week and she reduced my insulin dosages, which is terrific.  ..

<p>  Anne 

<p> Just a quick update for you. As of today, July 22, I am down 90 pounds to 180. I have not been this lean since I was 18 years old. I will be 51 in 9 days!

<p> I am about 5 foot 9, and was weighing 182 pounds. My doctor had just told me that the constant pain in my low back was arthritis and that losing weight would be important to minimizing the effects of the disease over time. Last Friday... he was stunned to look at my chart and see that I now weigh 150 pounds! He applauded my effort. Thank you for your diet. 
   Sheila (Illinois) 

<p>  

<p>  Anne, ... my doctor told me yesterday that he didn`t think I needed my zestril [high blood pressure med] He has lowered my thyroid med to about half of what it was. And I`ve been off prednisone now since Aug. ALL THANKS TO YOU. Thanks so much Anne for all you`ve done..
