<p>The Muppets are a family of puppet/  marionette   characters created by   Jim Henson   in the 1950's. The first, and most, famous Muppet is "  Kermit the Frog  ", created in 1955 for a daily two-minute puppet show called, "Sam and Friends." Kermit had feet instead of flippers and no collar, becoming "Kermit the Frog" later, in a show called "Hey Cinderella." In 1969, the Children's Television Workshop began televising   Sesame Street  , starring Muppet characters, "  Bert" and "Ernie"  , "  Oscar the Grouch  ", "  Cookie Monster  ", "  Grover  ", and "  Big Bird  ." 

<p>The Muppets got their own television series, a variety show hosted by "Kermit", in 1976. It ran for five years and reached audiences in more than 100 countries. Among the characters created for the show were "  Miss Piggy  ", "  Fozzie the Bear  ," "  Gonzo  ," "  Dr. Bunsen Honeydew  ," "Beaker," and "  The Swedish Chef  ". The Muppets also "starred" in a string of films, including,   The Muppet Movie  ,   The Muppets Take Manhattan  , and   The Great Muppet Caper  .  

<p>There were two other Muppet TV series, one called,   Fraggle Rock  , and the other,   The Storyteller  .

<p>  the Muppets 

<p>  The Muppets   are a group of puppets and costume characters, and the company created by   Jim Henson  . Individually, a Muppet is properly one of the puppets made by   Jim Henson   or his   Creature Shop   – though the term is often used erroneously to refer to any puppet that resembles the distinctive style of   The Muppet Show   and   Sesame Street   characters, the term is both an informal name and legal   trademark   linked to the characters created by   The Jim Henson Company  . After frequently changing hands since the death of creator Jim Henson in 1990, The Muppets have been owned by   The Walt Disney Company  , through the   Muppets Holding Company  , since early 2004. 

<p>The word "Muppet" itself was said by Henson to have been created by combining the words "  marionette  " and "puppet"; however, Henson was also known to have stated that it was just something he liked the sound of, and he made up the "marionette/puppet" story while talking to a journalist because it sounded plausible.   [1] 

<p>Muppets are distinguished from   ventriloquist   "dummies", which are typically animated only in the head and face, in that their arms or other features are also mobile and expressive. Muppets are typically made of softer materials. They are also presented as being independent of the puppeteer, who is usually not visible, hidden behind a set or outside of the camera frame. 

<p>Appearance 

<p>The most common design for a Jim Henson Muppet is a character with a very wide mouth and large protruding eyes. The puppets are often molded or carved out of   foam rubber  , and then covered with fleece. Yarn, nylon string, or (most commonly) ostrich feathers are used to create hair. As there is no "eye store" from which they can be purchased, Muppet eyes are often made (as in the case of the original Kermit) from   ping-pong   balls, from fishing floats, or from a hemispherical toy called a Wacky Stax. Muppets may represent humans,   anthropomorphic   animals, realistic animals, robots or anthropomorphic objects, extra-terrestrial creatures, mythical beings or other unidentified, newly imagined creatures. 

<p>Operation 

<p>The puppeteer typically holds the puppet above his head or in front of his body, with one hand operating the head and mouth and the other manipulating the hands and arms, either with two separate control rods or by "wearing" the hands like gloves. One consequence of this design is that most Muppets are left handed as the puppeteer uses his right hand to operate the head while operating the arm rod with his left hand. There are many other common designs and means of operation. In advanced puppets, several puppeteers may control a single character; the performer who controls the mouth usually provides the voice for the character. As technology has evolved, the Jim Henson team and other puppeteers have developed an enormous variety of means to operate puppets for film and television, including the use of suspended rigs, internal motors, remote radio control, and computer enhanced and superimposed images. Creative use of a mix of technologies has allowed for scenes in which Muppets appear to be riding a bicycle, rowing a boat, and even dancing onstage with no puppeteer in sight. 

<p>Famous Muppets 

<p> The Muppets in   Weezer  's 'Keep Fishin'" 

<p>Famous Muppets include   Kermit the Frog  ,   Miss Piggy  ,   Fozzie Bear  ,   Gonzo  ,   Big Bird  ,   Bert and Ernie  ,   Elmo  , and   Oscar the Grouch  . The most widely known television shows featuring Muppets are   Sesame Street  ,   Fraggle Rock  , and   The Muppet Show  . A recurring adult-oriented cast of Muppets (in a setting known as the “Land of Gortch”) were part of the first season of   Saturday Night Live  . Other, less popular series have included   The Jim Henson Hour   and   Muppets Tonight  . The puppet characters of   Farscape  ,   The Storyteller  ,   The Hoobs  , and   Dinosaurs  , as well as from the films   Labyrinth  ,   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  , and   The Dark Crystal  , are not considered Muppets, although they were also made by   Jim Henson's Creature Shop  . For a history of   Jim Henson's Muppets  ,   see   Jim Henson  . 

<p>After earlier unsuccessful attempts,   The Walt Disney Company   finally bought the Muppets in 2004. Exceptions include characters appearing on   Sesame Street   (as they were previously sold to   Sesame Workshop  ), the Fraggles of   Fraggle Rock  , along with the above-mentioned non-"Muppet"-brand characters. 

<p>The show's popularity has been so expansive that Muppet characters have been treated as celebrities in their own right, including presenting at the   Academy Awards  , making   cameos   in   Rocky III   and   An American Werewolf in London  , and being interviewed on the   newsmagazine  60 Minutes  .   Kermit the Frog   was interviewed early on in   Jon Stewart  's run on   The Daily Show  , and   Michael Parkinson   once famously interviewed   Miss Piggy   on his UK chatshow. 

<p>Muppet-like and Muppet-inspired puppets star in the 2004   Tony Award  -winning   Broadway   musical   Avenue Q   (which disavows any relationship with Sesame Workshop or the Jim Henson Company). 

<p>America's Next Muppet 

<p>In   2005  ,   ABC   announced it was purchasing a six-episode mini-series titled   America's Next Muppet  . The mini-series is going to be produced by   The Jim Henson Company   for Disney, and is going to be a direct parody of   America's Next Top Model  . The show is going to feature many famous Muppets holding a talent contest to find the next Muppet to add to their famous group. The show was tentatively scheduled to air in spring or summer of   2006  , but there has been no public mention in recent months. 

<p>Regional usage 

<p>In Great Britain and in Ireland the word   muppet   has come to be used as a mild term of abuse, meaning a stupid, incompetent, or moronic person, or the obvious interpretation of someone who is inanimated or somehow not there. It can also be applied (in the   United Kingdom   but not in   Ireland  ) to an aesthetically displeasing individual. 

<p>The   Swedish   translation   mupp   is often used in a similar manner. 

<p>The term   muppetry   is also rapidly gaining popularity as a description for an individual, or group of people collectively behaving in a   muppet   like fashion. The origins are believed to have come from workers in large organisations, who were unhappy with the low to non-existent level of thought or application, that other colleagues put into their work. For example - "I'm sorry the figures will be late this quarter, due to the high amount of   muppetry   going on in the accounts department", or "Gregory's   muppetry   appears to have been infectious." 

<p>Cultural references 

<p>In   The Simpsons   episode 3F15: "  A Fish Called Selma  ", actor   Troy McClure   stars in the fictional film   The Muppets Go Medieval  . Kermit and Miss Piggy are shown as well.

Later in the episode, Selma and Troy McClure are watching the movie on a drive-in movie screen, and before kissing, they speak right along with the characters.

As Tim does some ironing, he explains that there will be no more Muppets when the world ends.
