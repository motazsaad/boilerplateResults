<p>   Storytelling & Use of Narrative 

<p>  The Use of Storytelling in the Department of the Navy (  local copy  ) 

<p>Conveying information in a story provides a rich context, remaining in the conscious memory longer and creating more memory traces than information not in context. Therefore a story is more likely to be acted upon than normal means of communications. Storytelling, whether in a personal or organizational setting, connects people, develops creativity, and increases confidence. The use of stories in organizations can build descriptive capabilities, increase organizational learning, convey complex meaning, and communicate common values and rule sets.  

<p>Description capabilities are essential in strategic thinking and planning, and create a greater awareness of what we could achieve. Fictional stories can be powerful because they provide a mechanism by which an organization can learn from failure without attributing blame.  

<p>With the advent of the Internet and Intranet, there is a larger opportunity to use stories to bring about change. Electronic media adds moving images and sound as context setters. Hypertext capabilities and collaboration software invites groups, teams and communities to co-create their stories. New multiprocessing skills are required to navigate this new world, skills that include the quick and sure assimilation of and response to fast-flowing images and sounds and sensory assaults.  

<p>In summary, when used well storytelling is a powerful transformational tool in organizations, one that all of our managers and leaders across the Department need to utilize.  

<p>  NASA's   ASK   Talks with Dr. Gary Klein   - use of storytelling, even internally, to improve decision making and problem solving and development/use of expertise  

<p>  "Story Model of Decisionmaking" - explained with examples (starting on PDF page 30) in A Literature Review of Analytical and Naturalistic Decision Making (  local copy  )  , by Zsambok, Beach, and Klein, for Naval Command, Control and Ocean Surveillance Center, Dec 1992  

<p>According to the theory, the story coordinates three types of knowledge:  

<p>facts or information from the current situation  

<p>knowledge about similar situations  

<p>generic expectations about what makes a complete story, such as believing that people do what they do for a reason  

<p>Given a set of known facts in an unfolding situation, knowledge about similar situations, and expectations about what is needed to make a complete story, the decisionmaker can know when important information is missing, and where inferences must be made.  

<p>Construct a story  

<p>Evaluate story for coverage - concerns the extent to which the story accounts for evidence  

<p>Evaluate story for coherence  

<p>consistency - concerns the extent to which the story does not contain contradictions  

<p>plausibility - concerns the extent to which the story is consistent with real or imagined events in the real world  

<p>completeness - concerns the extent to which a story has all of its parts

<p>  Storytelling that moves people. A conversation with screenwriting coach Robert McKee  , abstract with PubMed, at National Library of Medicine  

<p>In this conversation with HBR, Robert McKee, the world's best-known screenwriting lecturer, argues that executives can engage people in a much deeper--and ultimately more convincing--way if they toss out their Power-Point slides and memos and learn to tell good stories. As human beings, we make sense of our experiences through stories. But becoming a good storyteller is hard. It requires imagination and an understanding of what makes a story worth telling. All great stories deal with the conflict between subjective expectations and an uncooperative objective reality.

<p>   Ten Commandments of Good Listening - as posted by the Wildland Fire Leadership Development Program  

<p>the first ten - from K. Davis,   Human Behavior at Work  , McGraw Hill, 1972  

<p>Stop talking. Obvious, but not easy.  

<p>Put the speaker at ease. Create a permissive, supportive climate in which the speaker will feel free to express himself or herself.  

<p>Show a desire to listen. Act interested and mean it.  

<p>Remove distractions. External preoccupation is less likely if nothing external is present to preoccupy you.  

<p>Empathize. Try to experience to some degree the feelings the speaker is experiencing.  

<p>Be patient. Give the speaker time to finish; don't interrupt.  

<p>Hold your temper. Don't let your emotions obstruct your thoughts.  

<p>Go easy on argument and criticism. Suspend judgment.  

<p>Ask questions. If things are still unclear when a speaker has finished, ask questions which serve to clarify the intended meanings.  

<p>Stop talking. In case you missed the first commandment.  

<p>additional listening techniques - from P. Bradley and J. Baird,   Communication for Business and the Professions  , Brown, 1980  

<p>Preparation. If you know what the topic is ahead of time, learn something about it so you will not be an ignorant listener. Even some careful thinking will allow you to listen more accurately when the communication actually begins.  

<p>Seek intent. Try to discover the intent of the source; why is he or she saying these things?  

<p>Seek structure. Look for an organizational scheme of the message. If the speaker is an accomplished one, you won't have to look very hard; it will be obvious. But if the speaker is less skilled, the responsibility falls to you.  

<p>Analyze. Do not accept what you hear at face value; analyze what the speaker is saying and pay attention to body language.  

<p>Focus. Keep the main topic of the message in mind at all times, using it to bring focus to the information which the speaker supplies.  

<p>Motivate yourself. This may be the most important. Listening takes work, and to do that you may have to "psych yourself up."

<p>Cognitive Interviewing  

<p>  Cognitive Interview Technique (  local copy  )  , from NTSB - relies more on lengthy narrative responses  

<p>The traditional interviewer asks many questions, each of which elicits a very brief response. The cognitive interview, on the other hand, is in some ways a questionless interview. The goal is to ask as few questions as possible so that witnesses give you long narrative responses that each contains that much more information than a traditional interview. The objective is to try to elicit information, not extract information. The good interviewer tries to create a social environment so the witness generates information without having to wait for questions to be asked.

<p>  Perceptual and Memory Distortion During Officer-Involved Shootings (  local copy  )  , by Artwohl, in   Law Enforcement Bulletin  , Oct 2002  

<p>The developers of this method found that how investigators interview individuals can significantly impact the ability of the witnesses to remember and report the details of an event. Their research indicated the cognitive interview as the most effective technique for facilitating memory retrieval with cooperative witnesses. Using proper interview techniques is particularly important for high-stress situations because during experiential thinking, the individual is more likely to be dissociative and “encodes reality in concrete images, metaphors, and narratives,” whereas, in rational thinking, the individual is more logical and “encodes reality in abstract symbols, words, and numbers.”  

<p>As cognitive interviewing involves thinking aloud on the part of the interviewee, one should keep in mind the following item (which may also apply to cultures other than Asian) from  

<p>  The Geography of Thought: How Asians and Westerners Think Differently… and Why  , by Richard Nisbett, 2003  

<p>To test the possibility that Asians and Asian Americans in fact find it relatively difficult to use language to represent thought, Kim had people speak out loud as they solved various kinds of problems. This had no effect on the performance of European Americans. But the requirement to speak out loud had very deleterious effects on the performance of Asians and Asian Americans.

<p>  FM 34-52 Intelligence Interrogation  , 1992 version  
   NOTE:   some sources believe the 1987 version below was more permissive than the 1992 version above - however, even in the 1987 version below you can see the prohibition against force.  

<p>  Principles of Interrogation  , in Chapter 1, FM 34-52 (1987 version, now superceded) - included the following  

<p> Interrogation is the art of questioning and examining a source to obtain the maximum amount of usable information. The goal of any interrogation is to obtain usable and reliable information, in a lawful manner and in the least amount of time, which meets intelligence requirements of any echelon of command.  

<p>   ... 

<p>   The use of force, mental torture, threats, insults, or exposure to unpleasant and inhumane treatment of any kind is prohibited by law and is neither authorized nor condoned by the US Government.   Experience indicates that the use of force is not necessary to gain the cooperation of sources for interrogation. Therefore,   the use of force is a poor technique  , as it yields unreliable results, may damage subsequent collection efforts, and can induce the source to say whatever he thinks the interrogator wants to hear. However, the use of force is not to be confused with psychological ploys, verbal trickery, or other nonviolent and noncoercive ruses used by the interrogator in questioning hesitant or uncooperative sources.  

<p> The psychological techniques and principles outlined should neither be confused with, nor construed to be synonymous with, unauthorized techniques such as brainwashing, mental torture, or any other form of mental coercion to include drugs. These techniques and principles are intended to serve as guides in obtaining the willing cooperation of a source. The absence of threats in interrogation is intentional, as their enforcement and use normally constitute violations of international law and may result in prosecution under the UCMJ.  

<p> Additionally, the inability to carry out a threat of violence or force renders an interrogator ineffective should the source challenge the threat. Consequently, from both legal and moral viewpoints, the restrictions established by international law, agreements, and customs render threats of force, violence, and deprivation useless as interrogation techniques.

<p> Some NLP Presuppositions  

<p>The map is not the territory. [Our senses filter everything we experience.]  

<p>What you believe either is true or becomes true.[Perceptions are individual and influence behavior.]  

<p>The mind and the body affect each other.[Thought, emotions and behavior are interconnected.]  

<p>Knowing what you want helps you to get it.[Identify your goals and break them down into manageable tasks.]  

<p>The meaning of your communication is the response you get.[Communication is not your intention; it is an experiential process.]  

<p>There is no failure, only feedback.[Stop blaming yourself if something isn't working. Try something else!]  

<p>Communication is verbal and non-verbal.[You are always sending and receiving messages.]  

<p>Modeling excellent behavior leads to excellence. [Find the model and follow the pattern.]  

<p>There is a positive intention behind every behavior.[People respond in the only way they know how at the time.]

<p>  The source of belief bias effects in syllogistic reasoning  , NIH summary of study by Newstead et al, Department of Psychology, University of Plymouth, UK  

<p> In studies of the belief bias effect in syllogistic reasoning, an interaction between logical validity and the believability of the conclusion has been found; in essence, logic has a larger effect on unbelievable than on believable conclusions. Two main explanations have been proposed for this finding. The selective scrutiny account claims that people focus on the conclusion and only engage in logical processing if this is found to be unbelievable; while the misinterpreted necessity account claims that subjects misunderstand what is meant by logical necessity and respond on the basis of believability when indeterminate syllogisms are presented. ... [five experiments were run] ... It is concluded that people try to construct a mental model of the premises but, if there is a believable conclusion consistent with the first model they produce, then they fail to construct alternative models.

<p>Uses metaphors to describe organizational relations. Includes quote below.  

<p>"Metaphor is often regarded just as a device for embellishing discourse, but its significance is much greater than this. The use of metaphor implies a way of thinking and a way of seeing that pervade how we understand our world generally. . . . Metaphor is inherently paradoxical. It can create powerful insights that also become distortions, as the way of seeing created through a metaphor becomes a way of not seeing." - from Gareth Morgan,   Images of Organization  , 2d ed. (Thousand Oaks, Calif.: Sage Publications, 1997), 4-5.  

<p>  The Digital General: Reflections on Leadership in the Post-Information Age  , by Harig, in   Parameters  , Autumn 1996  

<p>Just as there are plentiful examples where critical scientific breakthroughs have occurred while the right brain (our intuitive, pre-verbal cognitive resource) was operating ahead of the pack, strategic vision requires an ability to think in metaphors, to seek related patterns in unrelated objects, situations, and events. True, our future senior leaders will have access to more information. The successful ones will be those who are best able to sort out the important from the interesting. The development and testing of analogies--the patterns that allow leaders to see the important under data overload, is a skill that could waste away under a sterile diet of expert systems and virtual reality simulations.
