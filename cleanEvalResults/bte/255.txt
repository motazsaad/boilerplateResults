<p>If eyes are the window to the soul then the skin around them is the true confession of age, stress, eating habits, and more. This unfortunate fact is the result of the eye's minimal support structure. "The tissue around the eye is the shallowest tissue on the face. And because it does not have oil glands or a fatty layer, it is more susceptible to wrinkles and the effects of aging," says Michelle Ribadeneira, a former Estee Lauder beauty advisor. 

<p>  
 Skin care professionals agree that products specifically created for the eyes are the only way to treat the delicate area. Says Ribadeneira, "Traditional face products are too heavy for the eye, as a result they clog pores and create bags and wrinkles."

<p> A slew of eye care solutions are available, and they generally come in gels and creams. While gels do not pack as much moisturizing power as creams, they're a better choice for some. "People with oily skin, sensitive skin or acne should look for an eye gel," says Christina Cusumeno, aesthetician and skin care specialist for Faline's Skin Boutique in Scottsdale. 

<p>  
 Consult a skin care expert to determine your skin type, but buyer beware, advises Ribadeneira. "Don't be limited by the brand a skin care specialist's spa or dermatologist sells; know what your specific needs are," she said.  

<p>   What to buy 

<p> Cusumeno suggests products with chamomile for tired, puffy eyes and products with kojic (a plant derived acid) to relieve dark circles or create lightning and brightening. But she too adds a second important warning: Stay clear of products containing coal-tar colors (listed as FD & C or D & C on the label); this ingredient is prohibited by the Food and Drug Administration, in large part because it can lead to blindness. 

<p>   Double dippers beware 

<p> Once the perfect eye care product is found, learn to apply it correctly for optimal benefits. The first rule, according to Ribadeneira, is to use the product every morning and night. "Just like a diet, if you only eat well and exercise occasionally, results won't come." With consistent care, Ribadeneira says, you can expect to see changes within six to nine weeks. 

<p>  
 The eye area is high in bacteria, making sanitary application vital as well. Pop the top off a Q-tip, dab a pin-prick amount on the applicator and pat lightly around the lower eye area (and sometimes the lips but never the lids) from corner to corner in a half-moon shape. "Some products come with spatulas, but I prefer disposable Q-tips because they don't tempt double-dipping," says Ribadeneira.
