 If I was being generous I'd say it was fair. However, if I was more honest, I'd say overrated. But my problem wasn't with the food. 

<p>  What did you drink? 

<p>  Bottled beer and house wine. Slightly pricey, but tasted nice. 

<p>  What's the crowd like? 

<p>  Couples of all ages.  

<p>  And the vibe?  

<p>  Crowded and smokey upstairs 

<p>  Anything else you'd like to say? 

<p>  Was told you can’t book, so turned up without a reservation and had to wait two hours for a table. When we were finally seated, we noticed many tables were unused. Upstairs the bar was packed full of people waiting for tables and downstairs there were LOTS of tables unused? I got the feeling they were just ushering customers upstairs for an hour or two to get a few extra rounds of drinks out of them. Very annoying! Not in a rush to return! 

<p>  Value for money? 

<p>  I paid £8 for a plate of nachos chips with a couple of dollops of salsa for a starter.

<p>  Where is it? 

<p>  York between the Art Gallery and the Minster  

<p>  What's the number? 

<p>  Don't book, enjoy the bar! (01904 637722) 

<p>  What's the grub like, then? 

<p>  Plunketts is part of a Christmas tradition with us. We first visited years ago and have returned regularly (always at Christmas time) on our (at least) biennial shopping visit to York. The food is always excellent and the steaks are cooked just how you order them. I can also speak very highly of the 'bowl'o'red'! This time round we tried the Christmas cake and Godminster for dessert, and for a strictly Cheddar-only man like me this was a real treat - Fantastic! However having since purchased some of the aforementioned cheese I have been disappointed not to be able to achieve the same kick.  

<p>  What did you drink? 

<p>  Black Sheep. Its as much a part of the tradition as admiring the view through the bedsit window across the street from upstairs, or banging my head on the low beams.  

<p>  What's the crowd like? 

<p>  Sadly the clientele appear to be getting younger; I say 'appear' because I am a realist and suspect that age wise I now have more in common with the fabric of the building than some of the punters! 

<p>  And the vibe?  

<p>  Soapbox time! Apart from it's everpresent inbuilt charm and ambience, on this occassion I was put off (upstairs at least) by the fug of smoke. The truth is I don't often get out these days and to have an evening as special as this marred (not exactly spoiled) by something as blatantly antisocial (its only social to those who enjoy it) was a tad upsetting. No doubting where I stand on the great debate then! 

<p>  Anything else you'd like to say?
