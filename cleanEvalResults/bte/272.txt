A questions this big and important is better answered when a few people are working on it at one time. Things work even better when a group of you decide to look at the question from different perspectives. This way team members can become experts on different aspects of the question and then come together to poll their learning. This is where team work pays off. So are you ready to divide and conquer this question? 

<p>  Form groups of six.&nbsp; Each group member must research and answer the question from a different perspective:&nbsp;   Vietnamese  ;   Aboriginal  ;   Greek  ;   Italian  ;&nbsp;   British/Irish  ;   New Zealand  .&nbsp;&nbsp; Each group member will consider what it must be like to be a representative of our diverse population.&nbsp; 

<p>  Group members must then re-form to answer the essential question:&nbsp; WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE AUSTRALIAN? 

<p>  Each group will present their thesis in the form of an oral presentation.&nbsp; All six members must speak to the question for a period of no less than 3 minutes per speaker.&nbsp; The team's oral presentation should be structured with an introduction, middle and conclusion (  want help?  ) (which includes an answer to the question).&nbsp;

<p>   Group Synthesis 

<p>  Congratulations!&nbsp; Each person&nbsp; on your team has become an expert on one group of Australians.&nbsp; 

<p>  Before you meet with your group,&nbsp; 
  Check out this site to help you review and organise your data. 

<p>  Guess what, gathering useful information isn't the same as truly understanding a topic. What experts in the field of learning suggest is that you now use that information in a new and challenging way. Then you'll really know about this topic.&nbsp; 

<p>  So with you team members all gathered together, carefully read and try answering the main question for this WebQuest. See where you all agree and where differences arise.&nbsp;  Use information, pictures, movies, facts, opinions, etc you explored to convince your teammates that your viewpoint is important and should be part of your team's answer to the question. Your WebQuest team should arrive at&nbsp; an answer that everyone on the team can live with.&nbsp; 

<p>  Check out this site for help with structuring your oral presentation. 

<p>  Before your group presents its findings, ask yourselves these questions  : 

<p>   Have we worked co-operatively as a group? 

<p>   Are we prepared to give our answer? (practise!) 

<p>   Is our presentation structured? 

<p>   Do we need to prepare any resources? 

<p>   Are our speaking roles evenly distributed? 

<p>   Is the correct question being addressed? 

<p>   What have we learnt? 

<p> 
&nbsp; 

<p>   Your group can now present its thesis in the form of an oral presentation.&nbsp; All six members must speak to the question for a period of no less than 3 minutes per speaker.&nbsp; The team's oral presentation should be structured with an introduction, middle and conclusion (which includes an answer to the question).&nbsp; 

<p>   Real World Feedback 

<p>  Research contacts you can make for each of the six ethnic groups and write a letter to each of them asking&nbsp; for an answer to the question:&nbsp; What Does it Mean to be Australian?&nbsp; Compare/contrast your conclusions with the replies. 

<p>   Conclusion 

<p>  At the beginning of this activity, you were asked about the truth. Did you discover it? Was there only one? Did everyone on your team think so? How did you answer the main question for this WebQuest?&nbsp;
