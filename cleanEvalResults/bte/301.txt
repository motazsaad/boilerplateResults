<p>  Have you ever been stuck in the middle of nowhere with no place to go? 
   Has this happened to you? You're at the campsite or in the middle of nowhere and suddenly nature calls. What do you do? You squeamishly go looking for a quiet spot behind a bush to do your thing. You cautiously avoid the poison oak and ivy. As you carefully squat down and try to relax a snake suddenly comes slithering through the weeds and startles you. What a mess! 

<p> Now when nature calls you can go in comfort where ever you are with the one and only Bumper Dumper  ®  . No more looking for the right spot, no more trying to balance while squatting, and no more surprises from creepy critters. Just park your vehicle in a nice secluded spot, plug the Bumper Dumper  ®   in to your trailer hitch receiver, and VOILA!! A portable toilet sturdy enough to hold 500 lbs. and just as comfortable as using the bathroom at home. You can even set up a privacy screen for complete comfort.

<p>  Has this happened to you? 
   You're driving on a long secluded stretch of road. You and the family had a big dinner at the last restaurant about an hour ago and someone's gotta go. &quot;Can you hold it till the next stop&quot;, you ask. You drive a few miles and the sign says next station 90 miles ahead. Meanwhile, she tells you she needs to go too, but she can wait till the next stop. You keep driving a while and find yourself starting to feel the urge as well. By this time everyone is getting pretty anxious. You finally see the exit to the station and the brain kicks in. Everyone knows it's almost time for relief. You quickly exit and pull in to park. You get the restroom key from the attendant and hurry to open the door.  

<p>  You open the door and see this!!!!
