<p>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond has everything you need to play "house" for real. It's the #1 superstore domestics retailer in the US (ahead of #2 Linens 'n Things), with nearly 700 stores in 44 states and Puerto Rico. The stores' floor-to-ceiling shelves stock better-quality (brand-name and private-label) goods in two main categories: domestics (bed linens, bathroom and kitchen items) and home furnishings (cookware and cutlery, small household appliances, picture frames, and more). Everyday low prices eliminate the need for sales. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond relies exclusively on circulars, mailings, and word-of-mouth for advertising.
