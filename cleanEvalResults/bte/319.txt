  Teamwork Vs. Teams 

<p>  Teamwork and teams have been buzzwords for about a decade. Many organizations want to hook onto the "team" train. Teams are great - in the right circumstances. Teamwork is expected.

Establishing teams and teamwork first comes with understanding of what they are and in what situations they can be effective. Join this workshop to find out whether teams and teamwork are right for you and your company. Topics include: - understanding the difference between teams and teamwork - applying teamwork principles - when and when not to establish teams - effective team characteristics - why teams succeed and why they fail
