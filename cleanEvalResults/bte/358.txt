 &quot;Purity is the opposite of integrity&#8212;the cruelest thing you can do to a person is make her ashamed of her own complexity. The stories of our lives have no morals. Any single conclusion drawn would be false; the episodes, taken together, are untranslatable, incomparable. If we are to conclude at all, we can only conclude against conclusions.&quot; -an excerpt from  Fighting For Our Lives  &nbsp;

<p>  poems from prison   by raegan butcher 

<p>  the book  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;   the poems  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  the author  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;   crimethinc letters series  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;   order book 

<p>&nbsp; 

<p>   this is the inaugural book in the  

<p> CrimethInc. Letters series . . . 

<p>  
 This is   not   the third 'CrimethInc. book,' rather, it is the   first   CrimethInc. Letters book. This is not direct propaganda, nor is it similar in most regards to previous CrimethInc. publications. This is a new voice, a new form, a new idea, but born of the same fires. 

<p>  These are our letters&#8212;to the universe. To each other. This is where we re-write our histories and create our own cultures without the mediation of corporations. When we are too far away from one another for campfire storytelling, we use our own voices here, and we use them to call out across the distance.
