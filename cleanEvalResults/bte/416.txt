<p>In November 1918 she volunteered for service at Bizerta, a strategically important seaport in Tunisia, as a decoder and was highly recommended by her commanding officer, Captain H.J. Rowley. She was turned down as she &quot;had no decoding training&quot;. This inspite of a report written by Edith A May describing the nature of her work in Captain Rowley's office as being &quot;decoding and confidential transport work&quot;.
