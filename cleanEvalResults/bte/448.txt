<p>  State economic development professionals who are responsible for attracting business investment and providing site selection assistance to executives and their consultants were invited in April 2006 to provide an informative article on this simple topic : &quot;Why should a business invest in your state?&quot;

<p>  We publish their    &quot;Point of View&quot; articles   here for convenient reference by executives.&nbsp; Other replies will be published once they are received from the remaining state officials. 

<p>   &quot;Point of View&quot; articles   were contributed by many state economic development officials :

<p>   Congratulations : to Grameen Bank, Bangladesh - and to economist Muhammad Yunus 

<p>  Congratulations to   2006 Nobel Peace Prize   Laureate Muhammad Yunus and the Grameen Bank he founded to promote local economic development and alleviate poverty through microcredit programs. 

<p>  These enabled small groups of poor people in Bangladesh to access unsecured loans in very small amounts for their own self-help business efforts which would not be possible through the traditional bank loan processes.&nbsp; This made it possible for many poor people to find their own path out of poverty through their work and savings, rather than rely on high-cost sources of capital or continuous government aid, social programs, or charity.&nbsp; This development model has been repeated elsewhere as an effective approach to poverty reduction challenges, and adopted by various non-profit charitable organizations as a way to leverage the economic impact of their limited resources. 

<p>  The Nobel Lecture by the winner, typically in December, should be a very interesting presentation, as was the   2004 Lecture   when&nbsp; Prof. Wangari Muta Maathai of Kenya won it for her Green Belt Movement's contributions to sustainable development, democracy and peace.. 

<p>   http://www.nobelpeaceprize.org 

<p>   http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2006/ 

<p>  One of the interesting concepts promoted by Muhammad Yunus and others is the idea of &quot;non-loss&quot; companies with a clear social purpose as their main objective.&nbsp; In short, they are managed like for-profit business ventures, but are not managed for profit maximization, but rather to maximize the desired social impact of their work. 

<p>  This differs from the typical nature of &quot;non profit&quot; organizations, which may similarly focus on trying to achieve good social outcomes, but perhaps more from the perspective of raising and distributing money or other benefits as charity rather than by managing the process for demonstrable results as in a business venture. 

<p>  In other words, a non-profit may measure activity (how much it has given away and to how many) rather than results (what has been changed to achieve sustainable social or economic progress beyond immediate crisis-response).&nbsp; This concept of business-like social ventures has started to catch on with philanthropic business leaders who want to achieve lasting results, as reflected in some of the resources listed in our   Humanitarian / Philanthropy directory  .
