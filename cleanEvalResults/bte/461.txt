 Teaching conversational English is the service project in southern Italy. In the spring and fall, volunteers are needed to teach conversational English to elementary, middle school, or high school students under the direction of Italian English teachers in Manduria, Monopoli, Brindisi and communities surrounding Ostuni. You will assist in each day's classroom work using student texts and established lesson plans provided by the teacher. You'll also have opportunities to depart from the formal lessons. For example, you can serve as a resource on topics of North American culture, including discussions on history, daily lifestyle, sports, and school systems. Some volunteers also teach American songs and games, while others provide instruction on continuing dialogues and writing letters. 

<p>  In the summer, volunteers are also needed to teach conversational English in Ostuni, but you will conduct your lessons much more independently. These are intensive English language programs for children eight to 14 years old. Instead of teaching hand in hand with a local teacher, you and your teammates will work under the guidance of a single local coordinator who will want you to oversee your own lessons.

<p>  How can you be sure you are really making a difference? 

<p>  English has become the international language of commerce and technology. Children and adults all over the world want to learn English as a tool for their future development. That is why the teachers and school administrators in the Pulgia region of Italy invited Global Volunteers to send volunteers to teach conversational English in 1995. The Italian English teachers are very good English grammarians and they are excellent teachers. However, English is their second, third or perhaps fourth language. Students want and need to learn pronunciation, idioms and syntax from native English speakers. With that said, it is apparent that sharing English conversation with a native speaker for only one or two weeks will not greatly enhance a student's ability to speak English. However, working with several native English speakers for many weeks each year - year after year - can have a tremendous positive effect. We know this is the case because the teachers keep inviting us back and enthusiastic students keep showing up for class, month after month, year after year. You can truly make an enormous difference in the lives of Italian students by teaching conversational English, even for just a week or two!

<p>  GETTING THERE 

<p>  Which airport should I book my flight into? 
   When should I arrive in Brindisi?  
   Will someone meet me at the airport? 
   What should I do if my flight is delayed? 
  If I&nbsp;am delayed, what is the absolute latest time I can arrive at the hotel? 
  How can I get from the airport to the hotel? 
   If I am delayed, what is the absolute latest I can arrive at the hotel in Ostuni, Monopoli, or Manduria? 
   What should I do if I arrive prior to the scheduled arrival date? 
   If I am arriving early, where can I stay? 
   Will Global Volunteers make a reservation for me at the team hotel if I arrive early? 
   At what time and on what date can I depart Italy? 

<p>  Which airport should I book my flight into? 

<p>Please schedule your arrival at the airport in Brindisi, Italy (airport code BDS).  

<p>  Back to top 

<p>  When should I&nbsp;arrive in Brindisi? 

<p>  Please book your arrival at Brindisi airport no later than 6:30 PM on the service program arrival date. If you cannot arrive by 6:30 PM, you can either arrive a day or two early and stay at your own cost in Brindisi or the community where you will be serving, or arrive later that evening and make your own way to the hotel. However, if you arrive later, you may miss the initial orientation session scheduled for the first evening. 

<p>  You can also take the train from Rome. If you plan to arrive by train, you can go to Brindisi and meet the rest of the team at the airport. Or, if you are scheduled to go Ostuni, you can go straight to the Incanto Hotel without stopping in Brindisi. All trains coming from the north will stop in Ostuni before going on to Brindisi. You should get off the train in Ostuni (the station is on the outskirts of town) and take a taxi to the hotel. The cost of a taxi is approximately USD8 - 10. 

<p>  

<p>  Back to top 

<p>  Will someone meet me at the airport? 

<p>  If you send your flight itinerary to Global Volunteers at least two weeks in advance of the service program arrival date, your team leader will meet you up at the designated airport during two periods of the day. The first pick up will correspond with the early afternoon flight from Rome, which arrives at approximately 2:00pm. The second pick up will correspond with the early evening flight from Rome, which is at approximately 6:15pm. Your team leader will meet you just outside the baggage claim area and will be displaying a Global Volunteers sign. 

<p>  Back to top 

<p>  What should I do if my flight is delayed? 
   If your flight is delayed or you miss a connection, please notify Global Volunteers at 612-850-4750 as soon as possible of your new arrival plans so that we can inform your team leader. You can call either 800-487-1074 or 651-407-6100 during normal business hours (8 AM to 5 PM Monday through Friday, US central time), or call 612-850-4750 evenings, weekends and holidays. You can leave a voice mail message on any of these numbers if no one answers. However, if it is a weekend or US holiday you must leave the message on 612-850-4750. If you must leave a message, it is important that you also contact the hotel where you are scheduled to stay and leave a message for the Global Volunteers' team leader. 

<p>  Back to top 

<p>  If I&nbsp;am delayed, what is the absolute latest time I can arrive at the hotel?  &nbsp; 
   Our orientation sessions are a critical component of the preparation for your assignments. If circumstances beyond your control prevent you from reaching the program on the opening day of the program, then we ask that you arrive no later than 9:00 AM on the following day. 

<p>  Back to top 

<p>  How can I get from the airport to the hotel? 

<p>  Teams serving Ostuni or surrounding communities will be lodged at the Incanto Hotel in Ostuni proper. The Incanto is about a 30-minute drive from the Brindisi airport, with most of the route being north along the main coastal drive. Curbside taxis from Brindisi to the Incanto Hotel cost about USD60. 

<p>  Teams serving in Monopoli will be lodged at the Clio Hotel in downtown Monopoli.

<p>  What are the sleeping accommodations? 

<p>  For Ostuni-based programs:&nbsp; 

<p>  Volunteers stay at the Incanto, which is an elegant and charming Italian hotel. The rooms are double occupancy, although single rooms are available for an additional fee. Volunteers are placed in double rooms unless the composition of the team requires a single or unless a supplemental fee is paid to Global Volunteers. Please note that energy-saving laws in Puglia prohibit hotels from turning on their heating systems until mid-November, so if you're traveling during the late fall, you may want to bring warm sleeping attire. The Incanto is located two miles from the old town square and the more modern downtown, where a pharmacy, bank, grocery store and other shops are available. Transportation is by taxi or local bus. 

<p>  For Monopoli-based programs: 

<p>  Volunteers stay at the   Hotel Clio,   a large tourist-class hotel overlooking the Adriatic. Volunteers are placed in double rooms unless the composition of the team requires a single or unless a supplemental fee is paid to Global Volunteers. All rooms have access to a TV sitting room centrally located for general use. Please keep in mind that energy-saving laws in Puglia prohibit hotels from turning on their heating systems until mid-November, so if you're traveling during the late fall, you may want to bring warm sleeping attire. The hotel is a short five-block walk from the town square and central business district.

<p>  Are single rooms available? 

<p>  For Ostuni-based programs:&nbsp;  Single rooms are available for an additional fee. To secure a single room, you must pay Global Volunteers the single supplement charge no later than 30 days prior to the start of the service program.   Singles are sometimes limited and thus are available on a first come basis. When available, the cost of a single supplement is USD   $336 for one week and USD $448 for two weeks. 

<p>  

<p>  For Monopoli-based programs:&nbsp;  Single rooms are available for an additional fee. To secure a single room, you must pay Global Volunteers the single supplement charge no later than 30 days prior to the start of the service program.   Singles are sometimes limited and thus are available on a first come basis. When available, the cost of a single supplement is USD   $345 for one week and USD $465 for two weeks. 

<p>  (Hotel prices are subject to change. Please confirm with a volunteer coordinator that these prices are still available)  

<p>  Back to top 

<p>  What are the bathroom facilities? 
   Each room has a private bathroom with shower. As taking baths is more common than showering in this part of Europe, many shower stalls are fitted with only very thin curtains, thus allowing water to get on the bathroom floor. Because most of the bathrooms have faux-marble floor tiles that can get slippery when wet, we recommend that you bring rubber shower slippers for extra safety.  

<p>  Back to top 

<p>  What are the laundry arrangements? 
   Neither of the hotels offers complementary laundry service, but there are laundry mats in town and often the hotel can deliver the clothes for you. It costs approximately USD4 - 5 to launder a shirt on your own; if you ask the hotel to assist you, the cost can range as high as USD8. We recommend you ask the price in advance, as prices vary by the garment. 

<p>  Back to top 

<p>  What about electricity? 
   The current in Italy is 220V. You should bring a converter (to 220V) and an adapter (the large round double-pronged version used throughout Europe) for your electrical appliances unless they are dual voltage. 

<p>  Back to top 

<p>  If I am arriving early, where do I stay? 
   (If you arrive in Italy prior to the start date of the service program, you may choose to stay at one of the hotels that Global Volunteers uses (the hotel will depend on the location of your program). Following is the contact information:

<p>  What is the local cuisine? 

<p>  The food in this part of Italy is wonderful. The breakfast is light -- fruit, cereal, rolls, cheese, yogurt, juice and tea or coffee. Lunch and dinner consists mostly of antipasti, pasta, seafood, various meats (particularly beef, chicken and veal), vegetables, and soups. A typical meal will have bread, a salad or soup, two small main courses, and then dessert or fruit. 

<p>  Back to top 

<p>  Where do we eat? 
   Each of the three hotels has a large dining room where we eat both breakfast and dinner. We have lunch at local restaurants. 

<p>  Back to top 

<p>  Can special diets be accommodated? 

<p>  
 Avoiding meat is not a problem. Strict vegetarians or vegans are more difficult to accommodate, although it is certainly possible. Volunteers with such strict requirements will eat mostly pasta, bread, and vegetables, although egg and butter are used in many such recipes. Consider bringing familiar foods to supplement your diet if you have especially restrictive needs. 

<p>  

<p>  Back to top 

<p>  Will potable drinking water be provided? 

<p>  The tap water in southern Italy is generally safe, although bottled water is readily available.

<p>  CLIMATE 

<p>  What is the weather like? 
   How does the temperature vary? 
   What is the altitude? 

<p>  What is the weather like? 
   The temperatures in southern Italy range from very warm in the summer months to cold and blustery in the winter. Weather in the early spring and the late fall can be quite variable. For example, in March and November, it is not unknown to have some days approach 65 degrees F while other days the temperature hovers around freezing. If you're traveling between February and early April or between late October and early December, we recommend that you bring clothes for all weather conditions. 

<p>  Back to top 

<p>  How does the temperature vary? 
   January and February are the coldest months, with temperatures ranging from the low 50s during the day to the low 30s at night. June through September are the warmest months. The rainy season begins in October or November and typically lasts until March, and during those months you can expect cool and rainy or damp weather. During the rest of the year, temperatures range between 55 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. 

<p>  Back to top 

<p>  What is the altitude? 
   Ostuni-based teams stay in a hilly area several hundred feet above sea level. Manduria and Monopoli teams are almost exactly at sea level.

   Where do I exchange money? 
   Can I use cash, credit cards or checks? 
   How much money should I bring with me? 

<p>  What is the local currency? 
   The local currency is the euro. As of March 1, 2002, the lira was no longer accepted as legal tender. 

<p>  Back to top 

<p>  What is the current exchange rate? 

<p>  For currency conversion information, refer to the following website:   FXConverter  . 

<p>  Back to top 

<p>  Where do I exchange money? 

<p>  At the airport in Brindisi: 

<p>  The airport exchange is often closed because Brindisi is not an international terminal. Therefore, if you are concerned about not having euros before you get to the hotel, we recommend that you change money in Rome or Milan during a layover. 

<p>  

<p>  In Rome or Milan: 

<p>  

<p>  Most volunteers will have a layover of a few hours in Rome or Milan before boarding a flight to Brindisi. We recommend that you exchange a small amount of money at the airport in Rome or Milan (about USD50 should be enough). 

<p>  

<p>  In Ostuni: 

<p>  
 Beginning on the first Monday of the service program you can exchange money in Ostuni at several different banks. Banks are generally open Monday - Friday from 8:00 AM - 1:00 PM and from 3:00 PM - 4:00 PM. 

<p>  

<p>  Back to top 

<p>  Can I use cash, credit cards or checks? 

<p>  Credit Cards. 

<p>  A debit card can be used to get cash 24 hours a day. There are several outside ATM machines in Ostuni, Monopoli, and Manduria that can be accessed anytime of the day. Additionally, a good exchange rate is available with the debit card, and there is no fee associated with withdrawals. A credit card can also be used for getting cash from an ATM (please contact your credit card company for the four-digit PIN number), though there is a service charge as well as interest on cash advances. Credit cards are not accepted at most stores in Ostuni. 

<p>  Traveler's Checks: 

<p>  While traveler's checks are still a safe method of safeguarding cash when traveling, they are not the most convenient. The banks in this area of Italy are not as accustomed to American tourists as are the cities in northern Italy. As a result, the process for changing traveler's checks can be arduous. There can be as much as a 30-minute wait, and most businesses close between 1:00 PM and 5:00 PM, making it difficult, though not impossible, to plan trips to the bank within the program schedule. 

<p>  Cash: 

<p>  If you are bringing U.S. cash, bear in mind that torn, worn, or defaced bills are often not accepted. Torn traveler's checks might also not be accepted. US 100-dollar bills are sometimes viewed with suspicion at smaller banks, though at large ones, particularly those in large cities, the $100 bill is the one most commonly exchanged. In the towns where we serve, volunteers have had no problems exchanging $20 and $50 bills. 

<p>  Back to top 

<p>  How much money should I bring with me? 
   How much you bring depends on your personal spending and shopping habits and whether or not you want to go on an excursion during free time on the weekend. Weekend trips can cost between USD100 - 300, depending on where you go, and the transportation and accommodations used. Your souvenir budget is discretionary. Most shops are open for business during the morning hours and then are closed in the afternoon from 1:00 PM &#150; 3:00 or 5:00 PM. Stores then re-open in the evening around 7:00 PM. Postage for postcards costs about .60 euros.

   Can I&nbsp;make phone calls from my room? 
   Is internet service available? 

<p>  How can my family contact me while I am in Italy? 

<p>In the event of an emergency, your family should refer to the contact sheet that you will receive prior to your departure for Italy. This will include phone numbers for the hotel where you will be staying, our hosts in Italy, and Global Volunteers business and after hours phones. Be sure to leave a copy with them. 

<p>  Back to top 

<p>  What about international phone calls? 

<p>  There will be phones and faxes locally available for you to use for international communication. However, using locally purchased phone cards is usually cheaper than calling directly through the hotel. 

<p>  Can I&nbsp;make phone calls from my room? 

<p>  The rooms at the Incanto have a telephone (dial 0 to place calls; dial 9 to reach the front desk). You are responsible for any charges for calls made from your room. 

<p>  Is Internet service available?
