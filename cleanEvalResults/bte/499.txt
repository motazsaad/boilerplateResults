<p> Chicago, IL 60622 
   www.teamsdesign.com 

<p>Originally planned for December 2002, this book club review has been rescheduled once again for March 18th. It turns out the only two times we&#146;ve gotten any real snow this winter have been the days book club was scheduled. We&#146;ll, we&#146;ve decided to give this book one more chance. So, please come out and join us for some lively chat at TEAMS new location. 

<p>Note: Book Club is looking for their next book to review. If you have a book you&#146;ve recently enjoyed, please bring it along for discussion. All are welcome. 

<p>After the previous books were wide-ranging in scope, it's time now for us to take an introspective look at our own profession with John Heskett's new book   Toothpicks and Logos  . The author of the 1981 book &quot;Industrial Design&quot; (an essential item on every self-respecting industrial designer's bookshelf) he now succeeds to define industrial design by reflecting it against modern contexts such as cultural, technological, environmental and corporate influences. 

<p>&quot;Design is one of the basic characteristics of what it is to be human, and an essential determinant of the quality of human life.&quot; - a principle that nurtures his book as much as our profession. 

<p>If you don't make it there, then book is also available on-line at Amazon:

<p>  Chicago Fight Club 
   June 26 at Teams Design 

<p> 1812 West Hubbard St. 

<p> 7 pm 

<p>Building on the success of the Book Club, the Chicago chapter is setting up a new social event for Chicago Designers. Paul Hatch: &quot;We found that the chief attraction of the Book Club is the social aspect of the meeting, which typically only briefly focuses on the chosen book. Discourse then ran the full gambit of topics.&quot; 

<p>Fight Club is a more targeted discussion, around a chosen topic of debate such as a film, TV show or current exhibition. The first meeting will be centered on the film Matrix Reloaded. Here, two volunteers will take extreme pro and contra angles to debate the merits and pitfalls of the film, the actors, and the genre. Everyone else can add their spice to the debate on either side.  

<p>First Rule of Fight Club: There are no debating rules. 

<p> Second Rule of Fight Club: There can only be one winner. 

<p>Being able to articulate and defend your opinion is one of the most 

<p> important skills a designer could have, and one that is rarely taught in school. Join us on June 26 for the very first IDSA verbal slugfest.

    IDSA Chicago&#8217;s Second FIGHT CLUB  , November 20. 

<p> &nbsp; 

<p> After the success of the first Fight Club we knew there had to be a follow up debate, so here it is:   Sex and Violence  . 

<p> &nbsp; 

<p> Most of Europe and Canada have less than 100 mortalities per year through violence, whereas the US averages around 11,000 through guns alone. The US has also cornered the market in its pornography business and yet has one of the tightest restrictions on nudity on TV. Is it not also contradictory to blur out partial nudity while we can watch decapitations in full gory detail on primetime TV? 

<p> &nbsp; 

<p> This no-holds barred &#8216;street debate&#8217; will cover these topics and also discuss the effects sex &amp; violence has on TV viewers, what censorship does, etc.&nbsp; 

<p> What is Fight Club? Picture this: 

<p> &#8211; Two fighters under a spotlight, circled by 50 onlookers. 

<p> &#8211; One subject matter, two radically opposing opinions. 

<p> &#8211; Darkened empty loft space, multimedia backdrop. 

<p> &#8211; Angry questions, careful answers, and heartfelt arguments. 

<p> &#8211; One winner. 

<p> &nbsp; 

<p> Two volunteers -the fighters- take extreme for and against stances to debate the merits and pitfalls of the subject. Everyone else adds their spice to the debate on either side. 

<p>First Rule of Fight Club: There are no debating rules. 

<p> Second Rule of Fight Club: There can only be one winner.
