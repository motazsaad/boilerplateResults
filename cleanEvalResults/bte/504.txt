<p>  Swiss Police Acquitted in Aubonne Bridge Trial 

<p>On the 13th, 14th, 15th of February 2006 a   court case against two Swiss police officers   took place in Nyon, Switzerland. Michael Deiss and Claude Poget were   charged with causing bodily harm through negligence  . They were in court after nearly killing climbers Martin Shaw and Gesine Wenzel during the protests against the   G8 in Evian  . On Friday 17 February the verdict of this private prosecution came through with an   acquittal of the two policemen   [Read verdict   press release   by Martin and Gesine]. Following this verdict, the activists announced that they   will appeal   against this whitewash of police violence. 

<p>In June 2003, an affinity group   blockaded the Aubonne Bridge   with a climbing action in order to stop a G8 delegation from reaching the summit in Evian. The police cut the climbing rope. As a result both activists were seriously injured, specially   Martin Shaw   who spent one month in hospital and sustained irreversible injuries. See   video   and a   Photo strory   of the event.

<p>  Councillors Clash on Indymedia over Housing 

<p> Controversy at Oxford City Council hit the pages of Indymedia last month as Green councillor Matt Sellwood accused Labour and Liberal Democrat members of wasting £100,000 in tax payer’s money on the demolition of a block of social housing.  

<p> 
In a   newswire item   posted to this site Sellwood claimed that the council’s decision to demolish Stephenfield House in Rose Hill with council funds would effectively mean a massive subsidy for the private developer’s brought in to redevelop the site. He further alleged that the new development would not be retained as a 100% social housing as the Green party had demanded.  

<p> 
In a reply posting Labour councillor Rick Muir defended the council’s decision arguing that under government regulations they have no choice but to bring in a private developer. He also claimed that the new development once completed will provide more, not less, social housing.  

<p> 
Meanwhile the practise of   squatting   empty, unused properties continues to be necessary in a city of massive house prices and waiting lists.

<p>  Blackwood Tree Camps Evicted - Campaign Continues 

<p>   Update: 29th March: The Campaign Continues!   There are still around 50 trees to be defended, and there are still camps, tree houses being built, and actions taking place - read   Blackwood Protest Continues   and   Status Report  . Contractors Costain will also be holding a public meeting to address concerns and answer questions from local residents regarding the Sirhowy Enterprise Way, at 7pm, on Tuesday, March 30, at the Costain's site office, Cwm Philkins, Oakdale.  

<p> 
Early in the morning on Tuesday 23rd March, around 70 Police, Bailiffs and   specialist climbers   and tunnellers began evicting the tree camps at   Blackwood   in South Wales - where locals have been campaigning against a new road for over a decade [  Pics  ]. Around 10 people were arrested as they resisted in the trees, on walkways, in nets and in a tunnel, some after breaching cordons. At Camp Kerry, one brave activist still remained at the end of the day, and was able to climb down without being arrested. Most of the trees were destroyed, but campaigners say they will continue to resist.  

<p> 
See   Report   and Pictures |   1   |   2 

<p>Also see collected reports (and pics):   Bristol   |   UK 

<p> 
Evictions continued throughout Wednesday as Bailiffs cut people out of lock-ons and most of the remaining trees were destroyed. Some campaigners remain camped on private land next to the road route and are determined to continue opposing the road scheme. See   Report   |   2   |   3 

<p> 
Meanwhile in   London   an   attempted eviction   was also taking place in Kentish Town. At mid morning bailiffs arrived at   several flats   that have been home to a group of squatters for some months. Some of the occupiers took to the roof, whilst a crowd of around 100 people gathered in the road in front of the building.

<p>  Bemused Oxford shoppers meet with walls and checkpoints 

<p> On the 9th of November, as part of the international day of protest and action against Israel's 'security wall', protesters in Oxford (wearing huge white cardboard boxes on their heads) attempted to give the local weekend shoppers a glimpse of life in occupied Palestine. 

<p>  
 People gave leaflets, talked to people and shouted slogans. The 'wall' was seen making its way through the Westgate and Clarendon shopping centres - to the annoyance of security guards, culminating by a walk down Cornmarket and a visit to Marks and Spencer's. Finally, a 'checkpoint' was built on a nearby (pedestrianised) street, until the 'soldier' announced he was taking the 'prisoners' into custody and the wall was taken apart and dumped in a nearby bin. If only the real thing was as easily dealt with...

<p>  Oxford Post Workers Walk Out 

<p>   UPDATE (Thursday 25th):   Striking Oxford postal workers   won   reinstatement yesterday for their two sacked colleagues, and voted to return to work. 

<p>  UPDATE (Monday 22th):   Oxford postal workers voted for continued strike action in the face of management's attempts to break their union, the CWU. This came after management sacked two people as a deliberate provocation. 

<p> 
This weekend, postal workers from Oxford staged a   wildcat strike   in response to agressive posturing from the chief executive, Allan Leighton. The strike started 5pm Friday, and workers intend to remain on strike until Monday, when they will discuss the next step.
