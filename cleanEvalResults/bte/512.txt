<p>We believe the Bible is the inspired and inerrant Word of God. 

<p>We believe in one God; Father, Son and Holy Spirit. 

<p>We believe that we are saved by grace through faith and that is not of ourselves, it is the gift of God. 

<p>  We believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God, that he died for our sins and was raised from the dead, and that whoever believes in Him will have everlasting life.
