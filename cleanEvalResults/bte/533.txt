<p> It is now time to deliver your presentation. It is important to think carefully about the purpose of your presentation, which is to outline the different ways in which further education may be funded and the most cost effective methods for a variety of different student career paths. It is also important to consider your audience.  

<p> You will need to make sure that the style of your presentation is suitable and that you use a range of techniques to interest those listening to you. Rhetorical questions, examples, case studies or analogies are all helpful ways of retaining interest as well as non-verbal forms of communication such as eye contact and body language.  

<p> Use an image - perhaps projected on an OHP - which will help illustrate some of your main points. Design your presentation to last approximately ten minutes. To do this you may need to prepare cue cards to remind you of what to say next. These should be just reminders, not a set of notes that you simply read aloud.  

<p>Did you speak clearly and adapt the style and content of your presentation to suit your audience? 

<p>Did you use a range of techniques to keep the attention of your audience? 

<p>Did you structure what you said to make it easy to follow?
