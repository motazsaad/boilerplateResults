<p>   Introduction to the Materials 

<p> 

<p>The guidebook sets out for each piece:  

<p>an introductory page that sets the scene, describing the circumstances in which the piece was written (where possible, in the composer's own words).  

<p>  1st listenings: Getting your bearings.   Pages that help the listener get an overall impression of the music by discovering landmarks that give an idea of the span of the piece.  

<p>  2nd listenings: Structure.   Explores the way the music is put together (the form).  

<p>  3rd listenings: The icing on the cake.   Guides to some of the things that make the music most admirable to the author--designed to provoke involvement and individual response. This section also contains "secrets of the performance" (about gestur es, expressions, and interactions among the people making the music on the tape) and "can you discover..." (questions to encourage students to explore a little further for themselves).  

<p>  Gathering the threads.   Answers some of the questions brought up in the introduction: "How was the first performance received?" "What then happens to the composer?" "How does this composer fit into musical history?"

<p>   Using   Music Explorer   in a Standards-based curriculum 
  Ideas adapted from Richard McNicol's   Music Explorer Project Book 

<p> 
    The   Music Explorer   package includes a variety of printed exercises useful for individual or for class study. In addition, author Richard McNicol has designed a variety of creative classroom projects. Here are six such projects, chosen for their eff ectiveness in helping students reach the National Standards in Music Education of the United States of America (note that the Music Explorer materials all are directed toward Standard 9: Understanding music in relation to history and culture).  

<p>Note that the sound files that appear in some of these lessons are in MIDI format. You will be able to play them only if your computer is set up to accomodate such files, and the sound quality will depend on the quality of your computer sound card and other hardware.
