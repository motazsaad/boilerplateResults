<p> Does anyone know the open carry status in Tennessee? I'll be travelling there from NC at the end of this week. Also, what about car carry?

<p>   Cannot carry with "the intent to go armed"

<p> From what I understand about the law in TN, you cannot carry on your person or loaded in your car a pistol or any other loaded firearm. If you carry a loaded pistol on your person or in your car, it is defined by law a "carry with the intent to go armed" and is illegal unless you have a license to carry. So I would carry unloaded in a case and seperated from the ammunition. -ICPjuggalo  

<p>   Thanks!!!

<p>  F.A.Q. 

<p>  General Questions on Concealed Firearm Laws 
  Q: Why are "Concealed Carry Badges" frowned upon by most non-newbie ccw license permit holders and police? 
  A:   Because badges are a symbol of authority, they are easily misinterpreted as law enforcement badges, which for a non LEO is a bad thing. Concealed carry licences/permits give no authority, rather, only the permission to carry a concealed weapon. If the state, city, county, or town wanted to issue CCW permits/licences in the form of a badge, they would do so. If you want a badge, join a law enforcement agency or a fire department...their badges are usually quite pretty.
