<p>Suddenly Simple 

<p>My &#8216;earthshaking&#8217; (for me anyhow) revelation on Monday has continued to variously wreak havoc and incite bliss in my consciousness (not to mention my dreamwork).&nbsp; Truly, the shift in consciousness I experienced in my truck at that moment was a massive perceptual re-arrangement.&nbsp; A bit scary, but endurable particularly given the ramification of the insight in almost every area of my life.&nbsp; Despite the $0.10USD words and elaborate psychological theories involved in this insight, the integration that followed has lead to a very simple experiential awareness applicable to most anything I have encountered in the last two days.&nbsp; Even at a corporate level my application of this new knowledge was accepted, respected, and assisted in furthering conceptualization of a multi-national dilemma, eventually to result in a book in an unrelated field, but for which I have supplied the title and premise.  

<p>Interpersonally, I have been struggling somewhat with this in a particular setting in which understanding is easily misinterpreted as sickness.&nbsp; However, my spiritual guide has assured me that a massive progression toward clarity has been set in motion and my discomfort is largely around the potential for conflict that this new knowledge lends.&nbsp; Fortunately, great suggestion was afforded me, and taken wholeheartedly, in how to manage conflict and differences of opinion in this particular social milieu.  

<p> It is surprising to me how my extreme desperation, and eventual submission through exhaustion, continues to be an integral part of my growth.&nbsp; In accepting this, I was initially dismayed at the unfamiliarity of being undeniably and consumingly lost.&nbsp; I see now that this is precisely the step that is required for increased awareness.&nbsp; To relent in direction finding allows one to observe reality for what it is: a falsehood, a misperception.&nbsp; Only then may one process the surroundings for what they truly are, be found, and select (yes, choice) a direction for conscious movement.&nbsp; I do not think that makes much sense and is poorly articulated, but hopefully it will remind me of the basic concept I had in mind this morning.  

<p> Three more books on Taoist philosophy arrived today from Amazon.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I have been given a deadline for a major task and will not be able to enjoy them any time soon. I will instead attempt to complete six months of work in two days: Saturday and Sunday.&nbsp; I may or may not succeed, but I will certainly succeed in trying.&nbsp; For now, I continue addressing the next most pressing project.  

<p> Job #2 changed drastically today as I made a new beginning.&nbsp; This time around, the subject matter involved in the work is dear to me and something that I am enthusiastic about.&nbsp; Some might even suggest I have a certain expertise in the subject.&nbsp; I continue to fight this presumptuous assertion, but must admit that my reasoning for attempt at remaining humble is based on a fine understanding of the fundamental tenets.&nbsp; Again, a paradoxical endeavor, but one that I most fully appreciate and revere, thus lending me what they are calling &#8216;expertise.&#8217; Semantics is Chomsky&#8217;s area.&nbsp; I will stick to feelings in relationships.
