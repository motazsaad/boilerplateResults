<p>  What's Your Reason for Relay? 

<p>  Each one of us has our own personal reasons to Relay, whether it be a family member, friend or even ourselves who has been diagnosed with Cancer. But we all Relay toward the same outcome. Hope drives us all, and we derive our inspiration from the stories and faith of others. &quot;Because of YOU... lives are saved, lives are changed.&quot; The reason why I Relay is to preserve the memory of my Uncle Wallace Campbell, to honor my mother, Myrtle Pake, for her battle and survival of breast cancer and my father, Dennis Pake, who has had melanoma. I also Relay for you so that hopefully you will not ever hear those terrible words “You have cancer”. I Relay to raise funds for research, advocacy and patient support programs. I love fighting for a cure for cancer, bringing hope.  

<p>  The American Cancer Society is at work in communities all across the country providing programs aimed at reducing the risk of cancer, detecting cancer as early as possible, ensuring proper treatment, and empowering people facing cancer to cope and maintain the highest possible quality of life. I am extremely passionate about Relay and seeing this fight to the end. I joined the staff of the American Cancer Society in December 2004 and will happily lose the job of my dreams because of the ultimate goal: finding a cure for cancer. With God as our main supporter and each one of us, one day soon the dreaded “C” word “Cancer” will be just another word in our history books.  

<p>  
 We all have our stories. What is yours?  

<p>  Charlotte King, American Cancer Society 

<p>  I’m often asked why I am so passionate about the Relay for Life.&nbsp; People wonder, is it because I’ve had cancer myself or that I’ve lost a loved one to the awful disease?&nbsp; I Relay because I know it could be me someday.&nbsp; We are all surrounded by cancer every day.&nbsp; We can’t get away from it.&nbsp; I lost a cousin this past week to lung cancer.&nbsp; He was 45 years old and a single dad.&nbsp; The wife of one of my co-workers was diagnosed a month ago with colon cancer.&nbsp; She is 35 years old and has two small children.&nbsp; These aren’t bad people.&nbsp; They haven’t abused their bodies.&nbsp; They’re people just like me.&nbsp; I am thankful every day that I have the health and strength to do something to help find a cure.&nbsp; I’m grateful that I live in a community where people care and are willing to spend some of their precious free time volunteering to raise money and raise awareness.

<p>  On August 11, 1997, I experienced the worst day of my life (or so I thought). My 7 year old son Christopher was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. I always thought this was something that happened to other people. I couldn't believe this was happening to &quot;MY&quot; child. I found out then, and many times since, that it can happen to anyone. As it turns out, May 10, 2001 was the worst day of my life. After a 4 year courageous battle, my &quot;baby&quot; lost his battle with that dreaded disease. 

<p>  With Christopher as my inspiration, I &quot;Relay&quot; so that some day, other children and their parents do not have to experience the horrible disease of cancer and what it does to you physically and emotionally. I don't want any child to have to go through what my son went through and I don't want any parent to have to experience the loss of a child. 

<p>  For me, participating in the Relay for Life helps to make something positive out of something so very negative. I am confident some day there will be a cure for cancer, and I will have the satisfaction of knowing that I played a very small part in it.

<p>  I spent my 26th birthday (October) in Asheville with my dad and his new wife.&nbsp; It was then that my dad decided to tell me something that would forever change my life.&nbsp; He had always complained of gall stones, so decided it was time to have them removed.&nbsp; He'd had his surgery the week before.&nbsp; Come to find out it wasn't gall stones he had been complaining of for the last 15 years, it was intestinal cancer.&nbsp; The doctors did an open/close procedure for a biopsy to determine what all was involved.&nbsp; EVERYTHING...the cancer was touching almost every part of him.&nbsp; For the next 6 weeks, I would travel from Raleigh to Asheville every Friday through Sunday and spend every precious moment with my father.&nbsp; We came to understand each other and express our love, support, faith and being so proud of each other.&nbsp; With God beside him during the night, my father passed away December 4, 1993.&nbsp; Only 6 weeks after they diagnosed him with cancer.&nbsp; We had just celebrated his 56th birthday the night before, with each of his three children there.  

<p>  My dad wasn't alive for some of the most important parts of my life..he never met my husband, nor was he there for my wedding or the birth of my daughter.&nbsp; I do believe that he WAS with me through it all.&nbsp; I feel that I am giving something back to my father by doing the Relay.&nbsp; It makes me feel worth while and I know that he would be so proud.

<p>  In the fall of 1979, a man was told he had a tumor.&nbsp; A tumor, not cancer!&nbsp; On January 12, 1980 this man died. &nbsp;He was my Grandpa.&nbsp; In late August 1990, a lady was told she had a tumor.&nbsp; A tumor, not cancer!&nbsp; On September 18, 1990 she died.&nbsp; She was my Grannie.&nbsp; On December 21, 1998, a man was told he had a mass on his throat.&nbsp; A mass, not cancer!&nbsp; On December 25, 1999, this man died.&nbsp; This man was my dearest and best friend’s husband. &nbsp;In early 2000, a man was told he had a mass in his lungs.&nbsp; A mass, not cancer!&nbsp; On March 10, 2001, this man died.&nbsp; This man was my Uncle. &nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p>  On December 2, 1989, a baby boy was born.&nbsp; A happy, healthy nine pounder.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was such an active little boy.&nbsp; He loved to work on things and figure them out.&nbsp; He loved keys and loved to open things up and see what was inside. He loved his #1 baby.&nbsp; A soft, stuffed little green and white rabbit.&nbsp; He loved his family and his baby sister.&nbsp; That baby boy turned into a little man and on August 11, 1997, which happened to be his grandmother’s birthday, he &nbsp;was treated for strep throat and enlarged lymph nodes.&nbsp; Strep throat, not cancer!&nbsp; He was seven and a half years old. &nbsp;And on May 10, 2001, this little boy died from this dreaded disease called cancer!!&nbsp; This brave and courageous little boy was my great-nephew. This should not have happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;This should not happen to any child or adult.  

<p>  Many other friends and family members have been diagnosed with cancer during this time period, some are survivors and others have lost their battle with cancer. &nbsp;It is time to come together and do whatever it takes to find a cure for this thing called CANCER!! &nbsp;Why do I relay?&nbsp; I hope that my small part will help to save the lives of the rest of my family and the many, many friends that I have.&nbsp; GOD BLESS EVERYONE WHO RELAYS!!!

<p>  I don’t know of anyone who has not been affected by cancer in some way….whether it’s battling this horrible disease personally or watching a loved one suffer.&nbsp;&nbsp; In October 1980, after numerous tests, x-rays, and finally exploratory surgery, my mother’s doctors discovered that she had pancreatic cancer.&nbsp; From the very beginning they gave us no hope and did not even recommend treatment.&nbsp; My family had never had anything to “rock our world” as this did, and being in total denial we refused to accept her fate. &nbsp;An oncologist finally agreed to try chemotherapy but after only two treatments, mother was too weak to go through anymore.&nbsp; After suffering for six months, she passed away April 17, 1981. To this day I haven’t forgotten what she went through and the feeling of total helplessness my family felt because there wasn’t a “cure” to save our mother.&nbsp; Since that time, we’ve lost a dear aunt and uncle to cancer and, although it was not the cause of his death, my dad had prostate cancer when he passed away in May 2001.&nbsp; These are ALL Reasons for me to Relay, and whatever small part I play in raising money for cancer research is a labor of love in memory of these very special people.

<p>   In the spring of 1988, one of my best friends (the pretty blonde in our attached homecoming dance picture) was diagnosed with cancer. For 3 years, she battled this disease, but ultimately lost her battle during our senior year in high school. During that time, I wasn't the friend I could have been...I didn't really know quite what to do or what to say to show her how much I cared. I wish we had Relay in my hometown back then - I know we could have done so much to fight cancer, as well as show our support for our friend. I love seeing families and friends at the Relay, often with the survivors they are supporting - your hard work means so much to them, and to all of us who want to find a cure. Thank you!

<p>   CANCER---this six letter word brings such fear and heartache to so many. &nbsp;My first response as to &quot;Why I Relay&quot; is to say to find a cure! &nbsp;Secondly, I'm reminded of the moments in my life that have been touched by cancer (my mother-in-law surviving breast cancer, my own scare with a suspicious lump, and the death of two mothers this year in my son's 6th grade class). &nbsp; 

<p>   When I was asked last year to walk in the Pittsboro Relay for Life my first thought raced to the death of a dear friend's son. &nbsp; I don't even live in Pittsboro and my immediate response was YES, sign me up. &nbsp;The ache in my heart I feel each time I see my friend eases somewhat when I see all of the Relay teams working so hard to raise money for the American Cancer Society. &nbsp;Working together we are all making a difference----no matter how big or how small the contribution. &nbsp; 

<p>   If you ever question why you do this or you become tired of asking for donations or selling this and that...stop for a minute and think of what others have lost and remind yourself that it could have been your mother, your child, or your best friend who lost their battle. &nbsp; All of the work we do is for those who did not survive and for those who will!

<p>   If you know me...you know I'm a talker. &nbsp;My Grandmother, Alma Brown, was a talker too - except she got the point across in a lot less time than it takes me! &nbsp;She was my best friend and soul mate. &nbsp;She had seven kids, 12 grand-kids, and 11 great-grand-children! &nbsp;Even though I was only one of her 12 grand-kids...she had a unique way of making me feel I was her very favorite. In fact, I even signed all my cards to her &quot;From your favorite Grand-daughter Kay.&quot; &nbsp;You know it takes someone very special to make each one of us feel so special. 

<p>   In January 2000 my Grandmother was diagnosed with renal cancer. &nbsp;She died one month to the day of her diagnosis, February 14, 2000 - Valentine's Day. &nbsp;She accepted what God had given her, but I had a much harder time letting go. &nbsp;I made a choice to try and do something to honor her memory...I just couldn't let her slip away! &nbsp;Cancer may have struck my Grandmother physically, but it actually attacked our entire family - leaving a hole where she used to be. &nbsp;But the Lord is always good and works in mysterious ways and I responded to a request for volunteers for Pittsboro's first annual Relay for Life which was a HUGE success! 

<p>   Now I'd be lying to myself if I ended the story there...my primary reason was to honor my own Grandmother, but there is so much more now. &nbsp;Since being involved with the Relay, I have realized the number of friends, family, co-workers, etc., that have had their lives touched and destroyed in some way by cancer...and I too have had my own scares more than once. &nbsp;I only needed to see the bald head on ONE child to pull at my heart strings, I only needed to hear the cry of ONE parent in sorrow so deep that no-one - not anyone - could comfort, I only once needed to see the tears of my parents at the news of a loss of a friend (and there have been several) due to cancer. &nbsp;And I have only ONCE had to feel the helplessness of not being able to help someone I care about. &nbsp;I Relay because I do believe there is a cure and that we are so close to finding it...and I am helping in some small way to find it! &nbsp;I Relay because I refuse to let this disease to take control and just sit back and watch! &nbsp;I Relay because I can....how could you not?

<p>The Pittsboro Relay for Life committee extends their sympathy to the family of Joey Timmons who lost his battle with cancer on May 25, 2003, just one week after he rode in the survivor lap at our 2nd annual event. 

<p>   Why do I Relay? I have asked myself this several times. I guess that’s why it has taken me to this, my third year involved in the Relay to put it into words. I am lucky. My family has little to no cancer. I have never lost a close relative to this horrible disease. So when I think about why I Relay I think because I was meant to. It is my responsibility to support my community, friends and family by giving back all that I can. I believe that all things happen for a reason and God has allowed me to be involved with the Relay for Life in order to show me cancer, its affects and allow these to touch my life. So when I think about why I Relay it’s to serve my friends and community, to continue the fight against this tragic disease and to touch others lives as I my self have been touched. I can only hope that my efforts compel another person to join this fight.

<p>    Flames of Hope Team Captain 

<p>In 2003, I relayed with The Survivors just to do something to help. This year, I wanted to make a bigger difference, so I decided to form a team of my own. Then in November, I was given an even bigger reason. My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. I felt like the rug had been pulled out from under me. But, I knew we had work to do and I had to be brave and have a deeper faith than ever before. I thank the Lord everyday because the cancer was removed and now she is going through radiation treatments. My mom is a survivor!  

<p>I am co-captain of Bells Angels, from Bells Baptist church. Our church has been hit hard by cancer over the past few years. I felt that if any church congregation had a reason to relay, it's us. So, together with Jennifer Chambers, we put a team together.  

<p>I just wanted to help....no matter how much we raise, I just want to help fight this disease. There is a cure out there, we just have to keep looking. To steal a quote from the late Jim Valvano, &quot;Don't give up; don't ever, ever give up.&quot;  

<p>  Gail Blackwood 

<p>    Bells Baptist Church Team Captain 

<p>  I became involved in Relay because the profound effect that Cancer had on my family.  

<p>  
 I had always thought of my Gramps as Superman. He was never sick, always had energy, loved to Fish, play with his grandchildren, travel and teach us life's lessons. When he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, I was crushed. If cancer could strike this man who I thought was indestructible, who next. Unfortunately, he lost his fight with cancer more than ten years ago. We all miss him dearly. I Relay in his memory! 

<p>  
 My Brother, George, was also struck with cancer several years ago. I had a hard time dealing with his illness. I stayed away because I just didn't know what to say or do or even how to act. I will never be able to forgive myself for that because he needed his family during that time. He recovered and is in full remission. I Relay in his Honor!  

<p>  
 Won't you join me in the Fight!

<p>   Synergistics    Team Captain 

<p>My involvement in Relay For Life was initiated by a &quot;cold call&quot; from Carol Esau in 2003 to form a team from our church. I had not been involved in the first Relay For Life event, but had heard wonderful things about it. I took the challenge, and it turned out to be one of the most meaningful things I have done in my life. When cancer strikes someone you love there is not much you can do but pray, and be supportive. I lost my grandfather to colon cancer, my grandmother was a breast cancer survivor, my father is a melanoma survivor, two cousins died of melanoma at ages 41 and 51, and I have another cousin in her fight with breast cancer, and it does not stop there. My best friend from college days has a 7 year old daughter who was diagnosed at age 4 with liver cancer. She is in her third year after her transplant and doing great! 

<p>At our church alone we have lost several wonderful church members to cancer. We do have cancer survivors in our church and I Relay for them with the hope that they will be with us for a long, long time. It makes me feel good to know that the money we raise at Relay filters into the lives of survivors at some point in time. My hope is that through this fundraising future generations will have alternatives for treatment and a higher success rate for a cure. Everyone is affected by cancer at some time in their life.&nbsp; Our stories are about different people with the same disease, cancer.&nbsp;  

<p>If you get a call to participate in Relay ...&quot;just do it&quot;, everything else will speak for itself.
