<p>  Squirrel Counting 
   Add fun to your early childhood counting curriculum with this preschool activity by   Jana M. 

<p>  Materials: Small dixie cups , squirrel pattern and nuts.&nbsp; 

<p>  Description: Teachers take a squirrel pattern and staple it to dixie cups. Write a number on each squirrel.&nbsp; Now, have the child count out how many nuts they need for that squirrel.&nbsp; Have a different number on each squirrel. You can also have the child take nuts away from the squirrel, to see how many he has left. 

<p>  Comments: Some&nbsp; three's I find are not quite ready for this. I find that by the end of the year they're doing it much better.

<p>  Year 'Round "Seasonal Tree" 
   Share the ideas of the changing season with children just as   Terry H.   does. 

<p>  Materials: Large paper cut out of a tree with bare limbs. 
  Summer - - green leaves 
  Fall - - colored leaves 
  Winter - - Misc. items to be hung on tree (snowmen, mittens, hearts, 
  Easter eggs) 
  Spring - - green leaves 
  Construction paper and tape. 

<p>  Description: We place a large brown tree with bare limbs&nbsp; on a vacant wall.&nbsp; We begin the school year with green leaves on this tree. Teachers can put children's name on individual leaves. The children enjoy seeing their names placed around the room. I generally put flowers at the base of the tree and a sunshine could be put up over the tree. 

<p>  FALL  :&nbsp; Gradually start changing the green leaves to fall colored leaves.&nbsp;  Once they have all changed, have them begin to "fall to the ground" until  the tree is bare.&nbsp; We make pumpkins to put under the tree to replace the flowers and at halloween time add faces to these pumpkins. 

<p>  WINTER:  &nbsp; Explaining the seasons to the children, we tell them about  summer and fall.&nbsp; Since our tree is now without leaves, during the winter  we will add our own "special" things to the tree. We make: 

<p>  Snowmen in December 
  Mittens in January 
  Hearts in February 
  Easter Eggs in March. 

<p>   Then the leaves begin to reappear for the spring. 

<p>  New for this year, we're adding apple blossoms (made from tissue paper) to the tree in September and then change those blossoms to apples. Showing it as a fall apple tree&nbsp; (before we do the color change on the leaves). 

<p>  Comments: This was a new idea for last year. We are going to use it this  year to really discuss the changing seasons and also incorporate our  apple lessons.

<p>   Color Song:&nbsp; Leaves on the Trees 
   During this Autumn activity preschool children stand in a circle, sing this song and perform actions to the tune of "The Wheels on The Bus". 

<p>  The leaves on the trees come tumbling down, 
   Tumbling down, tumbling down. 
   (  Children flutter their hands and fingers down to the floor each time the phrase 'tumbling down' is repeated  ) 

<p>  The leaves on the trees come tumbling down, 
   All over town. 
   (  Children flutter hands down, then turn around  ) 

<p>  The leaves on the trees are red red red, 
   Red red red, red red red, 
   (  Everyone wearing red clothes goes to the middle of the circle and shakes themselves  ) 

<p>  The leaves on the trees are red red red, 
   All over town. 

<p>  The leaves on the trees are green green green, 
   Green green green, green green green. 
   (  Everyone wearing green goes to the middle of the circle and shakes  ) 

<p>  The leaves on the trees are green green green, 
   All over town. 
   Repeat for orange and yellow leaves 

<p>   Lots of   Color Activities   are in the   Rainbow Resource Room  . 

<p>  Leaf Classification Bar Graph 
   This preschool education lesson plan begins outdoors, takes advantage of Autumn's colors and encourages young children's classification and sorting skills as they work with concrete materials and compare amounts. 

<p>  You will need: 
   Enough large paper bags for half the children in your group, tape, glue/glue stick, craft paper and a felt tip marker&nbsp; 

<p>  In advance explain to preschool children that they will collect fallen leaves.&nbsp; Remind children not to put leaves off plants, bushes or trees.&nbsp; Only collect the leaves that have fallen on the ground.&nbsp; Encourage young children to use the "buddy system" when collecting (two preschoolers share each collection paper bag).&nbsp; As the children collect leaves teachers use descriptive words, "I see you've found 3 orange leaves" etc. 

<p>  Back inside the preschool classroom, during small group time, sort the leaves according to color, size or kind.&nbsp; Together with young children count how many of each color, size or kind.&nbsp; Are there more brown leaves than green leaves? 

<p>  Creating a   vertical bar graph   will help children compare the leaves according to a classification category such as color etc. On craft paper teachers list the leaf colors.&nbsp; Next ask children to tape or glue leaves in the appropriate color column.&nbsp; Display on children's eye level and refer to the bar graph often during the fall season.
