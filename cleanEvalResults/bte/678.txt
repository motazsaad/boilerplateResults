 This is the page which has been publicised in a number of Magazines and Newsletters, and is largely responsible for winning us the above awards! We think it is fairly unique. 

<p>  You may spend Hours on this Page listening to some of the best Fifties Music on the Web, so bookmark it now, so you may return. If you enjoy it, please pass it along! 

<p>  Notice! 

<p>  I have made some major changes to all &quot;Jukebox &quot; pages. This is the result of a growing number of EMails saying various &quot;Jukebox&quot; pages not working. 

<p>  Jukebox pages can accomodate only one user at a time, and users remain on the page until selections have played. The rapidly growing number of hits on jukebox pages coupled with the time factor is causing problems. 

<p>  To alleviate this congestion, I have added an &quot;Alternate&quot; page for all jukeboxes. 

<p>  If songs are not loading or playing   Click the Button Below   to enter an &quot;Alternate identical page.  

<p>  Also, remember the Jukebox pages do not work with the Realone Player. The solution for this problem is on the Fifties Menu page. If you are using the Realone Player please check it out also. 

<p>  Cllick for Alternate page.  

<p>  Play your   individual selections   in Streaming Real Audio! 

<p>  Just like a real Jukebox. (Except it doesn't eat Quarters!) 

<p>  To make Selections, press and hold down the Control Key (Ctrl). Click each selection you wish to play, or to select all, press and hold down the shift key, click the top file, scroll down, and click the bottom file. When you finish making your Selections, release the Control Key or shift key, and Click on &quot;Play These&quot;. MAC users, try the Command (Apple) key or the Shift key! We are receiving conflicting reports on MAC!  

<p>  Important! 

<p>  To make multiple selections press and hold down the Control key while clicking on your selections.
