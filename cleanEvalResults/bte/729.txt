<p>Share Our Strength's Operation Frontline is a nutrition education program that fights childhood hunger by teaching families how to make healthy and budget-wise food choices.  

<p>Operation Frontline's   hands-on classes   are taught in the kitchen by professional chefs and nutritionists who volunteer to share their strength by teaching nutrition, cooking, and budgeting to low-income adults and children. The goal of Operation Frontline is to provide a long-term solution to hunger and poor nutrition by teaching participants how to select, purchase, and prepare healthy low-cost food for their families.  

<p>   Since 1993, Operation Frontline has provided effective nutrition education to over 32,000 low-income families facing hunger and poor nutrition.   Operation Frontline programs   are run in 14 states across the country in partnership with city-wide social service agencies. Local programs provide Operation Frontline's   volunteer-led   classes at after school programs, family support centers, Head Start agencies, health clinics, and other community nonprofits.
