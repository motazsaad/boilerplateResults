   Please note that more info on all these ships can be found in the alphabetical ship lists. 

<p>  Sent to me by a visitor to my website, Christoffer Hannevig, the grandson of Hans Hannevig (owner of   M/T Irania  ). He and his brother Thor Daniel have done extensive research on these ships, and have compiled this information. More information on the majority of these vessels can be found under their respective letters of the alphabet on my Merchant Fleet pages. 

<p>Information from a PM by Berger of Nortraship's home fleet department dated 7th May 1947. Additional information (by C. Hannevig) included in   Italics  . My own comments and additions will be in   green italics  .

 Post War   - the owners of the above nine ships were put on notice of prosecution according to para 7 of the provisional order of May 18-1940. Hans Hannevig was the only person to be prosecuted. The report sent to London by Smith in the Norwegian Legation in Stockholm referred the vessels sailing according to orders from the owners. The Swedish foreign office files records an interveiw with Smith on the same day as the above report being sent to London, that the legation had allowed the vessels to sail on account of the need for fuel oil for the fishing fleet (see C. Hannevigs mail at the end of this page).  

<p>  NOTE:  Paragraph 7 in the Provisional Order of May 18-1940 says that failure to abide by the rules of the order is punishable by imprisonment for up to a year, or fines up to onehundredthousand Norw. Kr., or both, if the case does not already merit heavier punishment. The same goes for those who contribute to such failure. Also, the ship, or the value of the ship could be subject to confiscation for the benefit of the State.

<p>39. 

<p>  Kora  * - Bergenske Dampskibsselskab, Legation gave permission to sail to Norway.   817 gt. Released July 15-1940. 

<p>40. 

<p>  Eastern Foam   - Very small vessel, permission to sail to Norway.   Left in May-1940. This vessel was only 48 gt and would not have been covered by the provisional decree of Apr. 22, which only included ships over 500 gt. (See my page &quot;Nortraship&quot;). However, the provisional decree of May 18 also covered smaller ships. 

<p>41. 

<p>  Resolut -   Hjalmar A. H. Wiik, Bergen.  194 gt, permission from Nortraship to sail to Norway.   Relased July 6-1940. 

<p>42. 

<p>  Leonard III   - Fredrik Olsen.   Returned to Norway in May. 110 gt, would not have been covered by the provisional decree of Apr. 22-1940. 

<p>  
 The above 13 vessels returned to Norway under differing circumstances, but to quote the Skipsfartsdirekt&oslash;r Lars Usterud Svendsen &#147;As the situatuon was at the time, I consider it to be in conformity with responsible authorities' attitude and in Norwegian interests that such ships were brought home from Sweden&#148;. 

<p>  Christoffer Hannevig adds in an e-mail to me: 

<p> &quot;The reason that the tankers were put into service with the co-operation of the Norwegian authorities in Stockholm is that the issue of these tank ships had been raised prior to the Invasion of Norway. Correspondence shows that the five largest oil companies were mandated by the Government to maintain strategic reserves, and in response they wrote to the supply department requesting assistance in chartering tonnage, this being on account of fact there was a shortage because of the Tonnage agreement with the UK. 

<p>Director Lind of &Oslash;stlandske and officials from the supply department in Oslo travelled to Berlin in early August 1940 and purchased oil from Romania which was then transferred by rail to Stettin. The Shipsfartsdirectorate in Oslo took   Irania  ,   Borgny   and   Inger Johanne   on timecharter and they then arranged voyage charters with &Oslash;stlandske to bring the oil back to Norway. The reason given for the release of the tankers, by Smith of the Norwegian Legation when in discussion with Swedish Foreign Office, was that they had allowed the tankers to depart on account of the need for oil for the fishing Fleet. It should be noted that at time the tankers were returned a number of other vessels were issued with time charters by the Shipsfartsdirectorate in Oslo, that none of these vessels departed shows the control that the Legation had over the vessels. The case of the nine coal burners bear this hypothesis out also. 

<p>The ships that returned to Norway in August 1940 came home to Norway, with the agreement of the legation and were vetted on an individual basis the Norwegian Ministers in Stockholm. Each vessel had a charter arranged by the Shipsfartsdirectorate. These vessels were returned according to what was legal at that time. The fact that the Germans took control of the vessels in January 1941 is irrelevant to the process under which the tankers were permitted to return to Norway.
