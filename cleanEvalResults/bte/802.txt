<p>The Surreal Gourmet 

<p>  Website of the Day: Thursday 24th February 2005 

<p>   &gt;&gt; The Surreal Gourmet  This is cookery for people who don’t much like cooking: “For those with a sense of culinary adventure The Surreal Gourmet serves up fresh attitude towards cooking and entertaining and shows you how dysfunctional kitchens, mismatched dinnerware and low budgets can be easily overcome by a little creativity and an armful of fresh ingredients!”   If you're wondering what the picture on the right of this text is all about, that would be the site's legendary recipe for   Beer-Can chicken  !

<p>Book Crossing 

<p>  Website of the Day: Tuesday 22nd February 2005  &gt;&gt; Book Crossing  I first mentioned this site nearly three years ago, and where Radio 2 leads, Australia’s leading soap follows; Book Crossing featured in a Neighbours storyline last week! Aimed at book lovers, the site invites you to “Set your books free and make the whole world a library” – The idea is that when you’re finished with a book, instead of letting it languish on a shelf, you pass it on by leaving it in a public place for a stranger to find and enjoy. Each book is allocated a unique ID number so you can track its progress and find reviews from other readers.

<p>Chip Cartoon Characters 

<p>   Yesterday in the course of our conversation about   National Chip Week   Steve asked if a chip or French fry has ever ever had a starring role in a film or TV series. So a resounding hats off to listener Paul Callow who emailed to to tip us off about the existence a crime fighting box of chips named Frylock. Frylock is one of the stars of an overnight show on Cartoon Network in the US called Aqua Teen Huger Force. More info on the   Cartoon Network site  .

<p>Audiobooks For Free 

<p>  Website of the Day: Thursday February 17th 2005 

<p>   &gt;&gt; Audiobooks For Free  From the “does what it says on the tin” school of sites, here’s a handy source for novels, poetry or non fiction to listen to in the gym, on the move, at home or at work. Around 500 titles are available as free mp3 downloads, mainly (but not exclusively) classics that are out-of-copyright. The audio is optimised for small file sizes and quick download … which means that at best it sounds like an old recording from a short-wave radio, but you can elect to pay a small charge to download a higher-quality recording.

<p>How to contact your MP 

<p>  Website of the Day: Tuesday February 15th 2005  

<p>   &gt;&gt; Write to Them  This is an enhanced version of a site that was originally launched as   FaxYourMP  . It was put together by a bunch of volunteers to address the fact that many people don't know the name of their MP, let alone how to contact them: The site was designed to make the whole process of finding and contacting your elected representative as easy as possible. The new site expands the service to include local councillors, MEPs and members of the National Assemblies for Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland. To use the site, simply type in your postcode to find details of all your representatives, choose who to write to, type your letter into an online form, and click send!

<p>A prickle of porcupines…  

<p>  Website of the Day: Thursday 10 February 2005 

<p>   &gt;&gt; What Do You Call a Group of.....?  Thanks to Chris Boon for this email:  

<p>  Miles, Ever wondered what the term for a group of jellyfish is? Check out this site:   http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/info/faqs/animals/names.htm  Chris   P.S. it's a &quot;smack&quot; of jellyfish!  

<p>So I decided to investigate Collective Nouns further and it turns out there are hundreds of different sites detailing the collective nouns for different groupings of people, animals and objects. One of the more comprehensive is   Paul Vijay’s collection of collective nouns   but you may also want to try the   Collective Noun quiz at Triv.net

<p>Online Simon 

<p>  Website of the Day: Friday 04 February 2005 

<p>   &gt;&gt; Online Simon  When I was growing up, Simon was the original addictive electronic game. The only thing this online recreation lacks is the tactility. Highly enjoyable and pleasurably nostalgic!

<p>BBC Voices 

<p>  Website of the Day: Wednesday 02nd February 

<p>   &gt;&gt; BBC Voices  This site is part of a big pan-BBC project looking at local and regional accents and dialect. On air the main focus for this will be a week of programmes at the end of August, but the online component is up and running – and very interesting!   Start off by submitting details of your age, where you live and grew up, how you’d describe your own accent and whether you speak any other languages. Then try out the Interactive Word Map, in which you submit the words you use to describe your grandparents, a baby, feeling cold or tired, or being drunk, pregnant or rich.   Over time the site will build up a fascinating picture of how our age, location and background affect the language we use and our accents.

<p>How to declutter your life

<p>   &gt;&gt; FlyLady  Thanks to Fiona Stow for her email encouraging me to revisit this site which I first mentioned a couple of years ago:  

<p>  &quot;I firmly believe that if the website address was displayed in doctors' waiting rooms and plastered across women's magazines, the anti-depressant statistics in this country would plunge!&quot;
