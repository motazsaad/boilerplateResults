 Do you know why   most people don't get the flexible work schedule they want? Right—they don't    ask  .  

<p>  What holds them back?   They're afraid. Or at least nervous. 

<p>  Is that you, too? Maybe you're stalling   because you're nervous about asking your manager for a flexible work arrangement. Well, that's natural and expected—like asking for a raise. Who wouldn't be nervous? 

<p>  But please don't let it paralyze you.   You    have   to ask because nothing will come of your desire for a more balanced life until you do.   The good news? Asking works!   Even with   tough-sell bosses  . 

<p>I regularly hear from career professionals who say they do well on the job, but when it comes to making the flexible work request, their confidence wanes.  

<p>So it's common—and it's conquerable!   Confidence comes with preparation.   So be prepared (see below), then move beyond the fear. You'll be thrilled to discover that   asking   does   work!  

<p>  There's a right way to ask 

<p>  
 If   asking   is the door that leads to getting the time and flexibility you want, then the   Flex Success Proposal Template  is the   PREPARATION KEY   that opens the door   with confidence  . I've seen it happen over and over and over.  

<p>  Here's how other nervous-to-ask people got a flexible work arrangement (excerpts from my files) 

<p>I did a search in my Eudora email program of archived   Flex Success   testimonials that contained the words   nervous, courage, confident   and   confidence  .  

<p>The result was a very l-o-n-g list of entries. Here are just eight examples from my   &#147;  gave-permission-to-post  &#148;   folder.  

<p>  I work in a very large company and reduced work weeks are not part of our world.   I was so   nervous  , but I knew that with the support and backup I got from your [Flex Success] template, I was completely prepared for whatever they would ask me. And I was. They were so impressed; I received several compliments on the proposal. 

<p>  
 I am now [working] three days a week and I am loving it. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!   You gave me the tools I needed, the   confidence   to present it, and now I have a balanced personal and professional life.   Tina Hinzman, Senior Work Process Tools Trainer, Ellicott City, MD

 I received many positive comments and compliments [from my managers] on the thoroughness and overall organization of my written proposal...Using the [Flex Success] blueprint as a guide...  gave me   confidence   and peace of mind that I would not have had otherwise.   Mary Beth McCarthy, Head of Corporate Communications, Attorneys' Title Guaranty Fund, Inc., Champaign and Chicago, Illinois  

<p>  I am walking on air and still can't believe my dream has come true! I truly couldn't have made a better impression without the help of Flex Success. [It] gave me the tools I needed to pursue this alternative work arrangement   with   confidence  .   Thank you...  Shannon Bryant, Healthcare Analyst, Chesterfield, MO

<p>   I am starting a part-time business on the side, but wanted to keep my day job (and the salary that goes with it). My proposal to cut my hours from 9-5 to 11-4 was a great success! The Part-time Flex Success proposal template provided me with everything I needed to create a great proposal, one my bosses couldn't refuse! I really feel it was the best $30 I've spent in the last year.   Your proposal gave me the   confidence to ask   for a lot AND the ammunition to get it. Thank you.   Jill Giese, Account Executive (marketing/communications), Boise, ID  

<p>  ...a lot of the women I work with are happy to see the flexibility my company allows and I am so glad I was   brave   enough to be the   first   one to   ask   for it.   I know I would never have had the   courage   if I had not had your [Flex Success] template   to encourage me! The best money I have ever spent!   Rebecca Jami, Production Manager,&nbsp; (graphics and printing for lobbying firm), Alexandria VA

<p>  My proposal...was completely accepted and approved within two weeks...The [Flex Success] proposal was so professional, detailed, and well-written that no one even asked any questions!&nbsp; I could never have put together such a comprehensive and polished proposal without [it]. 

<p>&nbsp; 

<p>  My only regret is that I did not   ask   for more!&nbsp;   But   now that I have the proper tool, I would feel   confident   if I needed to further restructure my position.&nbsp;   I thank you and so do my husband and my 3 children. Sanity has been restored to our lives! 

<p> &nbsp; 

<p>   Feel free to post any of my comments on your website.&nbsp;Your [Flex Success] program deserves rave reviews!&nbsp; And thank you again for enabling us all to take control of our lives and careers.   Caren Helms, Engineer, Standards Department, Underwriters Laboratories, Raleigh, NC 

<p>I have been commuting from Hamilton, Ontario to Toronto for a year and a half, which takes two hours each way—a total of 4 hours per day! Now that I can work from home three days a week, I'm saving 12 hours of commuting time a week, plus I cut my commuting expenses in half.&nbsp;   I feel like I have my life back. Flex Success gave me the   confidence   to ask my boss   to work from home and I think the professional appearance of the proposal went a long way in getting it approved. Thank you!    Andrea Pond, Electronic Copy Editor, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada
