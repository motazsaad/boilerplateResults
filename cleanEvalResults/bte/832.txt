 Kirk C. Allison, BA, BS, MA, PhD, EMT, Cand. MS 

<p>Dr. Allison was born in Wichita, Kansas, and received his bachelor&#8217;s of science degree in computer science and a bachelor of arts in German from the University of Kansas (with study of   Informatik   at the   Friedrich-Alexander-Universit&auml;t Erlangen-N&uuml;rnberg). He completed a master&#8217;s degree with honors in Germanic Languages and Literatures also from the University of Kansas. In 1987 he received a Fulbright grant to the Ludwig-Maximillian-Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nchen where he pursued studies in German literature, theology (Institut f&uuml;r Systematische Theologie; Institut f&uuml;r Fundamentaltheologie und &Ouml;kumene), and philosophy of science (Institut f&uuml;r Statistik und Wissenschaftstheorie, Seminar f&uuml;r Philosophie, Logik und Wissenschaftstheorie). He also attended lectures in emergency medicine (taking advantage of the   H&ouml;rerfreiheit   of the German university). In 1988 he was a Hans Martin Schleyer Stiftung e.V. Seminar Stipendiat. In Fall of 1988 he returned stateside to pursue a Ph.D. in Germanic Studies with a minor in Comparative Literature at the University of Minnesota, including study at the Ruhr-Universit&auml;t Bochum in 1990. In 1992 he completed an Emergency Medical Technician certification. In 1995 he was a translator/analyst in the Department of Rhetoric for the history of scientific writing (project of Gross, Harmon, and Reidy,   Communicating Science: The Scientific Article from the Seventeenth Century to the Present,   Oxford UP, 2002).  

<p>  &nbsp; 

<p>  In 1996-97, while   Gastlektor   at the Universit&auml;t Salzburg, he conducted a colloquium at Salzburg College on the topic of historical consciousness. His dissertation research at the   Deutches Literaturarchiv   in Marbach, Germany, concerned physician-poet Gottfried Benn (1886-1956). The project investigated   the social location and discourse horizon of Benn&#8217;s medical specialties (military medicine, psychiatry, pathology, dermatology-venerology, and epidemiology) in relation to his literature and ethics (relation to the Hippocratic ethical tradition and confluence of eugenics, aesthetics, and politics). In 1999 b  ackground phenomenological investigations followed at the University of Minnesota concerning physician training, augmented through a Visiting Scholar Preceptorship at the Office of Medical Examiner, Hennepin County, Minnesota, in 2000. 

<p>  &nbsp; 

<p>  Having served on the colloquium committee of the Program in Human Rights and Medicine from 1997-1999 and completing the dissertation (  Gottfried Benn&#8217;s Medical Exotics: Proximities in Literature, the Body and Ethos,   2000, 739 p.), he assumed the duties of Associate Director in July of 2000. He was a consultant for the Human Rights Library study guide &#8220;The Right to Means for Adequate Health,&#8221; made available in English and French in 2003. Recent activities include collaboration on a health insurance disparity project (Covering Kids and Families, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Special Solicitation Grant) and a policy recommendation review for the Minneapolis Department of Health &amp; Family Support and the Hennepin County Human Services &amp; Public Health Department in the context of the state mandated   Eliminating Health Disparities Initiative (MS 145.928)   &nbsp;in 2004. In 2005 Dr. Allison presented testimony for state legislative committees regarding &#8220;Genomics, Ethics and the Public Representation of Science&#8221; and   &#8220;Stem Cell Research Policy: Is Ethics or Science Primary?&#8221; His publications discuss science and ideology, interdisciplinarity, and the concept of human dignity in relation to disability. He has also published research in applied linguistics and translations of poetry by Georg Trakl.   Current projects include a health services research and policy MS (School of Public Health) and translation of a commission document concerning euthanasia in the Netherlands.

<p>  G  EM Anscombe, BA, LLD 

<p> Professor GEM Anscombe, LLD, co-founder of the Program in Human Rights and Medicine and one of the most eminent philosophers in the English-speaking world (writing in the   New Republic  , J.M.Cameron called her: "simply the most distinguished, intellectually formidable, original, and troublesome philosopher in sight"). The Prince of Liechtenstein endowed a chair in philosophy at the Internationale Akademie f&uuml;r Philosophie im F&uuml;rstentum in Liechtenstein and invited Dr. Anscombe to become the chair's first occupant and to give the inaugural lecture for the chair on the 26th of October, 1995. Her lecture, titled "Die Wahrheit Thun" (To Do the Truth), examined the idea of "doing the truth," which has its earliest known expression in the 1st Epistle of St. John (I, vi). Dr. Anscombe was Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at Cambridge University, an Honorary Fellow of St. Hugh's College, Oxford, a Fellow of Somerville College, Oxford, an Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a member of the British Academy. She taught at Somerville College, Oxford, the University of Michigan, the University of Chicago, the University of Minnesota, the University of Pennsylvania, and Johns Hopkins University. Among the many honors and awards she has received are the   Ehrenkreuz Pro Litteris et Artibus   (Austria, 1978), the   Forschungspries, Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung   (1983), and an Honorary Doctorate from Notre Dame University (1986). During academic year 1987-88, she was President of The Aristotelian Society. Professor Anscombe has given endowed lectures at Stanford, Oxford, Cambridge, London, Harvard, Princeton, Minnesota, Johns Hopkins, Brown, UCLA, Columbia, Berkeley and other universities. Her translations of the writings of Ludwig Wittgenstein are widely viewed as important contributions to the study of his thought. (In addition to carrying out the translation of   Philosophical Investigations,   the only book by Wittgenstein published with his permission. As Wittgenstein's literary executor, she translated and co-edited his posthumous works.) Her original contributions to philosophy include the celebrated book   Intention   (1957) which launched the branch of philosophy known as "action theory,"   An Introduction to Wittgenstein's Tractatus   (1959),   Three Philosophers   (with P.T. Geach, 1961), and a three volume edition of her   Collected Papers   (Blackwell, 1981) a number of which (e.g., "The Intentionality of Sensation," "On Brute Facts," "Mr. Truman's Degree," "What's Wrong With Modern Moral Philosophy?," "The First Person," and "The Source of the Authority of the State") are widely regarded as classics of twentieth century philosophy. Her more recent contributions, apart from forthcoming Inaugural Lecture in Liechtenstein, include her penetrating chapter on "Murder and the Morality of Euthanasia," in   Euthanasia, Clinical Practice, and the Law  , (Luke Gormally, ed.) Linacre Centre, 1994. Her death in January of 2001 left bereft not only the world of philosophy, but also the world at large.

<p>  N  oam Chomsky, PhD 

<p> Noam Chomsky, PhD, member of the Program in Human Rights and Medicine Advisory Board, is an internationally renowned linguist, philosopher, political analyst, and outspoken critic of U.S. foreign policy and the mass media. A clue to his distinction and influence is provided by an interesting fact. According to the 1993 Arts and Humanities Citation Index, in the years 1980 through 1992, Noam Chomsky was cited as a source in arts and humanities journals and literature more often than any living scholar. Indeed, during the period studied, only seven writers in all of human history were cited more frequently than Noam Chomsky. (The seven included Shakespeare, Freud, Marx, the Bible, and Plato.) A clue to his modesty is provide by a recent episode. The fact just reported about the frequency with which his writings are cited was mentioned as he was being introduced at a public lecture at the University of Minnesota sponsored by the Program in Human Rights and Medicine. As he took the microphone, Chomsky said, with a smile, to the audience: "You have to be careful about statistics like the one just mentioned. The statistic doesn't tell you what those writers are saying about me."

<p>  Hymie Gordon, BSci, BM, BSurg, MD, FRCP 

<p> Hymie Gordon, MD, FRCP, was co-founder and Co-Chair of the Program in Human Rights and Medicine at the University of Minnesota, Professor Emeritus of Medical Genetics at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, and founder and director of the Mayo Clinic's world renowned program in medical genetics. Born in the Union of South Africa on 20 September 1926, he attended the University of Cape Town, where he earned the degree of Bachelor of Sciences in medical sciences in 1946, the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery in 1950 and the degree of Doctor of Medicine in 1958. The subject of his doctoral thesis was: "The Regulation of the Human Serum-Cholesterol Level."  

<p>He was an intern in the Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town in 1951, and in 1952 he was resident medical officer in the Stanger Government Hospital in Natal. He was medical registrar in the Addington Hospital in Durban, South Africa, from late 1952 to 1955. In 1955 and in 1956, he was senior medical registrar in the Groote Schuur Hospital, and from 1956 to 1958, he was clinical research bursar at the University of Cape Town. In 1958 and 1959 he was a fellow of the Forman Foundation and served as research associate in the Department of Cardiology at the Postgraduate Medical School and the Hammersmith Hospital in London, England. From 1959 to 1961, he was assistant physician in medicine and instructor in biostatistics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (in 1960 as an Eli Lilly foundation Fellow).  

<p>In 1961, he returned to South Africa, where he became senior lecturer in the Department of Medicine of the University of Cape Town and senior physician in the Groote Schuur Hospital. He established a genetics teaching and research program at the University of Cape Town and a Comprehensive Care Clinic at the Groote Schuur Hospital. He was the medical officer of the Students' Health and Welfare Centres Organization, Founder and Chairman of the Medical History Club, and President of the University Cricket Club.  

<p>He joined the Mayo Clinic on the 1st of May, 1969, and was charged with the task of developing a program in medical genetics. In January of 1972, he became the first chairman of the Department of Medical Genetics and the first Professor of Medical Genetics at the Mayo Medical School. In 1988, with G.E.M. Anscombe and John M Dolan, he founded the Program in Human Rights and Medicine at the University of Minnesota. With John M Dolan, from that date, he served as Co-Chair of the Program until his death.  

<p>He wrote numerous articles and contributed to numerous publications on clinical medicine, biochemistry, epidemiology, genetics, and medical history. He was often an invited lecturer at the leading centers of learning around the planet, including the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, the University of Padua, the Sorbonne in Paris, the Royal Postgraduate Medical School and most of the other London Medical Schools, and the University of Oxford. He was the David Hsia lecturer at Loyola Medical School, the Morris Fishbein Lecturer at the University of Chicago, the Kelly lecturer at Albany Medical School, the McKenzie Professor at the University of Edmonton, and the Benedict Lecturer at the American Academy of Ophthalmologists and Otorhinolaryngologists.  

<p>He was a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, the Royal College of Physicians of London, the Royal Society of Medicine, and the British Interplanetary Society; and he was a member of the Genetical Society of Great Britain. After emigrating to the United States of America in 1969, he was a member of the American society for Human Genetics, the American Association for the History of Medicine, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the Society of the Sigma-Xi. He served on the editorial boards of   Postgraduate Medicine   and of the   American Journal of Medical Genetics  . He was a member of the Medical Advisory Boards of the Committee for the Prevention of Jewish Genetic Diseases and of Human Life International. He was certified in Clinical Genetics by the American Board of Medical Genetics.  

<p>Dr. Gordon retired from Clinical practice in 1989 and, in the years afterward, devoted himself to three principal pursuits. First, he completed several research projects in genetics. Second, as Consultant in the History of Medicine, he composed and delivered a vast, sixty-lecture, three year lecture series titled, "History for Physicians," which covered illness, disease, medicine, and human culture from Biblical times up through the Human Genome Project. Third, as Co-Chair of the Program in Human Rights and Medicine, he spent thousands of hours planning, participating in, and leading seminars, lecture series, and other educational programs. A high point of his work with the Program in Human Rights and Medicine during those years was a highly successful six-lecture series of lectures he delivered at the University of Minnesota, in academic year 1993-94, titled "The Task of Medicine: A Rich Past and an Open Future." Throughout the years following his retirement from clinical practice, he continued his life-long habit of travel to the centers of learning and art in Europe, Israel, and his native South Africa. Dr. Gordon died during a visit to South Africa, on the 5th of February in 1995.

<p>  E  ulogy for Hymie Gordon, MD 

<p> (Delivered by John M. Dolan on 20 September 1995 at a memorial service held at the University of Minnesota on what would have been Dr. Gordon's 69th birthday. An earlier version of this eulogy was read by the author at a memorial service at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, on 23 March 1995)  

<p>It is a curious circumstance that I, the son of Christian parents, often think of a passage from The Koran when I think of Hymie Gordon, the son of a rabbi. The passage is this:  

<p>They shall question you concerning what they should  

<p> expend. Say "The abundance!" 

<p>  
 Hymie had an abundance undreamt of by most other men, and he spent it with exhilarating joy and generosity of spirit. Even his name held unsuspected riches.  

<p>Names sometimes encode remarkable historical information. It is well known that the name "Pluto" was given to the ninth planet because of its mythological appropriateness. Less well known is the fact that astronomers at the Lowell Observatory chose the name because its first two letters, "PL," are the initials of Percival Lowell, who played a central role in the search for the ninth planet.  

<p>You may have wondered how it came about that Hymie Gordon, a man of such aristocratic, even regal, bearing, was given the name, "Hymie," which sounds like a nickname. I never discussed the matter with him, but I think I know how it happened.  

<p>The name "Hymie" sounds like a nickname because it is a nickname, a diminutive of the Hebrew "Chaim," which means   life  . Before the first World War, when Lithuania was a territory of Russia, there was a law forbidding Jewish parents from giving their children full Biblical names. A family that wanted to name a son "Abraham" was forced to use a truncated version like "Abram." Parents who wanted to name a son "Chaim" had to use the diminutive "Hymie."  

<p>When Hymie Gordon was born in South Africa, his parents were free to give him any name they chose. I am convinced that they chose the name of a beloved departed family member who had been born in territory under the repressive Russian regime. If this is true, Hymie's name, like a tapestry containing a hidden figure, recalls   both   the repression under which his ancestors lived   and   the love and family loyalty by which his own family triumphed over that repression.  

<p>Quite apart from its historical and familial meanings, the name "Hymie" is stunningly appropriate for our dear friend.   Life indeed!   I have been blessed in my friendships, but I have never had a friend who lived more vibrantly and joyously than Hymie Gordon. Nor have I ever known a man who defended and cherished innocent human life more passionately and powerfully.  

<p>Nearly two decades ago, when he and I spoke on medical ethics at the then fledgling Mayo Medical School, a student asked Hymie Gordon a question about a topic already on its way to fashionability: death and dying. Hymie replied: "I am not interested in death. I do not study death. I am a doctor. I study life. My subject is life!" On the topic of living wills Hymie Gordon said: "We have no need for living wills. What we need is the will to live!" Concerning the prevalent use of the dehumanizing technical term "fetus" in current abortion debates he said: "I have been practicing medicine for more than forty years and have delivered babies on three continents and never once has a woman said to me 'Doctor, how is my fetus doing?'."  

<p>Hymie Gordon was appalled by the movement to enlist physicians in the deliberate destruction of human beings through abortion and euthanasia. With Professor Elizabeth Anscombe and me, he founded the Program in Human Rights and Medicine at the University of Minnesota, a program dedicated to the serious study of problems in medical ethics and to the free exchange of ideas concerning their solution. Over the past seven-and-a-half years, along with several of us in the room, he gave thousands of hours of his time to the Program.  

<p>A scrupulous attachment to fairness and the ideals of a university informed all his work in the Program and was conspicuously in evidence during the very last seminar over which he presided, just weeks before his death. The seminar was a presentation on assisted reproduction by a physician whose views on medical ethics were diametrically opposed to his own. So opposed that this physician casually referred to the selective aborting of multiple embryos as "dinking a pregnancy." Our aim that day was to learn the valuable clinical information the distinguished physician had to impart. Hymie Gordon uttered not a word in criticism of the cavalier references to abortion and treated our guest with cordial courtesy.  

<p>Henri Cartier-Bresson once wrote:  

<p>Photographing means recognizing in a single instant, a split second, both a fact, and the precise organization of visually perceived forms that embodies that fact. It means putting head, eye, and heart in one line of sight. 

<p>  
 That was Hymie Gordon exactly. Head, eye and heart in one line of sight. A superlative speaker sought after by universities, learned societies, and pro-life groups, he lectured at major centers of learning all over the planet. And his range of topics was as far flung as the venues at which he spoke. It was a dazzling experience to witness the orderly and rapid-fire marshaling of arguments by a mind whose store of knowledge ranged from Biblical archaeology to molecular biology. Bold, original, deeply learned, supremely self-confident, at times sharply polemical, always fresh and stimulating. Whether he was discussing the practices of the ancient Asclepiades or the Human Genome Project, his laser focus was the true Hippocratic end of medicine, the care and cherishing and protection of human life. Head, eye, and heart in one line of sight.  

<p>Brisk, daring, precise in utterance, dazzlingly articulate, possessed of a devilish wit, always elegantly attired, gracious, indeed, courtly in manner, always generous of heart, Hymie Gordon showered us with more gifts than we can easily recount. For example, after today, who at the Mayo Clinic will be able to name a new disease or coin some new scientific terminology without an uneasy sense of having perhaps committed a linguistic transgression which Hymie would have swiftly and cheerfully put right? Without hearing him say: "This is a barbarism! You're joining a Latin stem with a Greek suffix!"  

<p>A final word about our dear friend. He lectured as you all know with unparalleled and enthralling virtuosity. A small but significant episode illustrates the secret of his power as a lecturer and as a human being. A year ago, he delivered here a lecture that had been part of the magnificent, three-year, sixty-lecture cycle on medicine in history he had given at the Mayo Clinic. As anyone who heard the lecture on "Beethoven and Medical Practice in 19th Century Vienna" knows, it was powerful and profoundly moving. When he concluded, his audience of hundreds, which included scores of physicians, jumped up and delivered a thunderous ovation. Tears were streaming down the cheeks of more than a few people. A huge portrait of Beethoven was projected on the screen. Beethoven's majestic music could barely be heard over the thunderous applause. And Hymie Gordon stood with his back to the audience and applauded the enormous image of Beethoven. This was not a theatrical gesture. It told of the real power of his lectures. His wit, his astonishing verbal dexterity, his rapid-fire command of logic and fact, his capacity to instruct and amuse and delight were all subordinated to his subject. For Hymie Gordon, the subject, whether Beethoven's music or the structure of DNA, was the star.  

<p>Our dear friend, who carried so much of human civilization in his own person now rests in the ancient city of Jerusalem, which has been the vessel of so much of the spiritual grace of human civilization. The man who was a living embodiment of the consecration of learning now rests in one of the ancient centers of learning and wisdom. If he could give us counsel in our present grief he might borrow a poet's words and say that more important than the fact that our hearts are broken is the fact that we have hearts. He might teach us that the scars about to form on our hearts will speak of more than the painful wound we now suffer: they will attest to the power that heals our hearts, the power to which our beloved friend and brother, whose very name means life, devoted his entire life and soul.
