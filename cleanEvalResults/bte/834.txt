 Simply notify SLAC SCCS computing support by sending e-mail to   conference-comp@slac.stanford.edu   if you have an upcoming conference which may have computing needs, and we will contact you to discuss what is needed.  

<p>  It is important that conference-comp gets time to plan your needs with you and mobilize any resources necessary, so please do not hold off contacting us if you do not yet know the details. The checklist below is just a reference. If you have doubts as to whether your conference needs any computing resources, please just notify conference-comp anyways. 

<p>  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Computing at conferences and meetings can be complex, e.g., 

<p> projector set up with a computer (some need network access) 

<p> network access for laptops 

<p> printing for producing committee reports and papers 

<p> visitors not able to log onto SLAC computers to write reports (if conference is on site)  

<p> workstations needed for different purposes and different types of software 

<p> database access (databases residing on a server and accessed from web interface) 

<p> etc.  

<p>In order for you to plan and implement this properly at conferences, we need the sponsors of the conference to work with SCCS and other computing staff at SLAC. We need to plan and work with you on a sensible setup, so that for a temporary and mobile conference setup, you can obtain the desired functionality without having to replicate the complex SLAC infrastructure that you have come to expect at your SLAC office. 

<p>  Please go over this checklist and send e-mail to   conference-comp   list so that someone can contact you to discuss this. A secondary purpose of the checklist is to alert you of the complexities and guide you to think through the implementation in a timely manner. 

<p> SCCS and computing staff from other SLAC departments can provide consulting to plan the resources needed to meet your needs. To make your conference computing as easy as possible, you are urged to involve the computing staff in the planning from the beginning. The sponsors are responsible to find and fund the resources needed. 

<p>We would appreciate if past and future conference organizers will contribute to this web page to concentrate our experiences. Please send e-mail to   conference-comp  .

<p> When to do this  

<p>Initial planning between the SCCS contact and the conference computing contact 

<p>  Do this first.  &nbsp; This will allow you and the computing staff to:  

<p>identify the computing people responsible and the resources needed 

<p>understand what you expect for computing at the&nbsp; conference 

<p>what infrastructure to set up at the conference in coordination with other computing staff at SLAC 

<p>Contact   conference-comp  first, in order to involve SCCS and other computing staff. 

<p>N/A

<p> How many people will be bringing laptops? 

<p> How many laptop users will need internet access? 

<p> For those not bringing laptops, is e-mail, telnet and web browsing needed?

<p>Large number of PC hardware  

<p>How many workstations do you need? 

<p> Will the operating system and software need installing, and by whom? 

<p> Do you need to know the local workstation accounts (for NT/Linux)?

<p>contact   conference-comp 

<p>&nbsp; 

<p>&nbsp; 

<p> File interchange  

<p>For computers networked to the internet, files can be exchanged as e-mail attachments. Or FTP can be used on a&nbsp; common server.  

<p>For non-networked computers, make sure there is either floppy drive or other removable media. 

<p>PC's and Macs can exchange files via PC-formatted Zip cartridges (both will need Zip drives) or PC-formatted floppy disks.

<p>Has this person been given the local administrator or local root accounts for the workstations to have full privilege to configure? 

<p> Has this person been given CD's of all operating systems, service packs, software and printer drivers, printer and network cables to troubleshoot at conference site? 

<p>? 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p>Outsource to professional vendors 

<p>Professional vendors who provide conference registration, conference networking, conference computer setup   may be the most efficient way  . Few people realize the amount of complex work involved in setting up computing services for a big conference, and SLAC internal resources are limited and not optimized for this.  

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p> Testing the conference setup  

<p>What tests will be done?&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p> Will the tests be done in time to make changes? 

<p> Will tests&nbsp; involve verifying that network taps are active, projector, workstations, accounts to be used, software, printing, file transfer, file sharing, database (do tests need to include SLAC network, and disconnected from SLAC network)?
