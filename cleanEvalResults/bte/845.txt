 16 March 2002 : added a new link to a website where a glass bowl is placed over the famous 'toothpick in the microwave oven'. 

<p>  

<p>   Warning:  Everything on this page was actually tested in my own microwave oven and I encountered no dangerous situations. But... I make no guarantees what so ever for your experiments !!! Everything you experiment is at your own risk !!!  
   Never   misabuse your oven for these experiments for more than 10-20 seconds. After these 10-20 seconds you must let your oven cool down for a few minutes !!!  

<p> 

<p>    Below I will describe some nice things you can do with a microwave oven. Most effects are quite spectactular. When I first heard of it I didn't believe it until I actually tried it myself !  

<p> For these experiments it's best to use an old type of microwave oven. They are not so expensive for the case you actually blow it up ;-/ and they usually don't have a rotating plate so you can better see what happens.  

<p>  

<p>   Since I received quite some reactions and new tips about things to try but I have very little time to actually try them myself I will post the emails I received from some of you at   the bottom of this page  . 

<p> 

<p>  1. 

<p>Take an old   CD or CD-R   and put it in the oven, standing up. Put it against a glass cup or so. Don't use any metal as a holder. It will look like the image shown below. This image is a computer generated and rendered image from   Carl Licke   /   Turbid design   but the CD part in the middle is an actual taken picture. Notice the difference in the pattern that will show up in the metal layer in the CD between a normal silver CD and a green or gold or blue CD-R. Make sure you don't inhale the gas that comes out of the CD. It's not too good for your health, so they say ;-]  
   Note that the CD will be unusable afterwards ! 

<p>  

<p>   This is actually what you see when you put a CD in your microwave oven. 

<p> 

<p>   A closer look. 

<p> 

<p>  2. 

<p> Place a   wooden tooth pick   standing up in your oven and light the top so it burns slowly. I placed mine between the clip of a plastic pencil top. A cork will do fine too I guess. Matches instead of the tooth pick will also do but they will produce less spectacular effects. Now close the door and see what happens. You didn't expect that eh? Nice yellow / orange / green / blue fireballs going up from the stick. Uh,.... yes as you might suspect, your oven will become a bit black inside here and there. But I had no problems cleaning it up. Take care that the plastic inside your oven won't melt because of the burning stick (the plastic on the top of my oven hangs down a bit now ;-}. I also tried pieces of burning charcole and a burning piece of a beer-mat. Materials like that also work (they only need to glow, not nurn) but the tooth pick works best. The actual flame doesn't have to be big for good effects.  

<p>  

<p>   Fire balls like this one shoot up out of the tooth pick. 

<p> 

<p>   2 fire balls with a long shutter time. 

<p> 

<p>   1 very nice fire ball with a long shutter time. 

<p> 

<p>   1 fire ball with a long shutter time. 

<p> 

<p>  3. 

<p> The   light bulb   in the microwave oven. You can take an old one, it doesn't have to function anymore to give the desired effect. However, the glas has to be intact so the gas is still inside. I noticed that small bulbs won't work. I used a 230 V / 60 W one. Again you won't believe what you see ! All kinds of colors coming out of the bulb. But you should take care here. Sooner or later your bulb will explode. I tried mine for 10 seconds, let it cool down (probably not enough) then I tried it for another 10 seconds, let it cool down (probably not enough again) and then after 2 seconds after turning it on again it exploded inside the oven. The door of my oven was way thick enough, so all glass stayed inside. It's quite easy to clean up the glass and I don't think it will do much harm to your oven. However, my second lightbulb never exploded! The glas gets very hot but it won't blow up!  

<p> From 2 people I received the tip to put the bulb in a bowl of water in the microwave oven to cool it down so it won't explode. It works but the bulb might receive too little energy to light as brightly as it does without water around it.  

<p> I haven't tried small fluorescent lamps and flash bulbs from a photo flasher yet (because I don't have them) but I expect them to be very nice, too. If you try one, please let me know the results.  

<p>  

<p>   glowing light bulb (this is just a short sight; if you watch it for a few seconds you will see almost all possible colors. 

<p> 

<p>  4. 

<p> You got 3 minutes left? Maybe this experiment is one of the most useful ones listed here. Go visit   the Amnesty International   website, click &quot;take action&quot; and sign with your name and email address. If you also leave your phone number you will receive an SMS message every now and then to which you can reply, to sign a petition against torture. Thank you.  

<p>  

<p>  5. 

<p> For this experiment you need some   tinfoil  . I advise you to put an old glass plate or so on the bottom of your oven because the foil will get very hot. In fact, it gets so hot that it melted right into the glass plate that belongs to my oven... Now cut out a piece of about 22 x 1 cm and fold it like shown below. Wrap the two ends tight into each other.  

<p>  

<p> 

<p> Again, make sure not to turn on the oven for more than 10-20 seconds. Especially experiments with tinfoil will ask a lot of power from your oven and it might get hot, so let it cool down between your sessions or you might damage your oven.  

<p> I didn't get my eyes hurt but I don't think looking too much into the light is good for your eyes. I expected to have welding eyes in the evening but I was lucky. As with welding, a lot of UV light (you don't see light of this short wavelength) comes free which can damage your eyes.  

<p>  

<p>   Burning and crackling tinfoil. Put some old glass plate or so underneath it because it will melt the glass. 

<p> 

<p>  6. 

<p> In the U.S. used to be a program called "Mr. Wizard's World", in which this old guy would do all sorts of scientific nonsense... And one of the programs, he put a   flourescent   in the microwave... Although it sounds like fun, the results aren't really that exciting.. It just lights up, like a flourescent light is supposed to. Of course, this makes sense, since the material on the inside of the glass is there to turn the ultraviolet light into visible light in normal operation, and placing it in a microwave just makes this material act in its normal way, lighting up... (emailed by Michael Parker)  

<p>  
 I can tell you a bit how it works, I think. In a microwave there's no ultraviolet light. Just radio waves at 2.4 GHz. Normally the flourescent light will transmit ultraviolet light and the white powder will make this visible light. This happens because electrons of the atoms in the powder will get excited because of the exact amount of energy (or: the exact wavelength) they receive from the ultraviolet light. When (after a short while) these electrons fall back into their lower orbit, they also transmit light, but then in the visible range, but only 1 color. So they put several different kinds of atoms in the powder, that will transmit different colors so we will see white light. Appearently, in a microwave the gas in the tube gets energy from the microwave waves (probably because the gas is conducting) and starts transmitting ultraviolet light and the powder will transmit light. Easy.  

<p>  

<p>  7. 

<p> This one is a little less exciting, too, but it prodices a lot of light. I took a small old neon lamp (like the ones in swithes, electrician's screwdrivers etc.). They are ment for use at 60 to 90 Volts. Normally they are used with a large series resistor. For this you just need the glass lamp. I experimented a bit with it and it seems to go best if you twist the wires into eachother and put it in (again) tinfoil. If you do not put it in tinfoil, the ends of the wires will burn up and will shorten the wires. See the left picture.  

<p>  

<p>  This is how I did it. 

<p>  See how much light comes out of such a small lamp. Mine didn't explode, not even after 20 seconds ! 

<p> 

<p>  8. 

<p> Last week I demolished an old laserprinter. Most laserprinters and photo copiers have a lamp inside which is not there for the light but only for the warmth. Usually they are hudreths of watts and very long and thin and located inside the drum (a rubber roller). This is how mine looks like:  

<p>  

<p>  This is what the lamp looks like. 

<p> 

<p> So I thought, hey, why not put it in the microwave and see what happens (something a real fan of this page should think this too whenever he/she gets his/her hands on something that   might   do something funny inside of a microwave). Well, this is what it does:  

<p>  

<p>  It gives a bright light. 

<p> 

<p>  And later on the left end of the wire (lower left) starts to burn (inside the glass).  

<p> 

<p>  9. 

<p> My former student flat fellows discovered the Christmas tree ornament in the microwave ! It's pretty much like a CD but then it's not flat but a 3D glowing ball. Simon Oosthoek made this picture with his new digital camera: 

<p>  

<p>  Christmas tree ornament in the microwave, a beauty, isn't it? 

<p> 

<p>  10. 

<p> A former student flat fellow (Simon Oosthoek) tried a small TL tube in the microwave and it looks nice:  

<p>  

<p>   This is what the setup looks like. 

<p> 

<p>   And this shows how nice it burns :-) 

<p> 

<p>  11. 

<p> A lot of people wrote me to put a bar of soap in the microwave. And I did :-) After 3 minutes the thing was about 5 times it's original size!  

<p>  

<p>   This is what the several &quot;  larval stages  &quot; look like. 

<p> 

<p>  12. 

<p> I finally saw a movie of The Egg In The Microwave :-) You can see it at   on the swedish telvision show called Wimans  .  

<p>  

<p>  13. 

<p> Hm.... nr 13. I know that marshmallows in a microwave must be nice to see. They swallow up like the bar of soap. I will be making pictures soon.  

<p>  

<p>  14. 

<p> Simon told me that there is a show in Swden, ironically called &quot;Wimans&quot;. Here they have a movie of   The Exploding Egg   !!!. It's at   http://130.244.202.52/ztv/wimans/pallefiles/eggmikro.mpg   (or   a local copy  ). See the emails below.  

<p>  

<p>  15. 

<p> Altough I am very much against nuking animals, even if they're flies or Gerbils this one is very funy :-)   See for yourself  !  

<p>  

<p>  16. 

<p> This is much better than throwing away those broken bulbs, eh? These photographs were sent in by   Dianne M Anderson  . She even made a   movie   of it!  

<p>  

<p>   This is what a blown out bulb looks like. 

<p> 

<p>  17. 

<p> This is guy has a very nice extra to the 'toothpick in the microwave' (see nr 2 above). The only thing he does extra is putting a glass bowl over the toothpick. He sees a very bright flash when it starts and then the plasma is much more stable than without the bowl. Have a look at   Jean-Louis Naudin's page   ! He has many pictures and movies too.  

<p> 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> 

<p>    Emails I received with usefull tips (I didn't try them myself yet).  

<p>We just found a new one... 

<p> Putting a foil lined snack size chip bag in the microwave is pretty cool, turning it inside out is also cool. 

<p> What would a 1/4&quot; slice of an aluminum pop can do? 

<p> In light of the grape trick what would two adjacent pennies or dimes do? 

<p> Garland and tinsel (the current plasic kind, not the old metalic kind) just shrink, smoke, and really stink, don't try it.

<p>Grapes of wrath 

<p>  
 Cut a grape in half. Not all the way, just leave a little skin between the two halves. Place the cut grape on a plate - round sides down, flat (cut) side up, still attached or just touching if severed. Start the microwave. You will not believe the arcs and plasma you can get out of a little grape. This trick does not always work, but one out of 10-15 gripe gives a spectacular show. We have cut them top to bottom and side to side, both ways works. We have tried large green seedless grapes and smaller purple grapes, the smaller ones tend to perform better. We also notice that there is some correlation between their angle in the microwave and the arcing. We believe the effect to be the two halves of the grape acting as resonant chambers for the microwave radiation and the arcing to perhaps be due to the difference in charge between the grape hemispheres. If this is correct the effect should be most spectacular when the grape halves are aligned with the microwave source.

<p>Hey! 

<p> I really enjoyed your &quot;alternative uses&quot for the ol' microwave. I have one which you may want to try also. Place a small loosely wadded ball of steel wool padding (as used for metal polishing or wood finishing) into the microwave, cook on high power for a few seconds.

<p>  

<p>You take one ordinary woodenpencile, place it in your oven. Turn your oven on, and wait. You will not get a immediate effect but after a while the pencile will like explode. 

<p> If you know a little about electrisity, and the effect of sending it thru a woodenpencile whith graphite, then you might know what to expect. 

<p> If you want a explanation why the pencile do what it does

<p>Hi! 

<p>  
 I liked that about the microwave ovens very much, and I just feel that I must add something about it. This is a very interesting experiment but I certainly hope that you will never get in position to try it. :-) I'm from Yugoslavia and I supposed that you know very well what was happening here a year ago. Well I have some friends from the army and they learned me the new application for microwave ovens. It is not widely known that the regular microwave ovens use the same wavelength as most of the air-defense radar. So what we did was (it is no longer classified :-) only adjusting the regular microwave to work with it's door opened somewhere under the open sky. I'm not sure, but we were probably using just long cables connected with standard 220V~ output as a power supplies. And what was happening: if that bastard pilot (no offense to you since I can see that you are from The Netherlands :-) doesn't have a visual contact he can only say that radar is tracking him. So he launches the anti-radar missile and - he wastes a several hundred thousand $ missile for a price of one microwave oven. We literaly used hundreds of such decoys - often planting tens of decoys with one REAL radar. And if the pilot is lucky enough to hit the actual radar, then everything is O.K. for him. But there are much bigger chances that he will hit a decoy instead, and after that he gets what he deserves from the actual radar. That's the story. What do you say? A total new application for an MW oven! :-)

<p>Hi! 

<p>  
 I really like your microwave oven page. If you put some pieces of magnesium shavings in your microwave and turn it on, it burns really bright and sends some fireballs out of it.

<p>  

<p>  Jeroen Domburg   mailed me to tell that flash bulbs don't do much. They get hot but won't light up. He suggests that the voltage needed to light the bulb is a few kilo Volts and the microwave won't produce that much (I doubt that). 

<p> He also confirms what I already tried that a LED won't do much eighter (just lights a little).  

<p> 

<p>  

<p>I loved your microwave oven page so much that I just had to add something. If you have the flat bottom microwave then try this. Take some vegtable oil and grease the bottom of the microwave, then take some grapes prefeably seedles, and line them up at one end of the microwave with the holes pointing towads the wall they are lined up againsed. Turn the microwave on and see which one gets the farthest or gets to the other side fastest. Sometimes the grape will just explode but that just adds to the fun. You can make bets with your friends if you want.

<p>Hey. I saw your fun with microwaves page. I just want to say that if you fill a glass half full with water, and then put a lightbulb in that metal down it won't get that hot, and you can leave it in there longer. The other thing is, and I have not tried it yet, but get an egg, put it in a microwave, turn it on, and run. I have heard it will blow the door off your microwave.

<p>Hi I saw your webpage and had to add something I like you am fascinated with Microwaves and I like seeing what happens to things when placed in a microwave! A few days ago at school we decided to put a rasin in a microwave in the cookery room cos we had been told it would explode by one of our friends Ben BUT....it didn't what it did do was expand to about twice the size it first was, then it went on fire causing a terrible smell to waft around the school!! luckily we did this experiment at break time so none of the teachers knew who had done it I am soo glad we didn't do it during our actual cookery class our teacher would have gone ape shit!

<p>  

<p>A comment on your experiments: 

<p> 
Items such as the Neon Light don't need to be attached to aluminum foil. What you need is Metal (antenna) inside "inert gas" or "gas". The metal picks up the microwave energy, but because of the wavelength of micro-waves, there is a voltage potential between the parts of metal. 

<p> 
The arcing betwen 2 points of metal / grape-halfs / etc is caused by the difference in the voltage potential causing the arking.  

<p> 
Neon Lights will work for a long time and not get as hot if you cut the metal leads off of the bulb. The metal inside the bulb will still act as an antenna, and the gas will still get excited / glow. 

<p> 
I would think that a "Strobe Light" bulb would product brilliant white light. Phosphorus will glow brilliantly when excited. This is what causes the flourescent light to glow (phosphorus on the inside of the glass) I would not recommend sticking flourescent lights in the microwave though, since they contain mercury. You don't want mercury inside your microwave since it will turn into a gas and get onto your food. I have heard that Pickle's glow, but I think that's just arcing through the salt-water inside the pickle since the salt makes it conductive. 

<p> 
I wonder if the "Indiglo" part of an old watch would glow. I think they are phosphorus based, so they should (if they don't burn)  

<p>

<p>Love your microwave fun page. Not sure if this is fun because it scared the shit out of me. Me and some friends were high once and we decided to go to the cliffs to eat. We wanted some soup there so we got one of those ice-pack things and stuck it in the microwave. We had it on high and set it for a few minutes. By the way this was one of those nice ones that are thick plastic. Anyways after about a half minute the thing exploded and blew the door litterally off the microwave. So this is only cool to do if you are destroying a microwave.  

<p>  
 Kevin Presa 

<p> kpresa@chesapeake.net 

<p> 
   This is a follow-up to the guy who put an ice-pack in the microwave. I would highly recommend against doing that again, as the ingredient that lowers the temperature is ammonium nitrate--a high order explosive. I'm surprised that he didn't kill himself. 

<p> 

<p>Try this one. Get a polaroid camera. Take a picture of something. Then quickly put it into the microwave for only a couple of seconds. The sparks will fly.Then take the picture out and check out the amazing colors that are produced.Try putting a drop of water on the picture and you will get some control over the burn. You will amaze your friends and have fun for hours! Another wonderful experiment.

<p>Also if you place two peeps (those yellow marshmallow easter candy things shaped like baby chicks) in the microwave facing each other, and stick two toothpicks in them, when you turn it on, the inflate and stab each other . . . peep jousting!

<p>Hi! 

<p>  
 There is a show here in Swden, ironically called "Wimans" that broadcasts on the channel ZTV. They make lot of different experiments. One of them is an egg in the micro. You requested a movie like that.. Hope this one will do. 

<p>   http://130.244.202.52/ztv/wimans/pallefiles/eggmikro.mpg   (or   a local copy  )

<p> Sincerely /simonize 

<p> 

<p>  

<p>Very cool page. 

<p>  
 A couple years ago I was reading up on ball lightning, and I found an article on producing it in microwave ovens. The effect is similar to the burning toothpick, but it can last for several minutes if a lit candle is used. Every couple of seconds, the flame will flare up, and sometimes a small fireball will detach itself, float to the ceiling of the oven, and persist for several seconds. It's a spectacle, and it's probably safe -- but no guarantee (Do remember to check the candle for a metal base! (Yes, remove it.)). 

<p>  
 I tried this once. The 3&quot; candle got warm and burnt down in about 5 minutes. Aside from molten wax on the floor, there was no visible damage or staining inside the microwave, and it seemed to operate normally afterwards.  

<p>  
 I am not a tree (? :-)

<p> 

<p>  

<p>Seeing as how you are a microwave oven guru, I would like to ask a question. If you do not know the answer, maybe you would pass this along to any of your microwave oven cohorts. 

<p>  
 Q: If a manetron is removed from an oven and mounted so that the beam is projected in a horizontal manner, and a glass lens is mounted in the direction that the beam is projected so as to focus it, would it be possible to focus the beam on a distant object in order to heat it? 

<p>  

<p>A:   I even have a remark placed on my page about this. 

<p>  
 First, the "beam" has an angle of almost 180 degrees so it will go all directions. 

<p>  
 Second, if this beam hits you it will do great damage to your body. If it hits your eyes you will go blind. This would be one of the first things that happens.   Jeff Holmes   added: The first thing is you can forget about having children because you will be sterile.  

<p>  
 Third, you cannot focus a microwave beam by a glass lens A glass lens is only suitable for electro magnetic waves in the visible frequency range. I don't know how to focus beams of 2.4 GHz. 

<p>  
 I would most certainly not do an experiment as you describe, really !  

<p>

<p> we-man@home.nl 

<p> 

<p>  

<p>A real nice technical explanation from Simon Wilson. A bit too long for here so I made   a separate page   of it. 

<p> 

<p>  

<p>Ever look at the inside of a potato chip bag (like Lays or Doritos)? Notice the silver coating on the inside? Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Oh yes, and what a show. Almost as much sparking as a CD, all throughout the bag. And when it's over, the bag is actually miniaturized, you can still read the print and everything but it's TINY! Be careful, if you do this for too long the plastic gets overheaded and bubbles form and it kind of ruins it. 2-4 seconds should be enough for most modern medium-to-high powered microwaves. We melted one of each brand of bag from the vending machine at a store i used to work at and stuck them to the wall in a big collage while they where still hot! :-D Have fun! 

<p>  
 P.S. Eat the chips first, otherwise it gets messy ;-)

<p>  

<p>I enjoyed your microwave page - glad to see it survived being slashdotted! 

<p>  
 I discovered this weekend that if you use your microwave to defrost a frozen chilli, two things happen: 

<p> 1) It flares up, much as you've described a toothpick flaring up, in pink and yellow; 

<p> 2) Your flatmate runs across the kitchen, shouting 'Make it stop!' 

<p>  
 Both rather amusing. If you want to recreate this effect, I should add that we used a smallish red chilli; it's possible that other types of chillies would produce other colours/effects. 

<p>  
 Cheers, 
   Gareth Evans 

<p> 

<p>  

<p>Tried this one in Jr. High Home Ec. class. 

<p>  
 Put a handful of straight pins (the kind with the colored plastic heads)(jumbled up, NOT neatly stacked) into the microwave. I reccomend putting them on a glass plate because this will make a mess. Turn on the microwave and watch the fireworks and the plastic heads melting! Sparks shoot out of the pins(this is why you want them jumbled up, so the sparks will go in all different directions) 

<p>  
 We did this between classes. After that, there was always a colored lump in the middle of the microwave (we didn't use a plate).

   Well, that's all for now folkes! As soon as I think of new experiments I'll let you know. Again, be carefull with these experiments and please let me know about them. I'm sure you can think of a lot of other nice tricks, so please email them to   me  .

<p>   READ THIS:   There used to be an email in here of someone who said he took the transmitter out of his moicrowave oven and then turned it on. This is really (and if   I   say really I do mean really :-) dangerous ! The radiation is coming out to almost the entire 180 degrees angle and it will almost sure hit your body with all negative consequences.... The first thing which will happen is that you go blind..... So don't do that ! -Over and out-
