 The Mad Genius from the Bottom of the Sea  From the article: 

<p>Craven's system exploits the dramatic temperature difference between ocean water below 3,000 feet - perpetually just above freezing - and the much warmer water and air above it. That temperature gap can be harnessed to create a nearly unlimited supply of energy. Although the scientific concepts behind cold-water energy have been around for decades, Craven made them real when he founded the state-funded Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii in 1974 on Keahole Point, near Kona. Under Craven, the lab developed the process of using cold deep-ocean water and hot surface water to produce electricity. By the 1980s the Natural Energy Lab's demonstration plant was generating net power, the world's first through so-called ocean thermal energy conversion.   "The potential of OTEC is great," says Joseph Huang, a senior scientist for the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration and an expert on the process. "The oceans are the biggest solar collector on Earth, and there's enough energy in them to supply a thousand times the world's needs. If you want to depend on nature, the oceans are the only energy source big enough to tap."  

<p>"Enough energy to supply a thousand times the world's needs" sounds like a lot of energy. It also sounds like the end of the   fossil fuel economy  .

<p>    OTEC has been in the news since dinosaurs roamed the earth, or so it seems sometimes.&nbsp; I recall seeing it on the cover of Popular Science no later than the 80's, more likely in the 70's. 

<p> 
Experiments have been running for the last two decades or so.&nbsp; None has yielded the breakthrough which would lead to widespread adoption, and I doubt anything can. 

<p> 
-&nbsp; The capital costs of large cold-water pipes aren't easily brought down. 

<p>-&nbsp; Sites with cold, deep water available close to shore don't seem to be where power is wanted very often. 

<p>-&nbsp; OTEC power doesn't pay for itself; it needs other products (fresh water, cooling) to make the venture pay.&nbsp; Getting all of those things together compounds the difficulty. 

<p>-&nbsp; The rarity of sites which can profitably exploit OTEC means little investment money, so the economies of scale have never been available. 

<p> 
It seems that OTEC pops into the news every time energy issues make it into the popular consciousness.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it may be the perpetual also-ran to technologies with wider geographic possibilities, more rapid cost reductions and better prospects for improvement.&nbsp; Solar PV is going to go a lot further than OTEC.

<p>    I did not realise that blogs could be so informative. I have browsing and reading all day -- Very addictive.  

<p> 
I am going to set up a blog for my own site   make big money   tomorrow! I have a lot to of information to share. The link to read should be  

<p>live soon. If you have an interest in make big money I would love to hear what you think of my site :-)
