 all lyrics written by Kate Bush  

<p> 

<p> 

<p> Out on the wiley, windy moors 

<p>We'd roll and fall in green 

<p>You had a temper, like my jealousy 

<p>Too hot, too greedy 

<p>How could you leave me? 

<p>When I needed to possess you 

<p>I hated you, I loved you too 

<p> 
Bad dreams in the night 

<p>They told me I was going to lose the fight 

<p>Leave behind my wuthering, wuthering 

<p>Wuthering Heights 

<p>  
 Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy come home 

<p>I'm so cold, let me in-a-your window  

<p> 
Oh it gets dark, it gets lonely 

<p>On the other side from you 

<p>I pine a lot, I find the lot 

<p>Falls through without you 

<p>I'm coming back love, cruel Heathcliff 

<p>My one dream, my only master 

<p> 
Too long I roam in the night 

<p>I'm coming back to his side to put it right 

<p>I'm coming home to wuthering, wuthering 

<p>Wuthering Heights 

<p> 
Oh let me have it, let me grab your soul away 

<p>Oh let me have it, let me grab your soul away 

<p>You know it's me, Cathy 

<p>   Kate Bush's   "Wuthering Heights" 

<p>(her first hit in 1978) 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> How I'm moved, how you move me 

<p>With your beauty's potency 

<p>You give me life, please don't let me go 

<p>You crush the lily in my soul 

<p>  from "Moving" 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> The candle burning over your shoulder 

<p>Is throwing shadows from your saxophone 

<p>A surly lady in tremor 

<p>The stars that climb from her bowels  

<p>Those stars make towers on vowels 

<p>You'll never know that you had all of me 

<p>You'll never see the poetry you've stirred in me 

<p>Of all the stars I've seen that shine so brightly 

<p>I've never known or felt, in myself, so rightly 

<p>  from "Saxophone Song" 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> Soul birds of a feather flock together 

<p>  from "Strange Phenomena" 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> And then I find out, when I take a good look up 

<p>There's a hole in the sky with a big eyeball 

<p>Calling me 

<p> 
I got no limbs 

<p>I'm like a feather on the wind 

<p>Well I'm not sure if I want to be up here at all 

<p>And I'd like to be back on the ground 

<p>But I don't know how to get down 

<p>  from "Kite" 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> I hear him before I go to sleep 

<p>And focus on the day that's been 

<p>I realise he's there when I turn the light off 

<p>And turn over 

<p>Nobody knows about my man 

<p>They think he's lost on some horizon 

<p>And suddenly I find myself 

<p>Listening to a man I've never known before 

<p>Telling me about the sea 

<p>All his love, 'till eternity 

<p>  from "The Man With The Child In His Eyes" 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> All the colours look brighter now 

<p>Everything they say seems to sound new  

<p>Slipping into tomorrow too quick 

<p>Yesterday always too good to forget 

<p>Stop the swing of the pendulum, let us through! 

<p>  from "Oh To Be In Love" 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> You came out of the night 

<p>Wearing a mask in white colour 

<p>My eyes were shining on the wine 

<p>And your aura 

<p> 
The thoughts of you sends me shivery 

<p>I'm dressed in lace sailing down a black reverie 

<p>  from "L'Amour Looks Something Like You" 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> I must work on my mind 

<p>For now I realize that everyone of us 

<p>Has a heaven inside 

<p> 
They open doorways that I thought were shut for good 

<p>They read me Gurdjieff and Jesu 

<p>They build up my body 

<p>Break me emotionally, it's nearly killing me 

<p>But what a lovely feeling! 

<p>I love the whirling of the Dervishes 

<p>I love the beauty of rare innocence 

<p>You don't need no crystal ball 

<p>Don't fall for a magic wand 

<p>We humans got it all 

<p>We perform the miracles 

<p>  from "Them Heavy People" 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> Lost in your men and the games you play 

<p>Trying to prove that you're better, woman 

<p>But you needn't get heavy with them 

<p>Like it or not, we were build tough 

<p>Because we're woman 

<p> 
No, we never die for long 

<p> While we've got that little life to live for 

<p>Where it's hid inside, no, we never die for long 

<p>Oh-woman, two in one 

<p>There's room for a life in your womb, woman 

<p>Inside of you, can be two, woman 

<p>  from "Room For The Life" 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> I've pulled down my lace and the chintz 

<p>Oh, do you know you have the face of a genius 

<p>I'll send your love to Zeus 

<p>Oh, by the time you read this 

<p>I'll be well in touch 

<p> 
I'm giving it all in a moment or two 

<p>I'm giving it all in a moment for you 

<p>I'm giving it all 

<p>Giving it, giving it, giving it 

<p>This kicking here inside makes me leave you behind 

<p>No more under the quilt to keep you warm 

<p>Your sister I was born, you must lose me 

<p>Like an arrow shot in the killer storm 

<p> 
You and me on the bobbing knee 

<p>Didn't we cry at that old mythology he'd read 

<p>I will come home again, but not until 

<p>The sun and moon meet on yon hill 

<p>  "The Kick Inside" 

<p>(really beautiful song .... about incest 

<p>I admire Kate's lyrical courage, and talent) 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> I spend a lot of my time looking at blue 

<p>The colour of my room and my mood 

<p>Blue on the walls 

<p>Blue out of my mouth 

<p>The sort of blue 

<p>Between clouds when the sun comes out 

<p>The sort of blue 

<p>In those eyes you get hung up about 

<p> 
The more I think about sex 

<p>The better it gets 

<p>Here we have a purpose in life 

<p>Good for the blood circulation 

<p>Good for releasing the tension 

<p>The root of our reincarnations 

<p>  from "Symphony In Blue" 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> I've been told 

<p>When I get older 

<p>That I'll understand it all 

<p>But I'm not sure if I want to 

<p>  from "In Search Of Peter Pan" 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> When the actor reaches his death 

<p>You know it's not for real 

<p>He just holds his breath 

<p>But he always dives too soon 

<p>Too fast to save himself 

<p>He'll never make the screen 

<p>He'll never make "The Sweeney" 

<p> Be that movie queen 

<p>He's too busy hitting the vaseline 

<p>  from "Wow" 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> In the warm room 

<p>Her perfume reaches you 

<p>Eventually you'll fall for her 

<p>Down you'll go to where the mellow wallows 

<p> 
In the warm room 

<p>You'll fall into her like a pillow 

<p>Her thighs are soft as marshallows 

<p>Say hello to the soft mush of her hollows 

<p>  from "In The Warm Room" 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> She wanted to test her husband 

<p>She knew exactly what to do 

<p>A pseudonym to fool him 

<p>She couldn't have made a worse move 

<p>She sent him scented letters 

<p>And he received them with a strange delight 

<p>Just like his wife 

<p>But how she was before the tears 

<p>And how she was before the years flew by 

<p>And how she was when she was beautiful 

<p>She signed the letter 

<p> 
All yours, Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya 

<p> 
She wanted to take it further 

<p>So she arranged a place to go 

<p>To see if he 

<p>Would fall for her incognito 

<p>And when he laid eyes on her 

<p>He got the feeling they had met before 

<p>Uncanny how she 

<p>Reminds him of his little lady 

<p>Capacity to give him all he needs 

<p>Just like his wife before she freezed on him 

<p>Just like his wife when she was beautiful 

<p>He shouted out, I'm... 

<p> 
All yours, Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya  

<p>  "Babooshka" 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> One of the band told me last night 

<p>That music is all that he's got in his life 

<p>So where does it go 

<p>Surely not with his soul 

<p>Will all of his licks and his R & B blow away 

<p>  from "Blow Away" 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> The whims that we're weeping for 

<p>Our parents would be beaten for 

<p>Leave the breast and then the nest 

<p>And then regret you ever left 

<p>  from "All We Ever Look For" 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> Our little Army boy 

<p>Is coming home from B.F.P.O. 

<p>I've a bunch of purple flowers 

<p>To decorate a mammy's hero 

<p>Mourning in the aerodrome 

<p>The weather warmer, he is colder 

<p>Four men in uniform to carry home 

<p>My little soldier 

<p> 
What could he do? Should have been a rock star 

<p>But he didn't have the money for a guitar 

<p>What could he do? Should have been a politician 

<p>But he never had a proper education 

<p>What could he do? Should have been a father 

<p>But he never even made it to his twenties 

<p>What a waste 

<p>Army Dreamers 

<p> 
Tears o'er a tin box 

<p>Oh Jesus Christ, he wasn't to know 

<p>Like a chicken with a fox 

<p>He cannot win the war with ego 

<p>Give the kid the pick of pips 

<p>And give him all your stripes and ribbons 

<p>Now he's sitting in his hole 

<p>He might as well have ribbons and bows 

<p>  "Army Dreamers" 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> December will be magic again 

<p>Light up the candlelights 

<p>To conjure Mr. Wilde 

<p>Into the silent night 

<p>Ooh, it's quiet inside 

<p>Here in Oscar's mind 

<p>  from "December Will Be Magic Again" 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> I've been doing it for years 

<p>My goal is moving near 

<p>It says "Look I'm over here" 

<p>Then it up and disappears 

<p>  from "Sat In Your Lap" 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> My door was never locked 

<p>Until one day a trigger come - cocking 

<p>  
 Narrow mind would persecute it 

<p>Die a little to get to it 

<p> 
I kept it in a cage 

<p>Watched it weeping, but I made it stay 

<p> 
We let the weirdness in 

<p>  from "Leave It Open" 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> With a hired plane 

<p>And no names mentioned 

<p>Tonight's the night of the flight 

<p>Before you know 

<p>I'll be over the water like a swallow 

<p>There's no risk 

<p>I'll whisk them up 

<p>In no moonlight 

<p>And though pigs can fly 

<p>They'll never find me 

<p>Posing as the night 

<p>And I'm home before the morning 

<p> 
In Malta catch a swallow 

<p>For all of the guilty to let them free 

<p>Wings fill the window 

<p>And they beat and bleed 

<p>They hold the sky 

<p>On the other side 

<p>Of border lines 

<p>  
 Give me a break 

<p>Ooh let me fly 

<p>Give me something to show 

<p>For my miserable life 

<p>Give me something to take 

<p>Would you break even my wings 

<p>Just like a swallow 

<p>Let me, let me go 

<p>  from "Night Of The Swallow" 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> The first time I died 

<p>Was in the arms of good friends of mine 

<p>They kiss me with tears 

<p>They hadn't been near me for years 

<p>Say why do it now 

<p>When I won't be around, I'm going out 

<p>  from "All The Love" 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> You're like my yo-yo 

<p>That glowed in the dark 

<p>What made it special 

<p> Made it dangerous 

<p>So I bury it and forget 

<p> 
Everytime it rains 

<p> You're here in my head 

<p>Like the sun coming out 

<p>Ooh I just know that something good is going to happen 

<p>And I don't know when 

<p>But just saying it could even make it happen 

<p>  from "Cloudbusting" 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> It's wonderful 

<p>Everything so white 

<p>The river has frozen over 

<p>Not a soul on the ice 

<p>Only me skating fast 

<p>I'm speeding past trees leaving 

<p>Little lines in the ice 

<p>Cutting out little lines 

<p>In the ice  

<p>Splitting, splitting sound 

<p>Silver heels spitting, spitting snow 

<p>There's something moving under 

<p>Under the ice 

<p>Moving under ice 

<p>Through water 

<p>Trying to get out of the cold water 

<p>"It's me" 

<p> Something, someone 

<p>Help them 

<p>"It's me" 

<p>  "Under Ice" 

<p>(from "The Ninth Wave", the concept side of the album "Hounds Of Love" 

<p>the woman is in the river, near drowning, trying to stay awake) 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> This moment in time 

<p>It doesn't belong to you 

<p>It belongs to me 

<p>And to your little boy and your little girl 

<p>And the one hand clapping 

<p>Where on your palm is my little line 

<p>When you're written in mine 

<p>As an old memory 

<p>  from "Jig Of Life" 

<p>(another part of "The Ninth Wave" 

<p>in a dream, the woman sees her older self 

<p>this is the older version talking to her 

<p>man, I love this woman's lyrics!) 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> Just being alive 

<p>It can really hurt 

<p>And these moments given 

<p>Are a gift from time 

<p>  from "Moments Of Pleasure" 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> See how the flower leans instinctively toward the light 

<p>See how the heart reaches out instinctively 

<p>For no reason but to touch 

<p>  from "Reaching Out" 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> They say that the Devil is a charming man 

<p>And just like you I bet he can dance 

<p>  from "Heads We're Dancing" 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> As the people here grow colder 

<p>I turn to my computer 

<p>And spend my evenings with it 

<p>Like a friend 

<p>  from "Deeper Understanding" 

<p> 

<p> 

<p> I know you have a little life in you yet 

<p>I know you have a lot of strength left 

<p> 
I should be crying 

<p>But I just can't let it show 

<p> I should be hoping 

<p>But I can't stop thinking 

<p>Of all the things we should've said 

<p>That were never said 

<p>All the things we should've done 

<p>That we never did 

<p>All the things that you needed from me 

<p>All the things that you wanted for me 

<p>All the things that I should've given 

<p>But I didn't 

<p>  from "This Woman's Work"
