<p>The headline says it all:   Lapse at Melbourne   IT   Enabled Panix.com Hijacking  . 

<p> Welcome to Making Light's comments section. Moderator: Teresa Nielsen Hayden. 

<p> Comments on   Aha!: 

<p>   #1  :::  Richard Parker  :::  (view all by)  :::  January 19, 2005, 12:09 AM  : 

<p>InternetNews.com has an article   Panix.com Hijacking Causes Panic   that includes some additional details. It appears that while there was indeed a failure at Melburne IT, Panix may well be not entirely blameless.  

<p>According to a couple of articles, including the Netcraft   article  , Panix officials insist that the panix.com domain had been registrar locked at the time of the hijack. However, George DeCarlo, vice president of marketing at Dotster (Panix's registrar), is reported in the InternetNews.com article as saying that Panix did not sign onto Dotster's domain-locking service. According to at least one knowledgeable poster on NANOG, the panix.com domain, as of a month ago, was not locked. The fact that the domain wasn't locked doesn't absolve Melburne IT of failing to adequately authenticate a transfer request, but it does indicate that Panix may not have been as careful as they should have been.

<p>Nice piece at EWeek (successor to PC Week http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1751981,00.asp )  .....Have the new rules already failed, or have the registrars failed their customers?....  

<p>Reports are several domains were redirected. One source says "Almost 500,000 unique visitors were diverted yesterday to spyware" 

<p>Any thoughts from the international crowd about title and registry as systems for confirming ownership of intangibles cf. systems for land title?  

<p>A public audit trail for ownership and hosting transfers sounds nice. The registries auctioning expired and soon to expire domains just might put a registry in some conflict with its clients? 

<p>I expect spam offering domain title insurance real soon now.

<p>Without disputing their designation as "for-real criminals," it would be quite foolish to pay for such an operation using   your own   credit line, and computer crackers have at least as much access to card numbers as people who are used to stealing actual physical money. 

<p>  It wasn't that Dortmunder didn't like computers. You could fence them at the same discount as fur coats or DVD recorders, and a considerably better rate than large pieces of jewelry with names. What he found troubling was the unreality of computer money. Once upon a time, you robbed a store, or if you were large-minded, a bank, and you had a bag with paper in it. Everybody liked the paper, and took it happily. (One of Dortmunder's girlfriends called it "fungibility." The relationship didn't last long after that.) But the important thing was, you knew when you had the paper, you could put it in a box and open up the box to make sure it was still there. Somebody might steal the box -- it happened all the time -- but there were things to do about that, not all of them involving blunt instruments. The computer was a box, but you not only couldn't look inside it to see if the money was there, if the money wasn't there, nobody could tell Dortmunder exactly where it might have gone, or if it even still existed. The U.S. Government had a pretty good set of rules for replacing money that had unfortunately gotten a little burned or had to have unpleasant substances scrubbed off it. They were pretty nice about doing that, for the government. That didn't seem to be true with computer money. It was kind of like knocking over a jewelry store to steal the pretty reflections.

<p>Dotster isn't claiming that it's all Panix's fault. The procedure for   transferring *unlocked* domains involves notifying the customer and   the original registrar. That didn't happen. (The procedure for   transferring locked domains is "unlock it first", which also involves   notifications.) 

<p>(My understanding is second hand, culled from a weekend of reading   panix.questions. Please correct me if I'm wrong.)

<p>Ah, I fondly remember the silly monsters our local DMs came up with: the Fire-Breathing Hobbit, the Molotov Cocktroll (a troll that explodes when you kill it)...I'm not sure if the Finger-Joint Shooting Skeletons were original, but I'm pretty sure the Toe-Joint version was; they were called MissleToes. 

<p>Then there was the Wing, which was nothing but a great big...wing. It wasn't particularly dangerous, but it was completely indestructible, so there was no way to kill it for Experience Points. An example of a TWP, or Time Wasting Pimp. 

<p>They were always creating some silly variation that wasn't as dangerous or valuable, so that the players would waste time being careful and trying to kill the thing, instead of ignoring it. One more example: there was a standard critter called an Umber Hulk, which had some kind of mindcontrol spell, I don't remember what. My local DMs invented the Lumber Hulk, which had Control Plants.  

<p>OK, time to stop. Fond memories triggered, that's all.

<p>Theft of intangibles is not new--look at the amount of fighting and delays in publishing in the scientific world occurs over whose name goes first on a paper/book/study! There were some important ones held up for -years- over such disputes!  

<p>That's a subset of what might be called "fame-stealing" or "fame assigning" or other such things. 

<p>Another related example--I heard an NPR interview with a woman whose job is getting permission from people for them to appear identifiable on e.g. American's Dumbest Criminals. The reasons the people agree range from plain old financial remuneration, to their time unit of fame, to the comments made by a DUI offender who tried to bribe the arresting police officer with sex, she wanted the video public and a copy of it for herself as a tangible reminder she could playback anytime she was tempted to touch alcohol again, to show herself just how utterly depraved and disgusting she got when drinking, so she would NOT do so again.  

<p>But anyway, the lure of being of focused on and getting that -fame- and exposure, acted as a powerful incentive.

<p>MelbourneIT was not as merely clueless as the article makes out. When Alexis finally   did   reach the president's cell phone, all he got was a return call from the corporate attorney saying that they weren't going to do anything about it. 

<p>Likewise, Verislime was notified unforgeably (personal contact by personally-known people to their NOC), and they also refused to return the domain.

<p>Seth -- is the president of Melbourne IT clueful? (He should be, but is he?) That sounds like standard behavior of a non-geek CEO bothered about geek matters on a weekend (at least if the botherer isn't someone who can drop a hammer on the CEO's company). If MeIT was spun off from a university, who knows what kind of management it was left with? 

<p>   #19  :::  Metal Fatigue  :::  (view all by)  :::  January 20, 2005, 04:03 PM  : 

<p>Chip: From reports on NANOG, MIT's CTO, at least, appears to be a stand-up guy. The CEO...well, what do you think? 

<p>(Yes, I know that I am not the Seth from whom you expected a response, I just couldn't resist. Mr. Breidbart has gotten mail intended for me on at least one occasion, and vice versa. The first time we met in person, I was disappointed to find that we did not mutually annihilate in a shower of gamma rays.) 

<p>   #20  :::  CHip  :::  (view all by)  :::  January 20, 2005, 05:39 PM  : 

<p>Metal Fatigue: I think you support my point. Seth was damning the company for the actions of clueless top management. (Yes, it's nice when the CEO is responsible -- consider the round of idiot-CEO trials coming up -- but if the CTO is a standup guy it seems unlikely to me that the company as such could have committed a geek crime.) 

<p>   #21  :::  Steve Taylor  :::  (view all by)  :::  January 20, 2005, 05:44 PM  : 

<p>> Seth -- is the president of Melbourne IT clueful? 

<p>I'm not Seth either, but my impression was always that there was a disconnect between techies and management there. The tech people I worked with were serious and straightforward, while the management layer were the sort of people who went on about "Corporate Excellence" and "World Class Services" and so on.

<p>I can't be objective on this. I bought the domain name: 

<p>www.sherlockholmes.com 

<p>in late January 1996, from Verisign. I planned to use it for my business, and for my Mystery Writers part of my web domain. Then I had to shut down my 3-room office from which I ran Sherlock Holmes Resume Service (partner bailed on me, who'd split the rent). 

<p>So I changed the snailmail address on my domain registration to my home address, and Verisign agreed. End of the year, they snailmailed to my old office, and I never got that. Next thing I know, the domain name's scopped up by some obsessed fan who'd legally changed his name to Sherlock Holmes (you know, like that guy who comes to cons and shows you that his driver's license in in his legal name: James T. Kirk). 

<p>I could never get it back. So I have to use: 

<p>http://www.magicdragon.com/UltimateMystery/Mystery-Index.html 

<p>which just doesn't have the name-recognition and marketing pizazz. Not domainjacking. Just that Verisign never cared then, and doesn't care now.

<p>Changing the address on your domain registration does NOT automatically mean your billing address is updated accordingly. This sort of thing was unfortunately all too common with verisign at the time...  

<p>This is either a bug, or a feature, depending on how you look at the situation.

<p>  One Does Not Simply Walk Into Mordor 

<p>Bonus points for one of the better views of what my daughter & her girlfriends call "Oh look, it's Elijah Wood being asked a really hard math question". (Their casting question: why is Frodo so pretty when the other hobbits are so   normal   looking?) 

<p>   #26  :::  Graydon  :::  (view all by)  :::  January 23, 2005, 12:55 AM  : 

<p>Liz -- 

<p>There were three original tribes, or peoples, or whichever, of hobbits; Stoors, Harfoots, and Fallowhides. 

<p>After they stopped wandering around Wilderland, got over the Misty Mountains, and settled down in the Shire, these tribal distinctions mostly went away, but some of the older prominent families retained some of the characteristics thereof. 

<p>The important one for this purpose is that the Tooks retain a strong Fallowhide strain -- meaning that they tend to be thin (for Hobbits), 'bookish', 'pro-elvish interests' like book-learning and the lore of strangers, and pretty, rather than being robust or handsome -- and that Frodo has a lot of Took in him that, well, took. 

<p>So they cast Frodo to look outright Elvish, to go with the way he's described at various points. 

<p>Alternatively, most of the production was in the hands of rabid fangirls and they wanted Frodo to be really cute. 

<p>In the end, I think the second supposition has the better support on the basis of available evidence.

<p>Metal Fatigue: you are the anti-Seth? (I will leave aside a theological discussion about whether that necessarily makes you Osiris.) Perhaps you could supply antisethtics for the raffle at Lunacon. (No, seriously, Seth buys a lot of tickets and thus contributes lots of money to the cause. Whatever it is.) 

<p>At any rate, I think you actually agree with Paula, who was saying that mutual annihilation would be too mundane, and not involve sufficient abstruse math, to be the end of the Seth and the Anti-Seth.  

<p>I suggest that what actually happened when you met in the flesh is that each of you generated a virtual self, which changed places with the corresponding self of the other, and that the originals were, in fact, annihilated and replaced with the virtuals, not that it matters (npi), since they are identical in every respect. To a casual observer it would appear that you passed close to each other (or perhaps   through   each other, but no such observation has been reported in the Journal of Sethology) with no ill effects, whereas actually mutual annihilation was, in fact, achieved, but the matter generated was exactly equal to the energy released (minus a bit for entropy; I assume you felt somewhat tired after this event). 

<p>The abstruse math is left to the reader. If Catherine Asaro is out there, no doubt she can correct my physics (which is a little rusty, since I haven't studied it since about 1972).

<p>I will avoid abusing readers with Math and Physics, except to point out the current controversy about information being lost or not lost in Black Holes (Stephen Hawking admitting he was wrong, etc.). For our purposes, if Seth fell into a black hole, and Metal Fatigue did not, but Seth & anti-Seth are quantum entangled, then what happens to their blog postings?
