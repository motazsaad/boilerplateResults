<p>Lookin' Great and Feelin' Fine... 

<p>  Dude, Lita. Yer Mom's totally fuggly. 

<p>... we're the class of '89! Sorry, but I am genetically hard-wired to embrace and write about all musical nostalgia, even when it dates and debases me. This unique trick comes to us via   Roxanne   and   Jim Henley  ; finding the top 100 singles from the year of your high school graduation. 

<p>So, with all 100-long lists, I started off by thinking of some basic classifications: "That's a Kick-ass Song," "Pretty Good," "Semi-Listenable," "Makes Me Want to Kill Myself," and "Makes Me Want to Kill Myself After a Long Killing Spree." Then a took a closer look at the   list from 1989   (graduation   photo here   for confirmation, one of many embarrassing pictures on my Flickr site) and decided that about 90% of the songs would fall in the bottom category. Who knew that NKOTB, Roxette, and Milli Vanilli could all blow up in the same year? So, in order to keep it positive, I'm just going to list the songs I could listen to a 30-second snippet of without going homicidal/suicidal: 

<p>36. Buffalo Stance, Neneh Cherry    42. Bust A Move, Young M.C.   47. Love Shack, B-52's.   On second thought, no. Not any more.   51. So Alive, Love and Rockets. Just barely.   58. Sowing The Seeds Of Love, Tears For Fears    66. In Your Room, Bangles    68. Love Song, Cure    71. Patience, Guns N' Roses    74. Welcome To The Jungle, Guns N' Roses    76. Stand, R.E.M.    77. Close My Eyes Forever, Lita Ford    83. This Promise, When In Rome    86. Paradise City, Guns N' Roses    91. Poison, Alice Cooper    100. Keep On Movin', Soul II Soul 

<p>Only The Cure and Guns n' Roses remain on my digital jukebox, and their offerings are far from my favorites. That's not to say that I graduated into a wasteland; the following albums were   released that year   (in addition to all those alterna-albums that I can't possibly think of): 

<p>Bad Religion "No Control" // Beastie Boys "Paul's Boutique" // Camper Van Beethoven "Key Lime Pie" // Elvis Costello "Spike" // Faith No More "The Real Thing" // Lenny Kravitz "Let Love Rule" // Neil Young "Freedom" // New Order "Technique" // Nine Inch Nails // Nine Inch Nails "Pretty Hate Machine" // Nirvana "Bleach" // Public Image Limited "9" // Red Hot Chili Peppers "Mother's Milk" // Stevie Ray Vaughn "In Step" // The Flaming Lips "Telepathic Surgery" // The Pogues "Peace And Love" 

<p>Then I got to further "thinking"... MTV and Top 40 radio have always been geared towards middle-schoolers. I don't think that music got appreciably worse from during my high school years, but I'll bet that I retain more of an appreciation for   1985's unadulterated crap   (same list in the extended entry)... 

<p>5. I Feel For You, Chaka Khan    6. Out Of Touch, Daryl Hall and John Oates    7. Everybody Wants To Rule The World, Tears For Fears    8. Money For Nothing, Dire Straits    10. Take On Me, A-Ha    12. Easy Lover, Phil Collins and Philip Bailey    16. Don't You (Forget About Me), Simple Minds    18. St. Elmo's Fire (Man In Motion), John Parr    21. Shout, Tears For Fears    22. Part-Time Lover, Stevie Wonder    27. Miami Vice Theme, Jan Hammer    31. Oh Sheila, Ready For The World    36. The Wild Boys, Duran Duran   38. Neutron Dance, Pointer Sisters    41. Things Can Only Get Better, Howard Jones    46. Strut, Sheena Easton    51. Raspberry Beret, Prince and The Revolution   54. One Night In Bangkok, Murray Head    56. Obsession, Animotion   60. Head Over Heels, Tears For Fears   61. Axel F, Harold Faltermeyer    62. Smooth Operator, Sade    63. In My House, Mary Jane Girls    68. Voices Carry, 'Til Tuesday    70. Would I Lie To You?, Eurythmics    71. Be Near Me, ABC    75. Walking On Sunshine, Katrina and The Waves    76. Freedom, Wham!    77. Too Late For Goodbyes, Julian Lennon    83. Method Of Modern Love, Daryl Hall and John Oates    84. Lay Your Hands On Me, Thompson Twins    91. Jungle Of Love, The Time 

<p>Yes, ha-ha-ha. It's all very funny.

<p>I'm a year behind you, but the difference is striking. A whole lot of Wilson Phillips and Michael Bolton that year.

<p>I graduated in 89 too. I remember the late 80s being bad, but not that bad. So much stuff I had almost forgotten about. Also, some hair bands, but not as many as I remember. And reading into the 90s it's amazing stuff like Rod Stewart and Genesis were still stinking up the beginning of that decade. For some reason I thought they faded away after the mid 80s. 

<p>I remember the video for this one being strangely awful/fascinating: 

<p>9. Baby, I Love Your Way/Freebird, Will To Power  

<p>   Posted by:   Brian   at August 29, 2005 12:43 PM 

<p>1. I Will Always Love You, Whitney Houston   2. Whoomp! (There It Is), Tag Team   3. Can't Help Falling In Love, UB40   4. That's The Way Love Goes, Janet Jackson   5. Freak, Silk  

<p>   1993

<p>I'm also an '89er. Shitload of great music came out that summer. I think your list omits   Fear of a Black Planet  , which came out that fall (or was it spring of '90?). 

<p>And that album, uh, whips ass. 

<p>   Posted by:   dj moonbat   at August 29, 2005 01:04 PM 

<p>1983... Oh the pain! 

<p>But, seriously, who knew Frank Stallone had it in him to get to #93? 

<p>   Posted by:   Fritz   at August 29, 2005 01:12 PM 

<p>c/o '89 here too (I did my high school time in Tampa's colorful and rustic Cracktown neighborhood - oh, the memories). I must admit that it is truly humbling to look at both of those lists and think, my God - I used to   like   some of that shit! 

<p>  9. Baby, I Love Your Way/Freebird, Will To Power 

<p>I actually saw them perform (well, sort of) this abortion live, during Grad Nite at Disney World. Other "performers" (by which I mean, lip-synchers) that evening included Samantha Fox, New Kids on the Block, and Information Society. 

<p>Actually, there was someone else too, but he / they were so awful I was apparently forced to repress the memory.

<p>you really did suffer through white lion, didn't you?  

<p>no love for tone-loc or "batdance"? 

<p>   Posted by:   paperpusher   at August 29, 2005 01:23 PM 

<p>I graduated in 1987, and I think all I need to say about that year is that the number 1 song was "Walk Like An Egyptian" by The Bangles.  

<p>My least favorite song of all time checks in at No. 21: Chris de Burgh, "Lady In Red". My ears are spontaneously bleeding just thinking about it. 

<p>That was also the year that "The Rhythm (was) Gonna Get You", courtesy of Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound Machine. 

<p>In my life, that was the year I discovered Bob Dylan (for myself, everyone else already knew about him), and gorged myself on The Clash, The Ramones, and the Violent Femmes.

<p>BTW, you were way too kind to 1985. That list suh-ucks. 

<p>   Posted by:   spencer   at August 29, 2005 01:43 PM 

<p>Sweet Jesus, thank you for letting my memory fail when I got so old. 

<p>From 1972, not just one, but   two   versions of a Coke commercial (#93 and #97):

<p>YOu may find this of great great interest, what with all the musical bidness that goes down round these parts.

<p>   Posted by:   The Critic   at August 29, 2005 02:33 PM 

<p>Quaker, I was about 3 years old when you graduated, but I remember listening to those sings in the car as we drove to NY once or twice a month.  

<p>I think what all these lists are revealing is that the lowest common denominator, in any year, is nearly always crap.  

<p>   Posted by:   maurinsky   at August 29, 2005 02:34 PM 

<p>I graduated in '62 in SoCal. People wouldn't ride in my beautiful '48 Plymouth because I listened to country music. I still do, but it has expanded to "Americana". Wish I still had the car, too. 

<p>   Posted by:   Gordon   at August 29, 2005 02:59 PM 

<p>at the entirely opposite end of the spectrum, i think 1989 also marked the release of ministry's 'mind is a terrible thing to taste', skinny puppy's 'rabies', and possibly the revolting cocks 'beers, steers, and queers', of which i know at least this third one has fond memories in the thc-saturated nether-regions of good sir norbizness' brain. 

<p>as for myself, class of '92, all i can say is... 

<p>#2. baby. got. back. 

<p>   Posted by:   capital P   at August 29, 2005 03:20 PM 

<p>I can listed to almost all of the top 5 in '88 w/out becoming murderous /suicidal:   1. Faith, George Michael   2. Need You Tonight, INXS   3. Got My Mind Set On You, George Harrison   4. Never Gonna Give You Up, Rick Astley   5. Sweet Child O'Mine, Guns N Roses 

<p>- but within the top 10 a song that instantly qualifies:   9. Hands To Heaven, Breathe 

<p>   Posted by:   JenM   at August 29, 2005 03:32 PM 

<p>  I can listed to almost all of the top 5 in '88 w/out becoming murderous /suicidal: ...    4. Never Gonna Give You Up, Rick Astley 

<p>You know, Jen, you and I are very different people.  

<p>   Posted by:   Otto Man   at August 29, 2005 03:35 PM 

<p>I graduated in '92. The #1 song of that year? Why, the execrable, momentously sappy "End of the Road" by that great Bell Biv Devoe find, Boyz II Men. 

<p>Though the year is somewhat saved by the #2 song, Sir Mix A-Lot's timeless paean to the female posterior, "Baby Got Back". 

<p>"Smells Like Teen Spirit" - like it or not, arguably one of the most important and influential songs of the 90s - checks in at #32. Here are some of the songs that checked in ahead of Nirvana: 

<p>3. "Jump", Kris Kross - Jesus, put your clothes on right.  

<p>4. "Save the Best for Last", Vanessa Williams - post-Penthouse scandal, pre-ProActiv pimping. 

<p>6. "Tears in Heaven", Eric Clapton - I'm sympathetic to the devastating loss this song was inspired by, but dammit! Remember Cream, Eric? Do you remember that? 

<p>8. "Under the Bridge", Red Hot Chili Peppers - this actually deserves to be pretty high on the list, but above Nirvana? Methinks not. 

<p>9. "All 4 Love", Color Me Badd - there simply isn't enough snark left in the world to address this. 

<p>12. "To Be With You", Mr. Big - the official death knell of the power ballad. Thankfully. 

<p>14. "Black or White", Michael Jackson - well, Jacko? Which are you? 

<p>15. "Achy Breaky Heart", Billy Ray Cyrus - monster mullet and the birth of line dancing. Kee-rist. 

<p>18. "Life Is A Highway", Tom Cochrane - No, Tom. I really do   not   want to ride it all night long, thankyouverymuch. 

<p>21. "This Used To Be My Playground", Madonna - Ugh. Sentimental tripe. Madonna at her worst. 

<p>And at #33, the immortal Bobby Brown with "Humpin' Around", beating the truly excellent "Tennessee" by Arrested Development by seven places. Oy. Vey. 

<p>I do remember 1992 being this massive transition year, with the slow, embarrassing death of hair metal, the rise of grunge/alt-rock, the growing popularity of rap and hip-hop, the glorious last gasps of Richard Marx and Phil Collins... but, sweet Sky Fairy, that's a painful list. 

<p>   Posted by:   jpb   at August 29, 2005 03:37 PM 

<p>Geez, ya'll are jailbait. 

<p>   Posted by:   vachon Class of '73   at August 29, 2005 03:48 PM 

<p>Otto Man - 

<p>Just to clarify - I don't think the top five 88 song's are good ones, just ones I can hear and ignore as background noise... 

<p>   Posted by:   JenM   at August 29, 2005 05:20 PM 

<p>Norbizness must be a fellow closeted Hall & Oates fan. They are to Rick Astley what Bruce Lee is to Elvis in a gi. 

<p>Hall & Oates, Austin (Backyard) October 28, Houston (Verizon Theatre) October 30. Be there or, uh, stay in the closet. 

<p>   Posted by:   HWRNMNBSOL   at August 29, 2005 05:40 PM 

<p>  revolting cocks 'beers, steers, and queers' 

<p>I'm pretty sure that was before 1989, but I could be wrong (heavy chemical use in those days may have, um, modified certain memories to the point where they bear no semblance to actual events). 

<p>   Posted by:   spencer Fleury   at August 29, 2005 08:51 PM 

<p>  75. Walking On Sunshine, Katrina and The Waves  

<p>"What is least popular song this week in New Orleans," Alex? 

<p>   Posted by:   Chris Clarke   at August 29, 2005 08:54 PM 

<p>Norby is my cherry pie. 

<p>   Posted by:   teh l4m3   at August 29, 2005 09:08 PM 

<p>I doubt I'll ever "get" G'n'R. Axl and Slash just irritated the piss out of me, starting from the nasal shriek and going straight to the we're-not-a-hair-band hair.  

<p>   Posted by:   jackd   at August 29, 2005 09:34 PM 

<p>From Senior Year High School 1976, songs I can listen to without going nuts: 

<p> 5. Play That Funky Music, Wild Cherry    15. Love Hangover, Diana Ross    33. Golden Years, David Bowie    51. Dream On, Aerosmith    69. This Masquerade, George Benson    78. Got To Get You Into My Life, Beatles    93. Tear The Roof Off The Sucker, Parliament    99. Squeeze Box, The Who 

<p>   when I was 13 in 1971, actually some great songs I still like: 

<p> 2. Maggie May / (Find A) Reason To Believe, Rod Stewart    9. Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me), Temptations    18. Brown Sugar, Rolling Stones    21. What's Going On, Marvin Gaye    55. Proud Mary, Ike and Tina Turner    62. Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology), Marvin Gaye    81. I Hear You Knocking, Dave Edmunds    84. Won't Get Fooled Again, Who    89. Theme From "Shaft", Isaac Hayes 

<p>Conclusion: popular music was much better and much worse when I was younger. I think that's continued, less really goo or really bad stuff, much more mediocrity. 

<p>   Posted by:   HankP   at August 29, 2005 10:01 PM 

<p>I did my top 100 a few days ago and I think there are some songs I hated then that I actually like now (nostalgia factor, I guess). 

<p>Keep On Movin is a fine song, but Soul II Soul's moment of transcendence was Back To Life (not the a capella version). 

<p>   Posted by:   hope   at August 29, 2005 10:19 PM 

<p>Sorry, folks, "Beers, Steers, and Queers" is a 1993 release. Pushing it past even my own high school grad date. 

<p>   Posted by:   The Critic   at August 29, 2005 10:31 PM 

<p>Ok folk, lets first settle this Revolting Cocks thing. Beers, Steers & Queers" [album] (available on LP/Picture Disc 12"/CS/CD) 

<p>CS: WaxTrax! Records (WAXCS 7063) 1990 

<p>Not 1993, '89 etc. Secondly, let me say that I knew 1983 sucked musically, but Frank Stallone? Christ, the fact that Frank made it into ANY 100 list that wasn't entitled "100 Most (Pathetic) (Trite) (Grotesque).....All Hail Norbizness. 

<p>   Posted by:   Brian Curtis   at August 29, 2005 10:57 PM 

<p>Ahhhh, Revolting Cocks. I remember getting kicked out of high school for wearing a Cocks t-shirt. 

<p>Why is it that these lists, which document the best selling singles, are always remarked upon with scorn? Not that they shouldn't be, mind you, but tons of people listened to this crap so why is everyone afraid to admit it? Or are the people who listen to crap like this not into blogs? It's a mystery. 

<p>For the record, my 1987 list only has about 6 that are even passable and a whole bunch that I have never heard. 

<p>   Posted by:   platosearwax   at August 30, 2005 04:26 AM 

<p>Key Lime Pie, and I think The Pixies' Surfer Rosa came out that year, too. Swooon. 

<p>   Posted by:   drublood   at August 30, 2005 07:55 AM 

<p>I like about 40 songs from the top 100 of 1982.
