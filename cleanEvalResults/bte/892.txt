I think there were some images in the people section. Be worth doing a seach on some keywords like ...erm ... NZ, or something. I know Wazza (username) was involved as he had a daft old lens and took some good shots with it. Search for his user name. Maybe one of them is near Aukland. 

<p>Ah that would be our fine crowd, not sure about the drunk and naked stuff though? Anyway that group would be Moppie, Joseph, MThorpeDavies, ScottNZ, Wazza, and myself! Did I leave anyone else out? Anyway, we got together the first time a few weeks back, there have been a couple of less formal gatherings since then.   I know I am all too happy to assist! I suppose it depends on who is closest, I know Moppie, ScottNZ and I are all out in the Pakuranga Howick area, Wazza is a westie (should be obvious from that lens    ).   You can read about our escapades here:  http://www.photography-on-the.net/fo...highlight=GKPE   Or do a search on GKPE - Great Kiwi Photography-on-the.net Expedition

<p>Hi Tony! I'm from Auckland (Eastern suburbs.) I've been taking photos almost all of my life, but quite a newbie to doing things the manual way -- thanks to digital cameras I don't have to worry about the cost of processing!    There are quite a number of photography clubs in the country. Have a look at:   http://www.ivan.co.nz/ClubIndex.htm   to find one nearest you -- there are 4 camera clubs in Auckland: Manukau, North Shore, Henderson, and Howick.   I'm thinking of joining the Howick Camera Club (  http://www.howickcameraclub.org.nz/index.html  ) as they meet 3 times a month... though I don't plan on being there that often    Have a look at their website to have an idea of their activities.   Now, back to finding a job. It's a bummer when you're made redundant!   Cheers!   John

<p>Aha! another Easterner, Howick Camera Club is pretty good, although they do take things pretty seriously there, not so much the social aspect there. I went along for a while a few years back it was all rpint and slide back then, no digital, I hear things have changed now, and they are one of the top digital clubs inthe country. Toyed with the idea a bit since then.

<p>   Re: Help request from an Aucklander 

<p>Im in Mangere. I guess my biggest problem is Portraits in our lounge at night. just cant seem to get the lighting right. I have a Sunpack 455 Tri flash with a white unmbrella, an assortment of other lights. Im getting better, but Im still missing some key in my understanding about light shutter speed a F stops.I know what they all do but Im waiting for that &quot;eurika&quot; &quot;click&quot; to go off in my head.   I dont have a light meter / flash meter so to an extent im shooting in the dark (excuse pun. Night is the only time when my wife is able to be my model (mind you she did say last night I need to get a model, umm I dont think she would be happy with a 18yr old babe in the house).   I cant post pictures of our shoots as the arrangement was she would pose but I was not allowed to let anyone else see them. So that makes it a little harder for people to help. I have to respect her wishes or get a 18yr old babe    ummmmmmmmm

<p>Hi Tony,   I don't actually remember getting drunk or naked for that matter, but the guys on the outing are a great bunch and I'm sure will be able to help. Myself, I'm generally a portrait-free zone so not going to be much use to you - I have a 380EX but it gets very little use. Most of my photos' are landsacapes, aircraft etc where I have no control whatever on the lighting other than just turning up &amp; hoping it's okay!   cheers.

<p>Hmmm, most of the portrait work I do is natural light only, as artifical light is a bit of an art form in itself. For now it might be best to try and use some bright normal lights, and compensate in the white balance.    It will be very difficult to control all that flash light without a flash meter though. You should be able to get something OK with one flash and a brolly.   Can you post an example?   Might be able to swing by at some point, nights are best for my busy scehdule!
