<p>Stupp: Potts misses my point 

<p>  12/22/2006 12:03:07 PM 

<p>  
 From   JOE STRUPP  , Editor & Publisher: I appreciate Mark Potts   responding   to my list as it is here for discussion and critique. But I think HE misses my point. His overall view that the newspaper industry had finally figured out that it is in trouble is not news, they have realized it for years. Anyone who has followed the biz as we have knows, and E&P has been documenting in all aspects better than anyone, that the problems have been around for a while. It seems that he is the one who finally figured it out. 

<p> 
I agree that the industry has not done enough on the use of the Web and some other areas. But my goal was to look at the events of the year that have happened and mix them with what the future may require. My statement that the ‘Web Comes Of Age” was not a comment on the overall Web, but the newspaper industry’s use of it. That seemed pretty clear as the entire list was on the newspaper industry. Too bad Potts did not notice that. 

<p> 
The news of the year is not that the newspaper industry finally figured out that it had a problem, but that the industry has not seemed to nail down the solutions. My list notes in many areas where they have sought to make moves in a substantial way. It references web expansion, job cuts, ownership changes, and other specific stories, along with various non-business happenings that are just as important. That is the point of such a list, to analyze specific events during the year, not give some generality that offers little insight.   [Permalink]

<p>LAT publishers sacrificed more than Baquet 

<p>  12/20/2006 6:08:10 PM 

<p>  
 From   GARY DRETZKA  : I've been an editor, reporter and desk drone for several newspapers, including the Chicago Tribune. It strikes me as myopic that the New York Observer would   give   its Mensch Award to Dean Baquet without also acknowledging that the greater sacrifice probably came from the publishers -- both Tribune lifers -- who saw the light and "went native." 

<p> 
Dean's leadership qualities and many journalistic acomplishments assured him of a plethora of high-profile career options, no matter what he said or did in the wake of the departures of John Carroll and publishers John Puerner and Jeff Johnson. He tried mightily to play the Tribune's game, but, to almost no one's great surprise, it wasn't to be. His wasn't a suicide mission, and he'll live to fight again. 

<p> 
For a publisher to take a stand against his own employer is much riskier, in that corporate entities expect and demand loyalty as part of the job description of any senior manager. They know it going in, and are handsomely compensated for putting their ethical convictions on hiatus. It explains why publishers tend to be Republican, no matter the political leanings of their editorial boards. 

<p> 
I have no idea what John and Jeff are doing for work. I doubt they will be forced any time soon to join the legion of homeless folks who live in the shadow of the Times building. I'm more certain, though, they won't be receiving Man of the Year honors from E&P magazine or American Newspaper Publishers Association. 

<p> 
Give Dean his due, but don't forget the larger sacrifice. Something tells me that media organizations aren't standing in line to hire progressive publishers.   [Permalink]

<p>Retiring Union-Trib writer's spiked column 

<p>  12/19/2006 11:07:44 AM 

<p>  
 From   PRESTON TUREGANO  : I was among 43 employees of the San Diego Union-Tribune who retired this month as a result of an early retirement buyout to reduce the workforce and save salaries. I believe 19 of those 43 were newsroom staffers. I worked there 36 years. From my proposed final column, which was spiked because my standing Sunday Arts News Scene column wasn't the type that carried a mug shot, you will understand the saga of my stormy UT career. Many individuals here have asked me for a copy of the spiked swan song and I have sent it to them. You have my permission to post it.

ARTS NEWS SCENE COMMENTARY 

<p> 
By Preston Turegano 

<p>ARTS WRITER 

<p> 
Forty-odd years ago, certain things said about me by a classmate and a  

<p>teacher at Robert E. Lee High School in San Antonio, Texas helped set the stage for my career in journalism. 

<p> 
We'll start with the yearbook and school paper advisor/teacher, whom I  

<p>often interrupted as she rambled on about famous newspaper reporters she knew. She predicted I would never make a good reporter because I was "so rude." 

<p> 
Sorry, Mrs. Abbott, but chutzpah came in handy during my career as a U.S. Navy journalist and later a reporter for the Evening Tribune (which became the San Diego Tribune) that merged with The San Diego Union in 1992. 

<p> 
As of Dec. 15, I am a retired San Diego Union-Tribune arts writer; one of several company employees who this month accepted an early retirement incentive package. 

<p> 
My UT career began in 1970 as a copyboy (these days known as an "editorial assistant") and segued to general assignment reporter, which meant being equally ignorant about all subjects and willing to take on any assignment -- such as murders, fires, car wrecks, press conferences, and people who collect match book covers -- on a moment's notice./  CONTINUED BELOW 

<p>  

<p>Retiring Union-Trib writer's spiked column 

<p>  12/19/2006 11:05:27 AM 

<p>  
 Some GA stories dealt with the arts. Tribune editors knew I had a passion for classical music, theater and art. In 1984, one editor mumbled to me during a crack-of-dawn phone call that he wanted to go to the Old Globe Theatre in the wake of a fire that destroyed the Globe's outdoor stage. "You know those Globe types, so they'll talk to you," he said. 

<p> 
Types? 

<p> 
Over the years, I wrote arts stories, or did classical music reviews for the Tribune when the music critic was out of town or unavailable. When the Tribune and Union merged, I became the paper's first full-time arts news writer, chronicling arts organizations' hirings, firings, deficits, surpluses, government support, as well as projects, programming and trends. There are few feathers-ruffling exposes. Luck for me polonium 210 wasn't vogue at the time. 

<p> 
It may have been rude to ask arts administrators how much they earned, or their age, but someone had to pry and probe. (I often got the impression they would rather discuss their sex lives rather than disclose salary or age.) I reminded a few of the offended that a newspaper is the eyes and ears of the public, especially when it comes to nonprofit organizations that receive taxpayer dollars. I came to love IRS Form 990s, public documents that show how nonprofits raise and spend money. 

<p> 
Fast forward to another editor circa 1995, gruffly intoning to me, "People  

<p>in the arts community are afraid of you. I don't like that." 

<p> 
I did. 

<p> 
In late 1997, I took a break from arts news to cover local TV and radio  

<p>(and a goodly share of general TV programming) for approximately eight years. I now refer to that time as the dark years. It became darker as vapid, contrived reality shows swept the landscape. The only reality TV shows I've ever liked are Bowflex commercials. In any case, I occasionally made the lives of local TV and radio figures miserable. 

<p> 
After Welton Jones retired in 2001 as Union-Tribune critic-at-large and  

<p>arts news writer (which he took over when I went to TV and radio), I juggled broadcasting and arts writing. The arts and I reunited full-time two years ago. 

<p> 
As for that high school classmate's observation, anyone who knows me  

<p>personally or professionally is certain to agree with Marcia Guthridge. 

<p> 
"Preston, when you die, the world won't be able to stand the silence," she wrote in our graduation yearbook, sarcastically acknowleding my penchant for dishing and boisterously giving my opinion, especially when it wasn't solicited. 

<p> 
I'm not dying, but mourning is unavoidable right now. Letting go of familiar surroundings and long time work-related relationships equals loss. I adhere to the notion that some co-workers are like relatives; you love them, warts and all (and vice versa, of course). 

<p> 
As for silence, not now, thank you, except maybe on the third floor  

<p>newsroom of the Mission Valley Union-Tribune building. For me, the arts -- particularly San Diego's thriving community -- will always be something to shout about. As many have said, "the arts are the signature of civilization."  

<p> 
In these scary uncertain times, there's much to be said for the civility,  

<p>thought provocation and delight the arts bring to all of us, and for a big  

<p>part of my Union-Tribune career brought me a sense of pride and purpose.   [Permalink]

<p>Anti-war pundits who haven't been booked 

<p>  12/18/2006 3:35:06 PM 

<p>  
 From   CLIFF HUTCHINS  : In reponse to an   inquiry   regarding why those who were wrong about the Iraq war are still frequenting the airwaves, Howard Kurtz states that "the newscasts and talk shows would have a near-impossible time finding guests" to appear on their programs. If that were the case, it would most certainly be due to the fact that they were not looking very hard. Even a so-called liberal such as Keith Olbermann rarely has a genuine anti-war voice on his show. He and others could start by allowing such articulate spokespeople as Anthony Arnove, Howard Zinn, Amy Goodman, Kevin Zeese, Norman Solomon, Tariq Ali, Arundhati Roy, Camilo Mejia, Dahr Jamail, Nir Rosen, Peter Laufer, et al, to appear on their programs. In the lead up to the war, there was, astonishingly, only one anti-war person heard on the airwaves. it appears in late 2006, that the more things change, the more they remain the same.

<p>McClanahan has conflated historical events 

<p>  12/15/2006 10:00:25 AM 

<p>  
 From   DENNIS PERSICA  : Subject -- Saigon falling. Let's put things in factual perspective regarding the day Saigon fell. I don't know if the UPI staffers in Dallas cheered the day Saigon fell as Thomas McClanahan says they did. What's clear though is that, thirtysomething years later, he has conflated historical events. He said the people who cheered that day were, in his estimation, saying "Oh, goodie. The United States has lost a war." 

<p> 
By the time Saigon had fallen, the American involvement was already over. We had already taken most if not all of our troops, advisers, etc out of there. It's not like the people who were cheering -- if in fact they were cheering -- were happy about the death and destruction of American troops. The bulk of the troops were long gone and the huge casualty count for our side (though not as huge as what the Vietnamese of all political stripes had suffered) had tapered off a long time before 

<p>that. 

<p> 
I think McClanahan, intentionally or not, leaves the impression that the people who cheered were doing so while the lives of American military personnel were still at stake. They were not. 

<p> 
If people were cheering at UPI that day, it's unlikely they were cheering the defeat of America at that moment. That defeat already was a fait accompli; it was old news by the time Saigon fell.   [Permalink]

<p>Why UPIers may have cheered 

<p>  12/14/2006 6:12:52 PM 

<p>  
 From   JERRY McGINN  , retired, UPI/Spokane, Olympia, San Francisco:   [McGinn sent this letter to Kansas City Star columnist Thomas McClanahan and forwarded it to Romenesko] 

<p> 
Mr. McClanahan: 

<p> 
It's interesting that   you write   about how you got things so very wrong, then 

<p>blast UPI Dallas staffers for cheering the day Saigon fell. 

<p> 
I was in another hub, in sx (San Francisco), when Saigon fell and there was no such activity in the room. 

<p> 
If indeed what you report was true in Dallas, i suggest it was because the war had ended. Since you got everything else wrong, you might want to check that out. I remember distinct national relief that the war had ended.  

<p> 
I felt it myself.  

<p> 
I thought about the friends I had lost and was happy that others' friends from that moment on didn't have to die. I was wrong, of course.  

<p> 
Several friends died after years of incredible pain and suffering from wounds, both pysicial and emotional. But on that day, the operative word was relief.  

<p> 
As for me, I was assigned to meet a plane lifting a planeload of babies from orphanages in Saigon that was to land (and did) at sx (S.F.) International.  

<p> 
Our jobs, in other words, were not to stop working and start cheering. It was to cover the next chapter. And we did.  

<p> 
In 21 years with UPI, covering all angles of a thousand stories lent itself to having respect for all sides -- especially when covering same. 

<p> 
And at the end of this dismal war (Iraq) in which you apparently were a cheerleader for all the wrong reasons, there may again be relief that no one else has to die needlessly.  

<p> 
But there will also be suffering of a different kind to take its place. In the  

<p>U.S. it will be in the hospitals where the severely wounded will invest the rest of their lives trying to achieve a modicum of normalcy, or in the homes of those who lost their loved ones (in Iraq and In the US, btw) and in the mental institutes who will attempt to erase from the memories of those who witnessed this mess to regain their lost youths or minds. 

<p> 
And you, I predict, will get busy, soon, I suspect, latching onto another topic, or notion, and getting it wrong, and then reconciling with a cheap shot at someone else you likely will continue to misunderstand. 

<p> 
But it's not too late for you. You could do something useful.  

<p> 
You could latch onto the real victims of this war and deal with their stories. They will be limping past your office, panhandling in the street, limping to and fro and their parents and spouses will be mourning their lives for generations to come. 

<p> 
Bring them back or don't let them pass, like your mea culpa piece. Write about them. Meet their widows and kids 

<p> 
Don't let US forget them, their sacrifices. If you do that as best you can, 

<p>and never let go of the real long term effects of this cause you so wrongly beat the drum for, maybe you can really atone for the wrong you have wrought on your readers and me. And the reporters and writers in UPI Dallas, too. 

<p> 
Maybe.

And even the troubled Tribune Co. has been making profit margins that other industries would kill for.   [Permalink]

<p>UPIer wants KC Star columnist to apologize  

<p>  12/14/2006 3:17:11 PM 

<p>  
 From   TOM FOTY  :   [Foty sent this letter to the Kansas City Star after reading Tom McClanahan's December 10   column  . Foty tells Romenesko: "I was with UPI's radio network operation in New York and Washington 1973-84 as editor, reporter, Washington bureau manager and executive editor."] 

<p> 
Dear [Kansas City Star] Editor (with apologies for length): 

<p> 
In a recent commentary that could otherwise be characterized as a "mea  

<p>culpa" for no-longer operative Iraq policy boosterism, Tom McClanahan turns the clock back thirty one years in his career and makes an assertion about an early employer that defames a once great news organization. Trying to bolster a case for what he calls a "deep, unquestioning antipathy for all things military" which he maintains "still infects many in today's media," McClanahan says he was working for United Press International in Dallas in the spring of 1975 and adds: 

<p>  One sunny day in April, bells started ringing from the dozens of printers scattered around the room. We knew it was an item with "flash" priority, which carries 10 bells. I looked down. A printer tapped out: "Saigon falls." What happened next was astonishing. Many of my colleagues, young journalists who had come of age politically  

<p>during the heyday of the anti-war movement, stood up and 

<p>cheered. Oh, goodie. The United States has lost a war. Many were my  

<p>friends, but the scene left me cold. 

<p> 
It is not possible to prove a negative of course, but his account does leave much room for doubt about the accuracy of his recollections. 

<p> 
In the 1977 book "55 Days - The Fall of South Vietnam" (Prentice Hall), 

<p>Alan Dawson, UPI last Saigon bureau manager, describes and reproduces the UPI flash: 

<p>

<p>UPIer wants KC Star columnist to apologize  

<p>  12/14/2006 3:12:40 PM 

<p>  
 The indicated morning signoff times (on April 30, 1975) were those in Saigon. Because of uncertainty about whether South Vietnam observed  

<p>Daylight Saving Time or not, it is unclear whether the time difference with Dallas was ten hours or eleven. Regardless, that flash would have moved around 8:30 or 9:30 PM Central Saving Time. The sun would have had to set very late in Dallas that evening to conform to Mr. McClanahan's account. 

<p> 
Further, well-known "downhold" UPI staffing policies would have normally 

<p>precluded the presence of "many" people there at that hour. 

<p> 
The flash was sent by the "LD" in the initials ... Leon Daniel, UPI's veteran foreign and war correspondent and a Marine veteran of the Korean War. Bureau Manager Dawson and reporter Paul Vogle (the "PDV" initials) were both Army veterans of Vietnam, who stayed on there as civilian journalists. They all risked life and limb to report that piece of world history .. and all three stayed behind after the North Vietnamese takeover to continue to do so until the Hanoi authorities ordered them to leave. Dawson was the last American war reporter in Saigon. 

<p> 
Their colleagues the world over were busily engaged in transmitting their  

<p>dispatches to UPI's thousands of newspaper and broadcast clients and  

<p>gathering related local information, not in acting like stadium demonstrators. Just as UPI's famed Dallas bureau did twelve years earlier in the agency's Pulitzer Prize winning coverage of the John F. Kennedy assassination. 

<p> 
For Mr. McClanahan to assert what he does is to impugn at least the  

<p>professionalism, if not the patriotism, of his 1975 Dallas colleagues and  

<p>by extension, others then at UPI and now at other media organizations. 

<p> 
Unfortunately today's UPI is little more than a famous name, no longer a  

<p>vital news organization and not one that is likely to take issue with Mr.  

<p>McClanahan's broad assertions. That is not the case among his former UPI colleagues. Internet list recollections of him confirm his UPI employment in Cheyenne and apparently a shorter time at UPI's Southwest division headquarters in Dallas. There is no corroborating recollection of the picture he describes .... nor anything closely resembling it at UPI's many other bureaus or New York headquarters. At bare minimum, Mr. McClanahan owes history and his ex-colleagues an identification of those "many friends" who acted so unprofessionally .. if not an apology.

The letter [to Dave Winer] did not come from NPR but from This I Believe, Inc. the independent non-profit org that runs the well-known national essay multimedia project.

The NPR element of the project is only a fraction of its work: TIBI also uses the essay entries it receives in a book that was just released, extensively on its website and with schools and community groups. Submissions of essays are made to TIBI, not NPR, and TIBI makes the selections; likewise, this solicitation for donations came from TIBI, not us. The first I learned about the solicitation, written by XM host Bob Edwards on the project’s behalf, was actually on your website.

<p> 
Maxim, Stuff, FHM, etc are *lad* mags, and always have been. Near as I

<p>  
 From   SEAN SCULLY  : I have to agree with   Connie Chung   that pundits should quit analyzing Katie Couric, but I don't think it is because it is "too early." Instead, I think it is, if anything, "too late." The evening network news is hardly extinct, but it is painfully obvious that it is rapidly becoming a small part of the total news universe. Fewer and fewer people every year turn to the network news at all, let alone as their main news source. The are no bells and whistles - and no superstar anchors - that will change this. The network news was an institution created in a media era that is gone. It is slowly drifting into irrelevance as the audiences from that era age and Katie Couric can do nothing to halt that. It seems to me that worry about whether Katie is first, second or third, or obsessing about the details of her newscast, have all the relevance to modern media culture as a fierce debate about who runs the "swingingest big band in all the land."

<p>Treat AP story with caution 

<p>  12/13/2006 7:44:10 AM 

<p>  
 From   CRAIG PYES  , senior correspondent, Center for Investigative Reporting: As a person who has spent a fair share of time investigating deaths abroad, I remain perplexed by the manner of the AP's defense of their stories. Cpt. Hussein, the witnesses, the neighborhood, and the vicissitudes of reporting in Iraq -- all raised by AP's executive editor Kathleen Carroll -- are ancillary and anecdotal, and do little to prove or disprove their story. 

<p> 
The AP needs to come up with the corpus dilecti. I have not reported in Iraq, but I have reported in mosques, and generally the imam and the congregants would know who the victims are. AP's Nov. 28 story identified the mosque as the Mustafa Sunni mosque. It said a single witness identified one of the victims as the mosque's muezzin, Ahmed al-Mashadani. The "witness" said the other victims were also members of the al-Mashadani tribe. If AP can't confirm the victims' identities by talking to their families and friends, I would treat the story with caution.   [Permalink]

<p>Hussein's story rings true 

<p>  12/12/2006 7:01:49 PM 

<p>  
 From   DAVID McLEMORE  : I don't know Baghdad geography, nor can I answer Col. Bateman's   query   on why the major news organization haven't delved into the minutiae of AP and Capt. Hussein.  

<p> 
It is, however, very much a question of politics, with right-wing bloggers seizing on the questions about Capt. Hussein's existence as proof not only of AP's perfidy but a sign that the liberal-leaning media have intentionally faked the story of Iraq's decline and failed to see all that good news out there. 

<p> 
AP defends its story – and Capt. Hussein's existence – by noting they have used him as a source over the past two years on stories that panned out and that no one in the Iraqi government or US military has questioned those stories. 

<p> 
While AP defends its coverage, AP cameraman Aswan Lutfallah was killed in Iraq, shot to death by insurgents in Mosul, the third AP worker killed in the war. According to The Committee to Protect Journalists, that makes 90 journalists killed while covering Iraq.  

<p> 
As Kathleen Carroll, AP executive editor, said in her response to the Army's complaints about Hussein, AP has gone back into the district three times, confirming the story not only with Capt. Hussein but with three other witnesses who told of the burning deaths in the mosque. Photos show the Mustafa mosque badly damaged from explosives and marred by fire. 

<p> 
Col. Bateman is right to raise questions, though I fear the madhouse that Baghdad has become is perhaps now too difficult to make much sense of. He speaks of 'normal sources' in a place where normalcy is in short supply. The comparison to police precincts in New York boroughs doesn't work for me – unless Protestant police in the Big Apple are systematically killing the Catholics.

We may never get a satisfactory answer about Capt. Husssein's role. Whether he exists or whether AP has fuzzed his identity to help keep him alive a day or two longer, his account, and that of the eyewitnesses, is consistent with the horrors that have turned Hurriyah District – as well as other parts of Baghdad – into a charnel house. That part is difficult for even the Ministry of Information to deny.   [Permalink]

<p>Why attack may have been underplayed

 From   MICHAEL HEWITT  : David Mills makes many excellent   points   about the L.A. Times' undercoverage of the Halloween attack but omits the most important factor: It happened in Long Beach. 

<p> 
The Times' coverage of L.A. County's second-largest city (population 

<p>490,000) ranges from poor to non-existent. I'm sure that if the attack had 

<p>happened north of the 91, the LAT would have done much more with the 

<p>story.   [Permalink]

 From   TREVOR BUTTERWORTH  : Dan Le Batard follows the well-worn path into nonsense trod by many a philosopher-reporter when it comes to objectivity.   He tells us: 

<p> 
"But, in general, objectivity is a lie, an illusion." [Objective statement, i.e., it's a statement whose truth or falsity is not dependent on the perception of the author; if objectivity is a lie, the claim holds true independent of whether Mr. Le Batard thinks it is true; therefore the statement is false.] "We all have our baggage." [ditto Mr. Le Batard doesn't merely think or feel that we all have baggage: WE ALL have baggage.] "Being objective isn't very human." [ditto - with the added bonus that communication would be impossible without the concepts of objectivity and subjectivity] "Neither is journalism sometimes." [ditto] "Best a journalist can do is try to be self-aware and aspire to objectivity.[ditto]
