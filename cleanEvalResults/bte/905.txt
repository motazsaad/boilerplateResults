<p>Received my copy of Wired but haven&#8217;t had a chance to read it yet&#8230;Looking forward to learning more about you. I will certainly give Foxfire a try. Live free&#8230;

<p>Firefox&#8230;&#8230;an inspiration!!

<p>I picked up a copy of Wired magazine with your pic on the cover and read the Firefox article on my flight to Florida. I just recently downloaded firefox when a friend emailed me the link about a month ago. 

<p>What I found intriguing about the article in Wired was the security issue and the stark contrast between the time it takes for MS programmers to fix an IE bug vs. the developers who team up to fix an firefox bug in a percentage of the time. 

<p>I believe an analogy can be made regarding the critical importance of international cooperation (working in teams as opposed to the hegemony of working unilaterally) when it comes to fighting the worst ills of our present age such as drug trafficking, terrorism and the like.  

<p>In the NY Times article last year which featured Senator John Kerry on the cover, Kerry said as much but instead amidst the Media presidential campaign hoopla his message was twisted into an incomprensible sound bite that was taken out of context. In other words, terrorism should not be fought using Cold War period tactics and a Cold War paradigm but the technology available today in the Net Age. 

<p>Politics affects everything nomatter what denial some people indulge in. Therefore, I would love to hear what developers thing about this idea!

<p>It&#8217;s so inspiring to see people take advantage of their talents to give back to the world. Thanks for sharing your smarts with us&#8211;Firefox is awesome!

<p>Hi, I just found your website through a blog and I can&#8217;t believe you are the creater of FireFox! So young and talented! If you are ever thinking about a vacation, come to Hawaii where I live.  

<p>   AdamStac   Says:   January 24th, 2005 at 11:29 pm 

<p>Blake I love that cover - it closely matches the colors that I have chosen for   my blog  . I have to agree with general consensus on your age. Congrats on your sauces, and Firefox&#8217;s sauces for that matter&#8230;it&#8217;s all I&#8217;ll ever use - that&#8217;s for sure.  

<p>   AdamStac   Says:   January 24th, 2005 at 11:30 pm 

<p>sauces = success! LOL!!  

<p>   arbitraryaardvark   Says:   January 25th, 2005 at 1:52 pm 

<p>Firefox sauces. Great idea adam.   One of many many possible lucrative spinoffs. Blake do you have an agent?  

<p>   MacGeneral   Says:   January 25th, 2005 at 2:59 pm 

<p>Some very interesting comments Mr. Ross. Perhaps less a commentary on the nature of technology, web browsing, or UberGeeking, and more of a statement of the current nature of personkind.

<p>So much for NADA&#8230; another Bill Gates in the making!! Just wait 20 years, and we all shall PAY him instead. The only way Netscape lost the war, is because they charged too much, GREED! FAME! &#038; ADULATION! I particulary don&#8217;t like MS, but it is free and widely used all around, and it is a challenge to use, the spice of life. Good luck and break a leg!

<p>I&#8217;ve been watching Mozilla for a long time. I work at a media company and had the pleasure of meeting members of the Mozilla Evangelist group. I have to say that in my years of developing web applications and software I never thought I would see a browser impact MicroSh1t as much as you have. 

<p>I am a Firefox evangelist and I whole-heartedly preach it to all my friends, family and colleagues. 

<p>Keep up the awesome work and good luck in your future! 

<p>Firefox Rox!

<p>I’m 20, but can’t imagine doing what you are doing. You are an inspiration, thanks for helping us take back the web, and good luck with everything.

<p>You&#8217;re really great. Hopefully, I&#8217;ll be able to make IE dominate Firefox soon.

<p>As the iT coordinator of a high school specialty program outside of washington DC I am sooo glad to see and pass to my 550 iT students that there is hope agaisnt the giants like Microsoft. Your browser is super! You are fast becoming a national treasure.

<p>Congratulations to your efforts on Firefox. And you well deserve to be on the cover of &#8220;Wired&#8221;. I also appreciate the opinions expressed within your blog aticles. Remember they called Marc Andreessen the &#8220;next Bill Gates&#8221; ten years ago - I am sure you will not share his fate.  

<p>   Alexander   Says:   February 27th, 2005 at 10:06 pm 

<p>whats the big deal its only a netscape behide it nothing new, for those of you out their who thinks this is amuising, this code has been stolen and recomplied, only the GUI has changed and few plugins add&#8217;ed. thats all nothing much new, the microsoft internet broswer has settings which control how you surf shame you havnt figured it out yet. firefox only good for popups,

<p>I agree with all those who say you are very good looking to the point of sexy. Been using Firefox on my PC and my Mac since 0.9. A hot piece of software made by a hot person; that should become the norm. Instead of sex, how about dinner and a movie first? Is that ball on eBay?
