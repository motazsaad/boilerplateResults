<p>  Come visit me on my new WordPress blog 

<p>I should have been clearer. My new blog is over on WordPress's new hosted service, which is still in beta. I've been posting frequently over there.   http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/ 

<p>I'm still playing around, though, and learning the new system. I'm also setting up a separate blog over on TypePad to learn that blog tool. And have yet another one over on DABU too. 

<p>Oh, and of course, there's   our book blog   (which is also on TypePad) and the Channel 9 video blog, done on modified version of Community Server. So, I'm getting around to a variety of blog tools and services. I find I don't like a lot about all the tools. It's interesting to me that no one has really come out with a big blog breakthrough lately. 

<p>I'm getting another demo of Flock tomorrow, too. 

<p>Oh, and ou might check in on   Channel 9
