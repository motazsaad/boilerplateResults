 Tea for the Tillerman 

<p>  Tea for the Tillerman is probably the most well-known of Cat Stevens' albums. Even if you've never heard of Cat Stevens, you've probably heard "Wild World". Most of these songs seem to be very "down to earth" and about problems/pleasures that we deal with on an everyday basis, unlike some of his other albums where he writes songs that have more spiritual and imaginitive lyrics.

<p>  Where Do The Children Play? 

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Well I think it's fine, building jumbo planes.  

<p>Or taking a ride on a cosmic train.  

<p>Switch on summer from a slot machine.  

<p>Yes, get what you want to if you want, 'cause you can get anything.  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>I know we've come a long way,  

<p>We're changing day to day,  

<p>But tell me, where do the children play?  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Well you roll on roads over fresh green grass.  

<p>For your lorry loads pumping petrol gas.  

<p>And you make them long, and you make them tough.  

<p>But they just go on and on, and it seems that you can't get off.  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Oh, I know we've come a long way,  

<p>We're changing day to day,  

<p>But tell me, where do the children play?  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Well you've cracked the sky, scrapers fill the air.  

<p>But will you keep on building higher  

<p>'til there's no more room up there?  

<p>Will you make us laugh, will you make us cry?  

<p>Will you tell us when to live, will you tell us when to die?  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>I know we've come a long way,  

<p>We're changing day to day,  

<p>But tell me, where do the children play?  

<p>  &nbsp;

<p>  Hard Headed Woman 

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>I'm looking for a hard headed woman,  

<p>One who will take me for myself,  

<p>And if I find my hard headed woman,  

<p>I won't need nobody else, no, no, no.  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>I'm looking for a hard headed woman,  

<p>One who will make me do my best,  

<p>And if I find my hard headed woman  

<p>I know the rest of my life will be blessed -- yes, yes, yes.  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>I know a lot of fancy dancers,  

<p>people who can glide you on a floor,  

<p>They move so smooth but have no answers.  

<p>When you ask "Why'd you come here for?"  

<p>"I don't know" "Why?"  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>I know many fine feathered friends  

<p>but their friendliness depends on how you do.  

<p>They know many sure fired ways  

<p>to find out the one who pays  

<p>and how you do.  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>I'm looking for a hard headed woman,  

<p>One who will make me feel so good,  

<p>And if I find my hard headed woman,  

<p>I know my life will be as it should -- yes, yes, yes.  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>I'm looking for a hard headed woman,  

<p>One who will make me do my best,  

<p>And if I find my hard headed woman...  

<p>  &nbsp; 

<p>  &nbsp; 

<p>  Wild World 

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Now that I've lost everything to you  

<p>You say you wanna start something new  

<p>And it's breakin' my heart you're leavin'  

<p>Baby, I'm grievin'  

<p>But if you wanna leave, take good care  

<p>Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear  

<p>But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world  

<p>It's hard to get by just upon a smile  

<p>Oh, baby, baby, it's a wild world  

<p>I'll always remember you like a child, girl  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do  

<p>And it's breakin' my heart in two  

<p>Because I never wanna see you a sad, girl  

<p>Don't be a bad girl  

<p>But if you wanna leave, take good care  

<p>Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there  

<p>But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Chorus  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Baby, I love you  

<p>But if you wanna leave, take good care  

<p>Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there  

<p>But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Chorus  

<p>  &nbsp; 

<p>  &nbsp; 

<p>  Sad Lisa 

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>She hangs her head and cries on my shirt.  

<p>She must be hurt very badly.  

<p>Tell me what's making you sadly?  

<p>Open your door, don't hide in the dark.  

<p>You're lost in the dark, you can trust me.  

<p>'Cause you know that's how it must be.  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa.  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Her eyes like windows, tricklin' rain  

<p>Upon her pain getting deeper.  

<p>Though my love wants to relieve her.  

<p>She walks alone from wall to wall.  

<p>Lost in a hall, she can't hear me.  

<p>Though I know she likes to be near me.  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa.  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>She sits in a corner by the door.  

<p>There must be more I can tell her.  

<p>If she really wants me to help her.  

<p>I'll do what I can to show her the way.  

<p>And maybe one day I will free her.  

<p>Though I know no one can see her.  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Lisa Lisa, sad Lisa Lisa.  

<p>  &nbsp;

<p>  Miles From Nowhere 

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Miles from nowhere  

<p>I guess I'll take my time  

<p>Oh yeah, to reach there  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Look up at the mountain  

<p>I have to climb  

<p>Oh yeah, to reach there.  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Lord my body has been a good friend  

<p>But I won't need it when I reach the end  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Miles from nowhere  

<p>Guess I'll take my time  

<p>Oh yeah, to reach there  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>I creep through the valleys  

<p>And I grope through the woods  

<p>'cause I know when I find it my honey  

<p>It's gonna make me feel good  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>I love everything  

<p>So don't it make you feel sad  

<p>'cause I'll drink to you, my baby  

<p>I'll think to that, I'll think to that.  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Miles from nowhere  

<p>Not a soul in sight  

<p>Oh yeah, but it's alright  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>I have my freedom  

<p>I can make my own rules  

<p>Oh yeah, the ones that I choose  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Lord my body has been a good friend  

<p>But I won't need it when I reach the end  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Miles from nowhere  

<p>Guess I'll take my time  

<p>Oh yeah, to reach there.  

<p>  &nbsp; 

<p>  &nbsp; 

<p>  But I Might Die Tonight 

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Don't want to work away  

<p>Doin' just what they all say  

<p>"Work hard boy and you'll find  

<p>One day you'll have a job like mine"  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>'Cause I know for sure  

<p>Nobody should be that poor  

<p>To say yes or sink low  

<p>Because you happen to say so, say so, you say so  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>I don't want to work away  

<p>Doing just what they all say  

<p>"Work hard boy and you'll find  

<p>One day you'll have a job like mine, job like mine, a job like mine"  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>"Be wise, look ahead  

<p>Use your eyes" he said  

<p>"Be straight, think right  

<p>But I might die tonight!"  

<p>  &nbsp; 

<p>  &nbsp; 

<p>  Longer Boats 

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Longer boats are coming to win us  

<p>They're coming to win us, they're coming to win us  

<p>Longer boats are coming to win us  

<p>Hold on to the shore, they'll be taking the key from the door.  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>I don't want no god on my lawn  

<p>Just a flower I can help along  

<p>'Cause the soul of no body knows  

<p>how a flower grows... Oh how a flower grows.  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Chorus  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Mary dropped her pants by the sand  

<p>And let a parson come and take her hand  

<p>But the soul of no body knows  

<p>Where the parson goes, where does the parson go?  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Chorus  

<p>  &nbsp; 

<p>  &nbsp; 

<p>  Into White 

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>I built my house from barley rice  

<p>Green pepper walls and water ice  

<p>Tables of paper wood, windows of light  

<p>And everything emptying into White.  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>A simple garden, with acres of sky  

<p>A Brown-haired dogmouse  

<p>If one dropped by  

<p>Yellow Delanie would sleep well at night  

<p>With everything emptying into White.  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>A sad Blue eyed drummer rehearses outside  

<p>A Black spider dancing on top of his eye  

<p>Red legged chicken stands ready to strike  

<p>And everything emptying into White.  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>I built my house from barley rice  

<p>Green pepper walls and water ice...  

<p>And everything emptying into White  

<p>  &nbsp; 

<p>  &nbsp; 

<p>  On The Road To Find Out 

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Well I left my happy home to see what I could find out  

<p>I left my folk and friends with the aim to clear my mind out  

<p>Well I hit the rowdy road and many kinds I met there  

<p>Many stories told me of the way to get there  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>So on and on I go, the seconds tick the time out  

<p>There's so much left to know, and I'm on the road to find out  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Well in the end I'll know, but on the way I wonder  

<p>Through descending snow, and through the frost and thunder  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Well, I listen to the wind come howl, telling me I have to hurry  

<p>I listen to the robin's song saying not to worry  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>So on and on I go, the seconds tick the time out  

<p>There's so much left to know, and I'm on the road to findout  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Then I found myself alone, hopin' someone would miss me  

<p>Thinking about my home, and the last woman to kiss me, kiss me  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>But sometimes you have to moan when nothing seems to suit yer  

<p>But nevertheless you know you're locked towards the future  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>So on and on you go, the seconds tick the time out  

<p>There's so much left to know, and I'm on the road to findout  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Then I found my head one day when I wasn't even trying  

<p>And here I have to say, 'cause there is no use in lying, lying  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Yes the answer lies within, so why not take a look now?  

<p>Kick out the devil's sin, pick up, pick up a good book now  

<p>  &nbsp; 

<p>  &nbsp; 

<p>  Father and Son 

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Father  

<p>It's not time to make a change,  

<p>Just relax, take it easy.  

<p>You're still young, that's your fault,  

<p>There's so much you have to know.  

<p>Find a girl, settle down,  

<p>If you want you can marry.  

<p>Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy.  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>I was once like you are now, and I know that it's not easy,  

<p>To be calm when you've found something going on.  

<p>But take your time, think a lot,  

<p>Why, think of everything you've got.  

<p>For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not.  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Son  

<p>How can I try to explain, when I do he turns away again.  

<p>It's always been the same, same old story.  

<p>From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen.  

<p>Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away.  

<p>I know I have to go.  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Father  

<p>It's not time to make a change,  

<p>Just sit down, take it slowly.  

<p>You're still young, that's your fault,  

<p>There's so much you have to go through.  

<p>Find a girl, settle down,  

<p>if you want you can marry.  

<p>Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy.  

<p>(Son-- Away Away Away, I know I have to  

<p>Make this decision alone - no)  

<p>Son  

<p>All the times that I cried, keeping all the things I knew inside,  

<p>It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it.  

<p>If they were right, I'd agree, but it's them you know not me.  

<p>Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away.  

<p>I know I have to go.  

<p>(Father-- Stay Stay Stay, Why must you go and  

<p>make this decision alone?)

<p>  Tea For The Tillerman 

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Bring tea for the Tillerman  

<p>Steak for the sun  

<p>Wine for the women who made the rain come  

<p>Seagulls sing your hearts away  

<p>'Cause while the sinners sin, the children play  

<p>&nbsp;  

<p>Oh Lord how they play and play
