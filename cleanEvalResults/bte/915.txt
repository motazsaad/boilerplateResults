 Re: Q&amp;A Round XIV - Answers Published 

<p>OOC :    E=mc squared. Energy can be directly converted into mass, although it does take rather a lot of it. However, given the huge supply of energy available to things in open space without atmospheric shielding, and a length of time comparable to even our own relatively young planet of Earth, it is possible for enough energy to be converted into mass to form a planet-sized object. As gravity increases more atmosphere will be retained (assuming some sort of magnetic field, which is possible, just not very likely without minerals), and the thickness of the atmosphere, and probably an Ozone layer, which will block much of that radiation. By this time, though, the mass and dimension of the object will be sufficient to promote collisions with space-junk (meteors) which will also, very slowly, add to the mass of the body. Although, as metors tend to be Nickle and Iron rich, we return to minerals being present...somewhere.    Atys may well have grown without any starting mass to grow from, a microscopic spore floating through space.   IC:    Aye, dis ball grewed aight.

<p>    Eh? L2 has a lil thingy called &quot;karma&quot; that turns your name red if you kill players for no good reason and this player doesn't fight back but that doesn't stop the 1337 kiddies from ganking...

<p>It probably started out as a single-cell organism, that started clumping together in a so-called bio-film. Within that film, certain cells developed in different directions all after what was needed in a symbiotic relationship, and slowly the first plants developed.   How those cells developed, is another story. Several competing and complementing theories exist for the stages between the organic soup and the early cells.   Btw, Atys must have some significant sources of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen near. Wood is made up of cellulose, hemi-cellulose and lignin, all of which are poly-saccharides, (C6H12O6)n. My guess is the big gas giant and its ring system.

<p>This is very disappointing. I pay a monthly fee to play the game. I don't want to spend gametime surfing the web to figure out what's going on inside the game. 

<p>    I see the chronicles site as a missed opportunity. It has made it more difficult rather than easier to track things. Now we have to look in three places, the main lore/background pages on   www.ryzom.com  , the forums and now the chronicle site as well. It would be far better if the material was consolidated into one place. The background material needs a good overhaul and improvement too.
