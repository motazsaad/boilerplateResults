<p>  How to purchase tickets 

<p> Tickets can be purchased on the   Tickets page   of the shop's website.    While placing the order you will be asked to type in some information: your name, type and quantity of tickets, e-mail address, and credit card information. You will receive a confirmation, as well as the Ticket Vouchers, via the e-mail address that you provide to us, so it is very important that all of the information you entered is valid and correct.  

<p>  If you wish to buy two different types of tickets, you should place a separate order.  

<p>Once you place your order through the website, you will receive an automated confirmation email, acknowledging that your order was received. If you did not receive this immediate confirmation email, containing your order number, it is mostly likely due to either an incorrect email address being provided or your email program blocking the sender (us). 

<p>In one to three days after the order is placed and payment is verified, you will receive another e-mail, this time containing the Ticket Voucher (proof of purchase) in an attached PDF file. You might want to turn off your SPAM/junk filter, during the time you are waiting to receive our email, since your mail server may block these emails or put them to the SPAM/junk folder. You should contact our Customer Service on the 4th day if you still have not received your Voucher. 

<p>  Note: In order to view and print PDF files, you will need to download a free copy of   Adobe Acrobat Reader  . To open an Acrobat Reader file (a PDF file), double-click on it. 

<p>The   Order change and Order cancellation policy   applies to ticket sales. Unused Vouchers are refundable upon cancellation (less Processing Service Fee).  

<p>  A nonrefundable Processing Service Fee $3.95 applies per each Ticket sold  .  

<p>There are certain categories of visitors who are eligible for a free admission. You can find information about this below in the section entitled   &quot;Eligible for a free admission&quot;  .

<p>Most special order products require extensive time for delivery, usually several weeks (more detailed information is available in the catalog). When placing a special order the customer will be asked to make an advanced payment, usually 30% of the total product price. Once the product is ready for shipping, the customer will be informed via phone or e-mail and will be requested to settle the balance of the order. Product shipment will take place after this second payment is verified. 

<p>The refunds or cancellation policy of special orders is the following: 

<p>Changes or cancellations will be accepted at no charge until the request to manufacture the item is placed with the original item manufacturer.  

<p>After the special order has been placed with the product manufacturer, a cancellation will result in the customer losing his/her advance payment. Special order changes will be accepted at our discretion, possibly for an additional charge.  

<p> After the final payment, no refunds or order cancellation will be accepted on special orders.
