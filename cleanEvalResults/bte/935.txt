<p>Friday Ark 

<p>Cats, Dogs, Spiders and ? every Friday.

<p>I'm doing my usual Friday Rat Blogging, featuring Arthur, Misto, and Ratbskuttle this week:  http://publius.mu.nu/archives/078632.html 

<p>   Posted by   Victor   at April 29, 2005 4:42 AM 

<p>Rabscuttle. It's spelled "Rabscuttle."  

<p>Sad, isn't it? When I can't spell my pet's name w/o coffee?

<p>I also have a post on horseshoe crabs. 

<p>   Posted by   afarensis   at April 29, 2005 6:27 AM 

<p>Actually, while Colin is mentioned over on Running Scared, the cat in the picture is Spider, who has not been seen much of late on the blog. Sorry about the confusion.

<p>We have seven photos of invertebrates. We just couldn't decide which one to send. One photo is of a sea cucumber that we just took on Wednesday.   http://newdharmabums.blogspot.com/2005/04/invertebrates-dead-and-alive.html 

<p>   Posted by   Rexroths Daughter   at April 29, 2005 8:33 AM 

<p>Since there are no decent pictures available of our newest avian celebrity, the ivory-billed woodpecker, would you settle for an illustration by the great John James Audubon himself?

<p>Slime mold! This is GREAT. Invertebrates are people too! 

<p>We have some recently hatched Polyphemus moth caterpillars being raised. Photos of hatching (4/24/05 post) and week-old babies (4/26 post) currently posted. Sorry it's Sunday! If I may I'll try to get a new update photo next Friday?
