 lyrics by EH Harburg and music by Harold Arlen 

<p>  

<p>  

<p> (DOROTHY)  

<p> When all the world is a hopeless jumble  

<p> And the raindrops tumble all around  

<p> Heaven opens a magic lane  

<p> When all the clouds darken up the skyway  

<p> There's a rainbow highway to be found  

<p> Leading from your window pane  

<p> To a place behind the sun  

<p> Just a step beyond the rain  

<p>  
 Somewhere over the rainbow way up high  

<p> There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby  

<p> Somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue  

<p> And the dreams that you dare to dream  

<p> Really do come true  

<p>  
 Some day I'll wish upon a star  

<p> And wake up where the clouds are far behind me  

<p> Where troubles melt like lemon drops  

<p> Away above the chimney tops  

<p> That's where you'll find me  

<p>  
 Somewhere over the rainbow blue birds fly  

<p> Birds fly over the rainbow  

<p> Why then, oh why can't I?  

<p> If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow  

<p> Why oh why can't I?  

<p>  

<p>  

<p> (Glinda)  

<p> Come out, come out wherever you are  

<p> And meet the young lady who fell from a star  

<p> She fell from the sky, she fell very far  

<p> And Kansas she says is the name of the star  

<p>  
 (Munchkins)  

<p> Kansas she says is the name of the star  

<p>  
 (Glinda)  

<p> She brings you good news, or haven't you heard  

<p> When she fell out of Kansas a miracle occurred  

<p>  
 (Dorothy)  

<p> It really was no miracle  

<p> What happened was just this:  

<p> The wind began to switch the house to pitch  

<p> And suddenly the hinges started to unhitch  

<p> Just then the witch, to satisfy an itch  

<p> Went flying on her broomstick thumbing for a hitch  

<p>  
 (Munchkin Man)  

<p> And oh what happened then was rich  

<p>  
 (Munchkins)  

<p> The house began to pitch, the kitchen took a slitch  

<p> It landed on the wicked witch in the middle of a ditch  

<p> Which was not a healthy situation for the wicked witch  

<p>  
 The house began to pitch, the kitchen took a slitch  

<p> It landed on the wicked witch in the middle of a ditch  

<p> Which was not a healthy situation for the wicked witch  

<p> Who began to twitch, and was reduced to just a stitch  

<p> Of what was once the wicked witch  

<p>  
 (Munchkin 1)  

<p> We thank you very sweetly for doing it so neatly  

<p>  
 (Munchkin 2)  

<p> You've killed her so completely  

<p> That we thank you very sweetly  

<p>  
 (Glinda)  

<p> Let the joyous news be spread  

<p> The wicked, old witch at last is dead  

<p>  
 (Munchkins)  

<p> Ding-dong the witch is dead  

<p> Which old witch? The wicked witch  

<p> Ding-dong the wicked witch is dead  

<p> Wake up you sleepyhead  

<p> Rub your eyes, get out of bed  

<p> Wake up the wicked witch is dead  

<p> She's gone where the goblins go  

<p> Below - below - below  

<p> Yo-ho, let's open up and sing and ring the bells out  

<p> Ding Dong' the merry-oh, sing it high, sing it low  

<p> Let them know the Wicked Witch is dead  

<p>  
 (Mayor)  

<p> As mayor of the Munchkin City  

<p> In the county of the land of Oz  

<p> I welcome you most regally  

<p>  
 (Judge)  

<p> But we've got to verify it legally  

<p> To see...  

<p>  
 (Mayor)  

<p> To see...  

<p>  
 (Judge)  

<p> If she...  

<p>  
 (Mayor)  

<p> If she...  

<p>  
 (Judge)  

<p> Is morally, ethically  

<p>  
 (Munchkin 1)  

<p> Spiritually, physically  

<p>  
 (Munchkin 2)  

<p> Positively, absolutely  

<p>  
 (Munchkin Men)  

<p> Undeniably and reliably dead  

<p>  
 (Coroner)  

<p> As Coroner , I thoroughly examined her  

<p> And she's not only merely dead  

<p> She's really most sincerely dead  

<p>  
 (Mayor)  

<p> Then this is a day of independence for all the munchkins  

<p> And their descendants  

<p> Yes, let the joyous news be spread  

<p> The wicked old witch at last is dead  

<p>  
 (Munchkins)  

<p> Ding-dong the witch is dead  

<p> Which old witch? The wicked witch  

<p> Ding-dong the wicked witch is dead  

<p> Wake up you sleepyhead  

<p> Rub your eyes, get out of bed  

<p> Wake up the wicked witch is dead  

<p> She's gone where the goblins go  

<p> Below - below - below  

<p> Yo-ho, let's open up and sing and ring the bells out  

<p> Ding Dong' the merry-oh, sing it high, sing it low  

<p> Let them know the Wicked Witch is dead

<p> Because, because, because, because, because  

<p> Because of the wonderful things he does  

<p> You're off the see the wizard, the Wonderful Wizard of Oz  

<p>  

<p>  

<p> (Scarecrow)  

<p> I could wile away the hours  

<p> Conferrin' with the flowers  

<p> Consultin' with the rain  

<p> And my head I'd be scratchin'  

<p> While my thoughts were busy hatchin'  

<p> If I only had a brain  

<p>  
 I'd unravel any riddle  

<p> For any individ'le  

<p> In trouble or in pain  

<p>  
 (Dorothy)  

<p> With the thoughts you'd be thinkin'  

<p> You could be another Lincoln  

<p> If you only had a brain  

<p>  
 (Scarecrow)  

<p> Oh, I would tell you why  

<p> The ocean's near the shore  

<p> I could think of things I never thunk before  

<p> And then I'd sit and think some more  

<p>  
 I would not be just a nuffin'  

<p> My head all full of stuffin'  

<p> My heart all full of pain  

<p> I would dance and be merry  

<p> Life would be a ding-a-derry  

<p> If I only had a brain  

<p>  

<p>  

<p> We're off to see the Wizard  

<p> The Wonderful Wizard of Oz  

<p> We hear he is a Whiz of a Wiz  

<p> If ever a Wiz there was

<p>  

<p>  

<p> (Tin Man)  

<p> When a man's an empty kettle  

<p> He should be on his mettle  

<p> And yet I'm torn apart  

<p> Just because I'm presumin'  

<p> That I could be kind of human  

<p> If I only had a heart  

<p>  
 I'd be tender, I'd be gentle  

<p> And awful sentimental  

<p> Regarding love and art  

<p> I'd be friends with the sparrows  

<p> And the boy that shoots the arrows  

<p> If I only had a heart  

<p>  
 Picture me a balcony  

<p> Above a voice sings low  

<p>  
 (Snow White)  

<p> Wherefore art thou, Romeo?  

<p>  
 (Tin Man)  

<p> I hear a beat, how sweet!  

<p>  
 Just to register emotion, jealousy, devotion  

<p> And really feel the part  

<p> I could stay young and chipper  

<p> And I'd lock it with a zipper  

<p> If I only had a heart  

<p>  

<p>  

<p> (Cowardly Lion)  

<p> Yeah, it's sad, believe me Missy  

<p> When you're born to be a sissy  

<p> Without the vim and verve  

<p> But I could show my prowess  

<p> Be a lion, not a mowess  

<p> If I only had the nerve  

<p>  
 I'm afraid there's no denyin'  

<p> I'm just a dandylion  

<p> A fate I don't deserve  

<p> I'd be brave as a blizzard  

<p>  
 (Tin Man)  

<p> I'd be gentle as a lizard  

<p>  
 (Scarecrow)  

<p> I'd be clever as a gizzard  

<p>  
 (Dorothy)  

<p> If the Wizard is a wizard who will serve  

<p>  
 (Scarecrow)  

<p> Then I'm sure to get a brain  

<p>  
 (Tin Man)  

<p> A heart  

<p>  
 (Dorothy)  

<p> A home  

<p>  
 (Cowardly Lion)  

<p> The nerve  

<p>  

<p>

<p> You're out of the dark  

<p> You're out of the night  

<p> Step into the sun, step into the light  

<p> Keep straight ahead  

<p> For the most glorious place  

<p> On the Face of the Earth  

<p> Or the sky  

<p>  
 Hold onto your breath  

<p> Hold onto your heart  

<p> Hold onto your hope  

<p> March up to the gate  

<p> And bid it open

<p> To match my gown?
