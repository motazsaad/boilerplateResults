<p>   The Old Edwardian Wargames Club held its annual doubles championships on the weekend of 7 and 8 September 2002 at the Old Edwardian Society in Lower Houghton. 

<p>The championship attracted the cream of South African figure gamers with a number of players who had received junior and senior national colours in the past three years attending the championship.  

<p>The championship is seen as one of the most important i terms of developing new players. 

<p>The rules of the championships dictates that senior players (or those who have represented South Africa in the past) have to team up with less experienced players.  

<p>Needless to say the championship is always a great deal of fun for the participants and is proving to be one of the most popular championships in South Africa. 

<p>The final top three positions were: 

<p>1st Thomas Huang and Colin Webster 

<p>2nd Nicholas Clare &amp; Matthew Strachan 

<p>3rd Gary Waterworth &amp; Marc Marais

<p>The South African Wargames Union held its annual KwaZulu Natal Championships on the weekend of 13 and 14 July 2002 at the Linpark High School, Boughton, Pietermaritzburg. 

<p>Once again the Old Edwardian Wargames Club dominated the figure gaming events. However, Simon Peckham (of Pietermaritzburg) managed to fight his way through to first place in a championship which in the past ten years has only been won by a Natalian once before, and by Old Edwardians eight times. 

<p>Another interesting development concerning the results is that the players selected to represent South Africa in March did not feature as well as expected. The improvement of younger players can only but bode well for the future of wargaming in South Africa. 

<p>13 &amp; 14 July 2002 

<p>The   KwaZulu Natal Provincial Wargames Championships   shall be held on 13 and 14 July 2002. 

<p>The event shall be played at the Linpark High School in Pietermaritzburg. 

<p>The championships shall start on both days at 9H00. The figure-games shall be played on both Saturday and Sunday, while Draughts and Morabaraba shall only be played on Sunday 14 July 2002. 

<p>In keeping with the South African Wargames Union’s policies re development programmes, and the sponsorship received from the   Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited  , all entries for Draughts and Morabaraba are free to the players who enter such championship. 

<p>Colin Webster   (  wargames@iafrica.com  ) shall be umpiring the KwaZulu Natal Championships. ALL entries (and army lists for figure gamers) must be submitted to Colin as soon as possible. 

<p>Should you require any additional information, please contact Colin Webster at 082 378 9829. 

<p>Yours faithfully

<p>Congratulations to Kevin Hoyle who finally tied the knot with his charming fianc&eacute; Ronelle. The club wishes Kevin and Ronelle all the best. 

<p>25 May 2002 

<p>A meeting is scheduled for Monday 3rd June 2002 at 17h30 in the Committee Room to discuss the development of the clubhouse. 

<p>Those Sub-Clubs who have not attended previous meetings are urged to attend, as it is important to get input from a broad spectrum of members. 

<p>17 May 2002 

<p>On 16 May 2002 the Old Edwardian Society held its annual Sportsman of the Year function. The ceremony was held to reward the exceptional sportsmen within the Old Edwardian Society who had represented South Africa at the highest levels during the 2001 season. 

<p>All the different sub-clubs, namely, Athletics, Basketball, Bowls, Cricket, Hockey (men and women), Rugby, Soccer, Swimming, Synchronised Swimming, Tennis, Waterpolo, and Wargames all had candidates that they had nominated for the ultimate accolades from the Society. 

<p>David Webster   who had represented South Africa since 1997 in international games and who came fifth in the 2001 Individual Wargames Championships was once again a finalist for the Sportsman of the year Award. 

<p>However, it was young   Matthew Strachan   who brought the silverware home when he was awarded the trophy for Junior Sportsman of the Year which he shares with Greg Smith who represented South Africa in the Under 19 Cricket team in India. 

<p>The award was awarded to Matthew in recognition of his sterling achievement in respect of his winning the Junior World Wargames Championships in 2001. 

<p>Wargames was to receive yet another accolade. For five years the Wargames club had been a finalist for the Best Sub Club award, but the award had always eluded the wargames club. The Cricket sub-club seemed to have an almost ironclad monopoly on the award. Thus the wargames section as most pleasantly surprised to be awarded the trophy for the Best Sub Club. 

<p>Club members who attended the function are: (from left to front) 

<p>Richard Ligault, Matthew Strachan, Vincent Lane, Kevin Hoyle, Colin Webster, Marc Marais, David Webster and Benji Shulman (in front) with the trophy 

<p>8 May 2002 

<p>PLEASE NOTE 

<p>The date for the Sportsman of the Year dinner has been changed to the   16th May 2002. 

<p>All players who were in a national team in 2001 are expected to be there.  

<p>Please RSVP. 

<p>13 January 2002 

<p>Please do not forget that on Sunday, 13 January 2002 we are holding our AGM at 11H00. 

<p>Players are welcome to send in nominations by Friday. 

<p>So far we have nominations for Colin Webster and Matthew Strachan. 

<p>This is your chance to make the club work the way you want it to..... 

<p>Please note that the club will hold a lunch for its members after the AGM that will be subsidised by the club by R5.00 per member. At such lunch, there will be the reading of the club joke etc. In spite of that much merriment shall be had. 

<p>Please RSVP by Friday evening.

<p>30 September 2001 

<p>The Old Edwardian wargames Club held its annual doubles championships on the weekend of 29 and 30 September 2001 at the Old Edwardian Society in Lower Houghton. 

<p>The championship attracted the cream of South African figure gamers with over 70% of all players who had received junior and senior national colours in the past three years attending the championship. In fact the championship showed a net growth of 50% of total entries compared to 2000. 

<p>With all the big names present, it was expected that the doubles pairs that included Kevin Hoyle and or David Webster would shine if not walk away with first place. 

<p>But it was not to be... 

<p>Few players expected the team comprising Matthew Strachan (2001 Junior World Champion) and Max Shabangu, of the Old Edwardian Wargames Club, to do quite so well.  

<p>Ever since Matthew attended the World Championships in Epsom in the UK in April this year his standard has improved beyond expectation. Notwithstanding his own success Matthew has taken the time and trouble to take newcomer Max Shabangu under his wing as part of a mentor system. 

<p>Needless to say, Max Shabangu began to improve in leaps and bounds. 

<p>The doubles team of Max Shabangu and Matthew Strachan went into the championship well trained and extremely well motivated. Whereas other doubles teams of the more experienced senior players failed to work efficiently, Max and Matthew immediately fell into sync and defeated one pair after another. Only the doubles pair of David Webster and Nicholas Clare managed to inflict a loss on Max and Matthew, a loss which came to late to stop Max and Matthew from romping home to take first place. 

<p>The final top three positions were: 

<p>1  st  Max Shabangu and Matthew Strachan 

<p>2  nd  Kevin Hoyle and Heloise Ehlers 

<p>3  rd  Vincent Lane and Andre Tonkin
