  Being able to understand what is said in English in many different situations is essential. There is no mystery here; the more you listen, the more you will understand. 

<p> However, many students complain that they don’t get enough opportunities to listen to spoken English. Well, wake up to the age of multimedia! Everything you need is on the internet and you can listen to whatever you want; songs, news, radio, sound tracks… 

<p> Some resources are especially for esl (English as a 2  nd   language) learners –   use them!   Once you become more confident, start listening to sources for native English speakers; you will be surprised at how quickly you can progress, provided you listen regularly of course. 

<p>Here are just a few examples of what is available:

<p>Voice of America (VOA), is an extensive site with lots of resources for listening. Several language versions are available.
