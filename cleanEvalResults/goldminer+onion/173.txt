<p>April 14, 2002 &#151; As normally conceived, loudspeakers use
 electrodynamic forces to control the movements of their diaphragms,
 which in turn move air. Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.,
 Ltd. has come up with an interesting twist on this principle,
 one in which air pressure itself ("aerodynamic-drive technology")
 is used to control the diaphragm. The result is a transparent
 panel speaker called the "Sound Window," announced by the Japanese
 industrial giant March 27.

<p>The invention is intended to mate acoustic radiating surfaces
 with video displays, enabling the launch of sound and image
 from the same surface&#151;or at least, from two closely-spaced
 surfaces&#151;thereby eliminating the need for the deep cavities
 required to house traditional moving-coil drivers. The goal
 is maximum performance with minimal energy expenditure from
 an integrated audio/video source with shallow depth&#151;in
 other words, a television-like device that can be hung on the
 wall like a framed picture.

<p>Sound Windows employ a lightweight transparent panel suspended
 a fraction of an inch from another surface, such as a video
 screen. The sound pressure from a small conventional cone driver
 acoustically vibrates the transparent panel, which can be 10
 times&#151;or more&#151;greater in diaphragm area. The aerodynamic-drive
 technology is said to ensure sound-pressure transmission to
 the entire panel surface. Matsushita claims this "acoustic leverage
 technology" enables the Sound Window to operate on as little
 as 1/25 the power a conventional driver would require. Panel
 shape isn't critical, the manufacturer states.

<p>With varying degrees of success, other manufacturers have experimented
 with flat-panel speakers. Matsushita claims that the Sound Window
 is the industry's first speaker "that reproduces sound by pneumatically
 vibrating a transparent panel using aerodynamic-drive technology."
 The device appears to offer the most promise for use in small
 communications products, such as cell phones, personal digital
 assistants, and laptop computers. The Sound Window's extremely
 low power consumption would appear to make it ideal for such
 applications. Matshushita plans to ship the first Sound Window
 products to industrial customers later this year.

<p>Matsushita doesn't specify the frequency response, distortion
 level, or output capability of the Sound Window. Presumably,
 none of these specifications is audiophile grade, but the ingenious
 device proves that new designs for sound generation are possible
 for inventors who think outside the box. A complete press release,
 including an operation diagram, can be seen here.
