<p> Switzerland has a healthy mix of small rural communities where
 cash is the sole method of payment, and international cities
 dedicated to the art of high finance, where anything will do
 nicely as long as it’s money. You’ll never be caught short –
 either for purchases or for cash withdrawals – if you carry
 your money in the form of only debit and/or credit cards, although
 the now rather pedantic travellers’ cheque still holds good.
 Switzerland is generally much safer than elsewhere in Europe,
 but carrying large wads of cash about is still not advisable.

<p> Most banks in the West keep Swiss francs on hand for over-the-counter
 exchange, and it’s a good idea to bring a small supply with
 you to cover first-night expenses in case of difficulties.
