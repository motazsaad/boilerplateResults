<p>An increasing number of countries require that foreigners be
 tested for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) prior to entry.
  It is usually required as part of a medical exam for long-term
 visitors, i.e. students and workers.  The following list of
 country requirements is based on information available as of
 March 2006 and is subject to change.  Before traveling abroad,
 check with the embassy of the country to be visited to learn
 about entry requirements and specifically whether AIDS testing
 is a requirement.  If the list indicates U.S. test results are
 acceptable and the word &#8220;Yes&#8221; appears with an asterisk
 beside it  (Yes*) in a particular country, prospective travelers
 should inquire at the embassy of that country for details (e.g.
 which laboratories in the United States may perform tests and
 where to have results certified and authenticated) before departing
 the United States.
