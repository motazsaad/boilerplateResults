<h>Following Protest, Coordinator Will Not Live at Senior House

<p>Residential coordinators will not live in Senior House next year,
 announced Dean for Student Life Larry G. Benedict at a meeting
 with concerned Senior House residents. 

<p>&#8220;There will be none of these people living at Senior House
 next year,&#8221; Benedict said at the Friday afternoon meeting
 amidst cheers from the audience. The coordinator slated to be
 housed in Senior House will instead live at Eastgate. 

<p>Assistant Dean for Residential Programs Katherine G. O&#8217;Dair
 said that it was impossible to house a residential coordinator
 in Senior House because the the space for the coordinator had
 already been promised to a handicapped student. 

<p>Coordinators will also live in Next House and NW30, the new dormitory
 for graduate students which will open in Fall 2001.

<p>Burton-Conner was also mentioned as a possible home for a residential
 coordinator. However, Burton-Conner president Kiwah K. Kendrick
 &#8217;02 said that the dormitory was unlikely to accept the
 proposal in its current state. Benedict and O&#8217;Dair will
 meet with Burton-Conner tomorrow.

<p>The Friday meeting was organized to deal with the negative student
 response to the residential coordinator proposal, which the
 deans announced earlier this month. About 75 students joined
 Benedict, O&#8217;Dair, Senior House Housemaster Henry Jenkins,
 and Director of Housing Operations Karen A. Nilsson for the
 discussion. 

<p>DSL will rewrite job description 

<p>Benedict and O&#8217;Dair also agreed to rewrite the job description
 for residential coordinators. &#8220;The language [in the original
 proposal] was atrocious,&#8221; Benedict said. 

<p>O&#8217;Dair added that coordinators would not be granted any
 disciplinary or judicial power. 

<p>Under the new proposal, residential coordinators will serve both
 graduate students and undergraduates, O&#8217;Dair said. 

<p>The original plan included one coordinator for all graduate students
 and three for the undergraduates.

<p>Deans address communication

<p>After announcing the new residential coordinator plans, Benedict
 and O&#8217;Dair addressed student complaints about ineffective
 communication between students and the administration. 

<p>Dormitory Council President Jeffrey C. Roberts &#8217;02 said
 he had known about the proposal as early as December. Dormcon
 didn&#8217;t inform the public of the status of the proposal
 because it felt it did not have enough details to advertise,
 said Dormcon Vice President Matthew S. Cain &#8217;02. &#8220;It
 was basically a big miscommunication,&#8221; Cain said. 

<p>Roberts added that when he was first informed, the proposal &#8220;was
 not a plan ... my expectation was that when it became a plan,
 [the dormitories involved] would be be the first to hear. We
 just had a breakdown in communication.&#8221; 

<p>The administration had also communicated with the Undergraduate
 Association and the Graduate Student Council, O&#8217;Dair said.
 

<p>&#8220;One thing we&#8217;ve learned is that we need to use multiple
 communication mechanisms, because as it is, the word doesn&#8217;t
 get out,&#8221; O&#8217;Dair said.

<p>Students prefer new proposal

<p>Most attendees at Friday&#8217;s meeting acknowledged that Benedict&#8217;s
 new proposal was an improvement. 

<p>Robin H. Ivester &#8217;01, who wrote the summary of student
 concerns provided to Benedict on Friday, said that Benedict&#8217;s
 appearance at the meeting helped rebuild students&#8217; trust
 in the administration.

<p>&#8220;I think what he did shows us very clearly that he&#8217;s
 willing to work with us, for us,&#8221; she said. 

<p>Other students commended the administration for responding to
 their concerns.

<p>&#8220;I was pretty pleased with the outcome of the meeting,&#8221;
 said Senior House resident M. Maitland Lederer &#8217;03. &#8220;I
 was glad to see communication [between students and administrators]
 and not just yelling and name-calling.&#8221;

<p>Lederer added that residential coordinators were &#8220;not a
 bad idea in principle&#8221; and that her main objections to
 the initial proposal were the original implementation plans
 and the wording. 

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s clear that Dean Benedict cares about the well-being
 of the students,&#8221; said Senior House resident Geoffrey
 L. Goodell &#8217;01.

<p>However, Goodell expressed reservations about the administration&#8217;s
 failure to provide students with a long-term plan. He added
 that, without seeing Benedict&#8217;s long-term vision, the
 residential coordinator plan seems &#8220;like a solution begging
 for a problem.&#8221; 

<p>Meanwhile, the GSC expressed its support for the new proposal.

<p>&#8220;Among grad students, we like the concept of having another
 person to help with residential life,&#8221; said GSC Housing
 and Community Affairs Chair Shunmugavelu D. Sokka. &#8220;Undergraduates
 have a lot of support already, but we favor any help we can
 get.&#8221; 

<p>Students draft bill of rights

<p>The controversy surrounding this proposal has inspired a group
 of students, led by Lederer, to create a &#8220;Students&#8217;
 Bill of Rights.&#8221; Currently in its early stages, the document
 outlines students&#8217; basic housing rights. 

<p>Lederer said the idea had been tossed around by the UA and other
 groups. &#8220;It&#8217;s not incredibly novel, but it&#8217;s
 something that hasn&#8217;t been done yet,&#8221; she said.
