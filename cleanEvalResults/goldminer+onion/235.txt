<p>What Membership Fees Will Pay For

<p>Short-Term Goals and Activities:Meet the costs of webcasting.
 Monthly costs of video and audio streaming, which will grow
 as our web traffic increases. Continued web site development.
 Upgrading this web site is critical to maintaining its function
 and attracting an audience. Bring you new programming, including
 more audio interviews, commentaries, and news as well as videos
 from others and our own video productions. The Endangered Languages
 Project, which will bring you the sounds and messages of languages
 threatened with extinction. Organize an Archaeological Field
 School for Teachers, to promote and assist in the use of archaeology
 as a classroom teaching tool. Work with partners, including
 teachers to develop and deliver school curricula through The
 Archaeology Channel. Write grant proposals to secure support
 for TAC programs and development. Hire two or three paid staff
 instead of relying completely on volunteer help. Buy a mini-DV
 video camcorder to play tapes for video capture and encoding
 and for shooting our own video footage. Send a representative
 to regional and national conferences to promote The Archaeology
 Channel and develop partnerships that will bring you valuable
 programming. 
Organize an Archaeological Film and Video Festival.
 We have already begun preliminary planning for this event, to
 be held in July of 2003. 

<p>Some Longer-term Goals and Activities:Establish a fund for sending
 a videographer to important discovery locations to capture footage
 you can see on The Archaeology Channel. Create virtual tours
 of important archaeological sites (e.g., Pompei, Stonehenge,
 Mesa Verde) for you to see on The Archaeology Channel. Set up
 webcams so you can watch ongoing archaeological excavations.
 Stream an indigenous-peoples radio station through The Archaeology
 Channel .
