<p>Architecture for Humanity is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization
 that seeks architectural solutions to humanitarian crises and
 brings design services to communities in need. For more information
 about our organization and our work, click on the links below.

<p>Architecture for Humanity is building a new space to collaborate
 online. The Open Architecture Network will be a gathering place
 for community designers and all those interested in improving
 the built environment. Here designers of all persuasions can
 post their projects, browse projects posted by others, comment
 and review projects, discuss relevant topics, contribute to
 shared resources, collaborate with each other and access project
 management tools to support their work. 

<p>We imagine a site that not only helps create, support and implement
 ideas, but also a place that fosters sustainable, replicable,
 adaptable and scalable design solutions. The network has a simple
 mission: to generate design opportunities that will improve
 living standards for all. 

<p>The Sapling Foundation is currently matching upwards of $125,000
 for the Open Architecture Network. and we are looking for your
 help to meet their challenge. To support the network, just type
 "Open Architecture" in the comments field when you make your

 number of volunteer groups working in the area to host a House

 Model Home program, a pilot program to provide design services
 and financial assistance for the construction of a number of
 new homes for families in East Biloxi whose houses were destroyed
 by Hurricane Katrina.
