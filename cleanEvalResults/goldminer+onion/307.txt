<p>CANADIAN justice minister Irwin Cotler tabled legislation to
 allow same-sex marriage in the House of Commons Tuesday. 

<p>If passed, Bill C-38 would redefine marriage as a "union between
 two persons." As a result, consequential amendments would also
 have to be made to the Canada Business Corporations Act, the
 Civilian War-related Benefits Act, the Divorce Act and the Income
 Tax Act. 

<p>"What will be the social effects of refashioning a fundamental
 social institution -- to marriage itself, to spouses, children
 and society?" responded Bruce Clemenger, president of the Evangelical
 Fellowship of Canada (EFC). "It is a sad day when the language
 of husband and wife is removed from federal legislation. Is
 this what Canadians want? It is a distorted notion of tolerance
 and respect that eclipses this distinctive relationship." 

<p>If the bill is passed, the Liberal government would not use the
 Constitution's notwithstanding clause to preserve the current
 definition of marriage, as between two people of the opposite
 sex. The notwithstanding clause allows the government to create
 laws that will operate in spite of some Charter rights that
 the laws appear to violate. Though these declarations last only
 five years, they can be re-enacted indefinitely. 

<p>Focus on the Family Canada president Terence Rolston said "there
 will be consequences" if the legislation goes through. "If passed,
 [this] experiment will be on the backs of our children," he
 said. "But God puts our governments into power and he is sovereign
 over them. I believe in the power of prayer. Now's the time
 for Canadian voices to be heard in the democratic process."
 

<p>Foreign affairs minister Pierre Pettigrew has said that churches
 and other faith-based organizations should not intervene in
 matters of government and that Canadians need to "distinguish
 between civil and religious marriage." 

<p>Responding to Pettigrew's remarks, Rolston said, "How marriage
 is recognized is important as to how society values the institution
 of marriage. The law should underline and support the institution
 that God ordained. It is a covenant." 

<p>Janet Epp Buckingham, director of law and public policy at EFC,
 said more than 75 percent of marriages in Canada are performed
 by clergy. 

<p>"It is clearly a deeply religious constitution," she explains.
 "It is naive and impossible to say that you can change civil
 marriage without it having an impact on religious marriage and
 religious institutions." 

<p>Gilles Marchildon, executive director of Egale Canada, a gay
 and lesbian rights group, said it is a "dangerous blurring of
 the lines" between church and state "when any faith wants its
 view of the world and its view for its own institutions imposed
 on society at large." 

<p>But Rolston disagreed. "This is one of the most significant issues
 to hit the government in the past 30 years. We do live in a
 free and democratic country. We have the opportunity to vote
 and be involved in the democratic process. We shouldn't neglect
 the freedom of speaking out here for the truth of God's word,
 proclaiming it to those in authority." 

<p>Bill C-38 does state that "officials of religious groups are
 free to refuse to perform marriages that are not in accordance
 with their religious beliefs." However, since only provincial
 governments have the authority to legislate protection of religious
 freedom to the solemnization of marriage, Buckingham said this
 issue is "a political football" being tossed between the federal
 and provincial governments. 

<p>"We have not seen any action by the provincial governments to
 protect religious freedom," she says. "Churches and religious
 institutions are being set up for endless court cases." 

<p>The Vancouver Chinese Evangelical Ministerial Fellowship, representing
 95 Chinese Christian churches that includes 25,000 individuals,
 released a declaration opposing the bill January 28. 

<p>The declaration stated that "changing the tradition of marriage
 in the manner proposed by the Federal Government goes against
 the intention of God's creation and it runs counter to the moral
 traditions deeply held by Chinese and people from other ethnic
 backgrounds . . . the government has no right to ignore the
 will of the people in order to be politically correct."

<p>Polygamy: a challenge to multicultural fans
The homosexual lobby
 and its allies insist that same-sex marriage can't possibly
 lead to polygamy, because, you see, gay sex is legal but polygamy
 is forbidden by the Criminal Code. How stuffy. How arrogant.
 That might be the gay lobby's view. That might be the lofty
 liberal-left view. That might be the columnists' view. But they
 aren't the ones who would decide whether to launch a constitutional
 challenge. That would be the polygamists' decision.

If any Canadian cabinet
 minister were to announce that all citizens who believe in God

 is, in other words, unthinkable. Yet a senior Canadian cabinet

<p>Defining marriage is a job for Parliament
In 1982, Canada's legal
 system was fundamentally changed by the adoption of the Charter
 of Rights and Freedoms. Before that time, Parliament and the
 provinces, acting pursuant to the jurisdiction granted under
 the British North America Act of 1867, were legislatively supreme.
 Although the courts did have the authority to strike down legislation,
 their right to do so extended only to situations in which a
 particular legislature strayed into the jurisdiction assigned
 to another.

<p>A perverse vision of church-state relations
I expect the irony
 was lost on him. The Liberal Cabinet having just returned from
 a lengthy Asian tour, Foreign Minister Pierre Pettigrew announced
 that religious leaders should not involve themselves in the
 gay marriage debate. The Prime Minister had just been chatting
 up the gay marriage issue in India and China. The government
 enthusiastically wants to talk about gay marriage, even overseas,
 but thinks that Canadians should shut up about it at home. Or
 more to the point of Mr. Pettigrew's remarks, that Catholic
 bishops should keep silent. "I find that the separation of church
 and the state is one of the most beautiful inventions of modern
 times," said Mr. Pettigrew. The authoritarians of China do not
 find the invention quite so fetching; their aesthetic judgment
 favours a different modern invention -- communism. And they
 have more effective ways of silencing their bishops: putting
 them in jail.
