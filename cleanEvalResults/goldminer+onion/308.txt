<h>The U.S.-Venezuela Oil Split Approaches A Boiling Point

<p>Although Venezuela has long been one of the U.S.’s top four foreign
 suppliers of crude, relations between the two countries have
 grown quite acrimonious since the Bush administration’s tacit
 support of the failed coup against populist president Hugo Chavez
 in April of 2002. How the Bush administration has been dealing
 with Caracas repeats a well-known cycle to any student of U.S./Latin
 American relations: support of overt or covert coups against
 democratically-elected regimes eventually ignites a backlash
 of popular support for the embattled government against the
 “imperialist gringos.” This is likely to motivate Washington
 to even more aggressively back its favored opposition, generating
 an even stronger wave of popular backlash.

<p>The crucial difference between the recent U.S. support of the
 middle-class opposition in Venezuela – mainly through the National
 Endowment for Democracy (NED) and the U.S. Agency for International
 Aid (USAID) – versus its earlier backing of the Somoza, Batista,
 Duvalier and Pinochet dictatorships, is that Washington can
 ill afford to antagonize the populist government from which
 it receives anywhere between 11% and 15% of its imported petroleum.
 This is one situation where Washington simply cannot risk an
 oil crisis for the sake of indulging the administration’s numerous
 nostalgic cold warriors, like Assistant Secretary of State Roger
 Noriega and Undersecretary of State John Bolton. But despite
 the Bush administration’s tacit support of the 2002 coup and
 the substantial funds that the NED poured into the failed recall
 referendum last August, Chavez has, so far, not given any indication
 that he intends to cut petroleum exports to the U.S. He did,
 however, tell Washington to not "even think about trying something
 similar in Venezuela," referring to what he claims was Washington’s
 orchestrated coup against former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand
 Aristide in February, 2004. Should the U.S. follow this course,
 he optimistically observed that Venezuela “has enough allies
 on this continent to start a 100-year war," and that "U.S. citizens
 could forget about ever getting Venezuelan oil."

<p>Enter the Dragon
 In December 2004, President Chavez met with
 his Chinese counterpart, Hu Jintao, in Beijing to discuss a
 new bilateral agreement regarding access to Venezuela’s energy
 market. Under the agreement, which Chavez pushed because, in
 his words, “this is what is needed in the world in order to
 break with unilateralism.” As a result, Caracas will help Beijing
 with additions to the latter’s strategic oil reserves in exchange
 for Chinese investment in Venezuela’s agricultural sector and
 the development of fifteen currently shut down oil fields. This
 meeting was preceded by Chavez’s renewed calls for the creation
 of PetroSur, a Latin American version of OPEC. In an interview
 with IPS, political scientist Alberto Garrido, of the University
 of Los Andes, reasoned that Chavez “is trying to give a regional,
 Latin American dimension to his Bolivarian revolution, as reflected
 in documents from his movement that date back to far before
 he made it to power.”

<p>This dimension cannot simply be chalked up to the Chavistas’
 heady nationalistic rhetoric or to Chavez’s frequent cheeky
 barbs against Washington. Rather, Chavez likely sees such a
 block as a defensive bulwark against any conceivable future
 U.S. intervention against him as well as a means of gaining
 the kind of steely international leverage that has been famously
 found in OPEC. Garrido continued, Venezuela “is not only buying
 Russian weapons to free itself from military dependence on Washington,
 but the government is also trying to get Venezuelans ready for
 a possible scenario of confrontation, as reflected by (Chavez's)
 recent calls to prepare the reserve.”

<p>Chavez’s Brinkmanship
 None of this can be welcome news to Washington
 policymakers who are having increasing difficulty finding, or
 even maintaining, stable sources of oil. With al-Qaeda attacks
 in Saudi Arabia, the insurgents’ continuing sabotage of Iraqi
 and Colombian pipelines, and civil unrest in Nigeria, U.S. oil
 managers can only get more desperate in their search for reliable
 petro exports. With the largest proven oil reserves in the Western
 Hemisphere (77.8 billion barrels), bilateral deals with China,
 and an attractive six-day transport time to U.S. ports – as
 opposed to five weeks from the Middle East – Chavez is forcing
 Washington to take a more protracted look south. Whether the
 volatile Venezuelan leader is playing a reckless game with Washington
 that could get him swatted, or is adroitly acting in his country’s
 best interests, is a question that could be explosively answered
 in a relatively short period.

<p>Evocations of the Monroe Doctrine
 In 2003, China surpassed Japan
 as the world’s second largest oil consumer. Given that by 2025
 China’s net oil imports are projected to be 9.4 million barrels
 per day (bbl/d), the U.S. Energy Information Agency predicts
 that by 2030 China will be importing as much oil as the U.S.
 is currently (11.8 million bbl/d). With its energy consumption
 expected to double in the next decade, China is looking into
 markets that traditionally have supplied most of their crude
 to the U.S. Though Beijing has no choice but to attempt to sate
 its country’s skyrocketing petro demands, the China problem,
 from Washington’s view, is that any increase in Beijing’s dependence
 on Caracas invariably cuts into one of its few remaining, relatively
 stable sources of crude. Ironically, then, Washington must either
 throw many carrots at Caracas, or use a very big stick against
 it.

<p>Drawing a bead on the largest Western Hemispheric reserves would
 certainly represent a dicey move on Beijing’s part. Moreover,
 China’s recent initiative towards Venezuela comes at a time
 when Beijing has just recently indicated that it has similar
 designs on Canadian oil markets that today are dominated by
 the U.S. In other words, not only is Beijing poking its nose
 in ‘our backyard,’ but Washington’s front yard as well. The
 New York Times reported on December 23, 2004 that, according
 to Murray Smith, a former Alberta energy minister, “The China
 outlet would change our dynamic. Our main link would still be
 with the U.S., but this would give us multiple markets and competition
 for a prized resource." How will Washington view Beijing’s initiative
 towards the US’s largest source of oil imports? The same Times
 story cited Calgary’s The National Post, which pithily editorialized,
 “Watch the Americans have a hissy fit if a Chinese incursion
 materializes . . . So far, the Americans have taken Canada's
 energy for granted.”

<p>Thus, the immediate short-term problem facing Washington from
 the Caracas/Beijing axis is two-fold; on the one hand, it cannot
 allow China to get too cozy with one of its closest suppliers,
 which may provoke Washington to exhume the Monroe Doctrine.
 On the other hand, Washington’s current policy of siding with
 the anti-Chavez opposition risks the very outcome Washington
 seeks to avoid; pushing Caracas into Beijing’s arms or precipitating
 an anti-Washington embargo. Given the seemingly unstoppable
 popularity of Chavez, who has, to date, won two presidential
 elections and a referendum – all with comfortable majorities
 – the first sensible thing Washington must do is cease its open
 courting of the opposition. After all, how would Washington
 policymakers feel if French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin
 spent millions of euros in support of a domestic opposition
 in the U.S., whose stated goal was the removal of President
 Bush from office?

<p>If the NED intends to live up to its own charter, then it has
 to stop backing the egregiously undemocratic, even authoritarian
 methods of the opposition. Claiming that Chavez “must die like
 a dog because he deserves it,” former president and would-be
 leader of the opposition, Carlos Andres Perez, revealed his
 reverence for democratic ideals in an interview with the Caracas
 daily El Nacional last July: "We can't just get rid of Chavez
 and immediately have a democracy... we will need a transition
 period of two or three years to lay the foundations for a state
 where the rule of law prevails . . . When Chavez falls, we must
 shut down the National Assembly (Congress) and also the Supreme
 Court.”

<p>Kissinger Redux?
 Though Secretary of Donald Defense Rumsfeld
 has most likely managed to exhaust the offensive capacity of
 the US military for the foreseeable future, it would behoove
 the increasingly feisty Chavez to review the recently declassified
 British intelligence document of December 13, 1973 entitled
 “Middle East – Possible Use of Force by the United States.”
 The Foreign Office memo cited a warning by former Secretary
 of Defense James R. Schlesinger to the British ambassador in
 Washington, Lord Cromer, that the administration would not tolerate
 threats from “under-developed, under-populated” countries. As
 noted by The Washington Post in January of 2004, Kissinger later
 wrote in his memoir, Years of Upheaval: “These were not empty
 threats. I ordered a number of studies from the key departments
 on countermeasures against Arab members of OPEC if the embargo
 continued. By the end of the month, several contingency plans
 had been completed.” Given that the U.S. annually imports as
 much or more oil from Venezuela as from Riyadh, Chavez should
 be well advised that any talk of an embargo could trigger a
 U.S. military intervention. He may risk setting the stage for
 this possibility if he is perceived by Washington as being too
 nettlesome in setting up a new OPEC, or if he gets too close
 to Beijing for Washington’s comfort.

<p>Some analysts are already predicting a global clash between the
 U.S. and China over oil reserves that could trigger a veritable
 casus belli. As stated by Gal Luft, executive director of the
 Institute for the Analysis of Global Security, in a recent editorial
 in The Los Angeles Times, “Without a comprehensive strategy
 designed to prevent China from becoming an oil consumer on par
 with the U.S., a superpower collision is in the cards.” Dr.
 Luft suggests the U.S. do everything it can to shift China in
 the direction of non-petro based energy supplies, such as hydrogen
 or natural gas. However, barring such a spectacular advance
 in the technology of harvesting hydrogen fuel cells or the like,
 China will need to look anywhere it can in order to satisfy
 its petro consumption demand.

<p>So far, neither Chinese nor U.S. authorities have, at least publicly,
 anticipated anything like a global clash over energy sources.
 Reported by Stephanie Ho of AXcess News, Chinese Embassy spokesman
 Sun Weide said, "Of course, as our two economies continue to
 grow, we both need reliable and, I think, affordable energy
 supplies... So, there is very good basis for cooperation between
 the two countries." But such optimism belies the fact that Washington
 is facing an almost certain intrusion into its oil markets by
 the world’s second largest petro importer. Though Beijing will
 somehow have to satisfy its energy demand, which grows annually
 at 7.5%, Washington will not look kindly on any such incursion
 into its traditional oil suppliers. As observed by Luft in The
 New York Times, "China's gone after the low-hanging fruit so
 far. Now they're entering another level of ambition, in places
 such as Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and Canada that are well within
 the American sphere."

<p>Washington could begin repairing its frayed relationship with
 Caracas by supporting what is bound to be a growing oil-based
 alliance between Caracas and Beijing. Given the near inevitability
 of this new alliance, Washington would be foolish to obstruct
 China’s economic growth by trying to dictate to Chavez where
 he can and cannot sell his country’s oil. Furthermore, just
 as many U.S. public figures are demanding that their government
 reduce its imports of Middle East oil, so too are Venezuelans
 urging Chavez to reduce his country’s traditional reliance on
 the U.S.'s oil consumption. Now that China is offering Chavez
 just that opportunity, the question is, will Washington tolerate
 a Sino-Venezuelan petro pact or begin dusting off the Monroe
 Doctrine?

<p>Note: With China now making moves in the Canadian energy sector,
 it is important that we know the larger issues at hand. They
 will all play off one another.

<p> I don't find it surprising at all that America might find a
 problem with a potential adversary seeking out oil in what America
 deems to be its backyard. Yet, as China continues to modernize,
 we should expect some type of conflict over what oil is left.
 Not neccessarily war, but certainly some animosity between the
 two.

<p>
 As for Venezuala, they are just looking out for themselves.
 Besides, what a better way to stick it to America than to form
 partnerships with countries like China? Chavez of course was
 almost deposed because of an American backed coup attempt. Only
 one nation accepted the leaders of the coup - America. The people
 obviously want to continue with Chavez as he has won in a fair
 open election, and in a referendum on his actions. His country
 has been exporting oil for 100 years and its only now that the
 people in the countryside as starting to benefit. That is surely
 going to chaff the elites of the nation that were so used to
 getting the vast majority of the oil wealth for themselves only.

<p>
 Canada too may draw the ire of the US if we too open up to
 the Chinese. Canada is a central part to the US policy on energy
 security and Chinese involvement certainly threatens that hegemony
 to some level. 

<p>oops forgot to mention a possible error in the article - Canada
 with the oil sands has by some estimates over 1 trillion barrels
 of oil which is far more than Venezuela.

<p> This article is standard Anglo nationalist propaganda. Despite
 its token criticisms of American hegemony, the underlying thrust
 of the article displays the chauvnistic hostility which Western
 and Anglo Imperialist nations like the USA or Canada instinctively
 spew whenever they are challenged by any upstart Third World
 country. In this case, the targets are China and Venezuela.

<p>
 I love how the author implicitly invokes the standard Yellow
 Peril hysteria over China "intruding" into the Western hemisphere
 in quest of energy resources. (See the rhetoric about "Enter
 the Dragon" for example or how China has "similar designs on
 Canadian oil markets" or that "Beijing [is] poking its nose
 in ‘our backyard.") Anglo American chauvinism dies hard, it
 seems--despite its multicutural or "democratic" pretenses.

<p>
 Why the hell shouldn't Venezuela sell its oil to whomever it
 pleases? Apparently, North Americans implicitly believe that
 Venezuelan oil actually belongs to the USA or Canada, and that
 Venezuela should accept the benign tutelage of the Great White
 North in terms of its oil deals. 

<p>
 And whatever happened to your propaganda about "free market
 competition"? Why shouldn't China buy what oil it can on the
 open market. If China offers a better deal to Venezuela on this
 market, Venezuela should sell them the oil by all means. And
 if Canada doesn't want to sell oil to China, then don't do it.
 Perhaps, China should decide to stop buying Canadian exports,
 and better yet expel Canada and its designs out of China/Asia
 where Canada is sticking its own noise. 

<p>
 The USA, Canada, and other Western Imperialist nations are
 always lecturing the Third World about the benefits of free
 market competition--only of course when it benefits themselves
 and doesn't challenge their precious security interests. 

<p>
 To be blunt, North America's "security interests" can go to
 hell. These so-called interests are about maintaining Anglo-American
 domination and hegemony over Latin America (what the author
 glibly dismisses as "imperialist gringos") and indeed the world--and
 hence have NO legitimacy to exist.

<p>
 BTW, the oil coalition between Venezuela and China is but part
 of a broader phenomon in which Third World and non-Western nations
 (like Russia) are moving to form economic and strategic alliances
 to oppose Anglo-American and Western hegemony. Russia, for example,
 is not only developing weapons deals with Venezuela but is working
 to create a global alliance involving Brazil, Russia, India,
 and China (called BRIC) to oppose Anglo-American domination
 and power.

<p>
 Their vision is for a multipolar world against the bankrupt
 unipolar system currently dominated by the USA, Canada, and
 the West.

<p>
 So if you all want to cry and piss in your pants about this
 Venezulean oil pact, you ain't see nothing yet. Your Anglo American
 axis which unfortunately subjugates and exploits most of this
 planet is coming to an end. Get used to it.

<p> I believe it is in Canada's longer-term interests to diversify
 its economy as much as possible in every area, and somehow end
 the present pathetic dependence on United States markets. We
 are not a soverign nation if the lives and well being of our
 citizens can be controlled by the economic decisions of a foreign
 government, any foreign government, into which we have no democratic
 input. And make no mistake, that is what is happening today.
 Thus, a Chinese (or any other) foray into our oil patch is probably
 good news for us if it develops properly. Competition is always
 good.

<p>
 Having said that, I do not share the negative feelings of many
 other writers towards the US. It is true that both the domestic
 and foreign policies of the present US administration are appalling.
 But administrations come and go, and it may be too early to
 write off America and the American dream yet. The US was a beacon
 to the world for a long time and may yet be again some day.
 

<p>
 Our problem is that we give too much and get too little in
 return. Our trade deals like the NAFTA are horribly loaded against
 us. I would never object to trading with our neighbour in any
 commodity, energy included, if they left us alone to structure
 our economy and society the way most of us want it, treated
 us with more respect at the border, and gave us the guaranteed
 access to all those markets in the US that we want to enter.
 None of that is happening today. The blame lies with us. Weak,
 compromised governments, far to the political right of reason,
 look and act like US patsies, and thoughtlessly sacrifice basic
 Canadian values for next to nothing. We need to stop blaming
 everything on the US and look inward. We need far better government,
 and we should get on with the job of finding it. Venezuala,
 at least to some degree, seems to have accomplished that already.
 

<p> I totally agree, Canada must diversify its export markets. We
 rely far too much on America for our markets. Though, we should
 hold ourselves to certain standards when it comes to just who
 we trade with.

<p>
 While we already trade with China, should we trade more when
 they don't respect democracy and human rights? 

<p> That is laughable. This statement shows the Moral arrogance
 of Western Imperialist nations through and through. 

<p>
 Since when has Canada or the USA ever respected "democracy
 and human rights"--except as a cynical political lie? 

<p>
 IT is the USA, Canada and other Western "democracies" that
 are/have been busy raping, colonizing, and subjgating nations
 like Iraq, Afghanistan, or Yugoslavia--all under the lie of
 promoting "democracy and human rights."

<p>
 "Democracy and human rights" are nothing more than a poltiical
 cover which the West hides behind in order to justify their
 wars of aggression as well as economic exploitation (i.e. Globalization)
 of vast swathes of humanity.

<p>
 As for the Canada and the USA relationship, you Canadians haven't
 figured out yet that you are nothing more than Uncle Sam's well-kept
 *****. Under the cover of "deep integration" as well as expansion
 of the USA's Northcom military system to include Canada, you
 have given up your "sovereignty" a long time ago. 

<p>the takeover you speak about is not yet complete, but yes it
 is happening. those actions you speak of - yes they happen,
 but there are those of us fighting it so that we may all win.

<p> Hello, While this reply may be late in coming to the contents
 of this article I must say for anybody reading in future (I
 found this article through a search cached copy) to offer up
 another point that I have found to be a re-occuring source of
 concern for me. 

<p> The vitriolic commentary about Canada's alliance with the US,
 referred to as the 'Anglo American Axis' in the closing paragraph,
 I must comment as a Canadian. 

<p> While there is a very real concern by Canadians AND other countries
 and cultures in regards to the hunger for petroleum coming from
 the U.S., that there seems to be a rather disproportionate bias
 towards the perception of events being manipulated by English-speaking
 'Anglos' for domination of the global econmies. 

<p> Certainly the public images of the U.S. especially, and of Canada
 can be viewed that way; However, it at the same time totally
 denigrates and dismisses the VERY large proportion of Asian,
 East Asian, Black (Whether of West Indian or African direct
 relation), Middle Eastern and French-speaking Caucasians that
 DO have a voice in Canada and the U.S. and DO have a DIRECT
 input into the policies and laws that are put in practice by
 the Canadian and U.S. governments. 

<p> Canada especially has long prided itself on multi-culturalism,
 to the point where it is taken for granted as a basis for society
 in Canada and in it's cities and the lifestyles of the populations
 therein. 

<p> This additionally is reflected within the U.S. as well, that
 can be best seen in major cities such as San Francisco and New
 York. 

<p> To ignore the influence and wishes of such mixed populaces is
 at the peril of anyone looking to offer up any simplified ideals
 of an authoritarian 'Anglo' North America. 

<p> The U.S. certainly may be VISIBLY directed by predominately
 English speaking Caucasians, it ignores the vast numbers of
 Blacks, Asians and LATINS (Hispanic being the un-official second
 tongue to learn in the U.S.) that support their governments
 actions and policies. 

<p> One final point to consider that many seem to forget or overlook,
 is that Canada's physcial and subsequent diplomatic position
 in relation to the U.S. 

<p> Canada's large size while impressive on a map, does not really
 give an accurate view proportionately to the size of it's population
 (32,078,819) versus that of the U.S.(295,996,538 ), and the
 amount influence it can conceivably bear upon the U.S. By way
 of comparison, New York City (8,085,742.) alone has 40% of Canada's
 population. 

<p> Such an extreme disproportion of power residing south of Canada's
 border obviously has to play a significant part of any decision
 making process that goes on in Canada, and in turn, must be
 taken into account when viewing Canada's actions on the world
 stage. 

<p> However, Canada, as an ally of the U.S., does not immediately
 confer acceptance or condoning of U.S. government policies,
 actions or statements. 

<p> It is, like any other government outside of the U.S., is an
 distinct and seperate governing body that was selected by it's
 populance for the direction and well-being of their chosen country.
 

<p> In other words, Canada think's for itself, like any other country
 would, and does the best it can for itself and it's peoples,
 again, like any other country would. 

<p> Lumping Canada and it's peoples, languages and beliefs into
 a 'Anglo' pot with the U.S. all of its' peoples, doesn't accomplish
 anything other than to serve to muddy the waters of clear thought
 and promote ignorance. 

<p> Thank-You, 

<p> An Anglic-descended Caucasian.
