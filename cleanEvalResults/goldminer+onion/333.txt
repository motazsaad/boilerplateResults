<p>Back to the GardenOur task is neither to shield nature from humanity
 nor to tame all wilderness.A Christianity Today editorial

<p>The heat continued long after the fires went out. Who was to
 blame for the fires that tarnished the Golden State? Those blazes
 killed 22 residents, destroyed 3,600 homes, and burned over
 750,000 acres. What could we do to stop it from happening again?

 other Christians have taken another extreme. "In God's law neither
