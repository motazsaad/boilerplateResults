<p>Best Rib Roast12/31/2005 at 07:01pmUser:Bob from Chesterfield,

 Alton Brown is the true food scientist,

<p>Absolutely Wonderful!12/31/2004 at 12:53amUser:ERIC from Iola,

 I made and served this at a dinner party
 tonight. This was the first time that I made a "prime rib".
 I did follow the procedure in the TV program by purchasing a
 4 rib "choice" standing rib roast and had my butcher cut off
 the bones. Instead of using a pot to cover the roast I placed
 a stone baking sheet both below and above the roast in the oven.
 I also cooked this a bit longer, removing from the oven at 120,
 letting stand until 130, then taking into the crusting stage.
 I cut and served the roast once it was past 145. I served this
 with Alton's garlic mashed potatoes and Emeril's horseradish
 cream sauce as well as the sage sauce. Again a wonderful dinner
 for 5 adults and 5 children. I will make this one again.

 It took me several days to find the right
 pot, but in the end it was the most fantastic piece of meat.
 It was my first attempt at a large piece of meat (10 pounds).
 I was a little worried in the beginning about the temp not rising
 fast enough but at almost exactly 4 hours, the digital temp
 was 118. I pulled it out, took off the lid and covered with
 foil. About 25 minutes later, the alarm went off on the thermometer
 at 130. The rest is history. Talk about fantastic. My Christmas
 dinner was a great success. Thank you sir.

 Slow cooking the roast, after the
 aging, made it juicy and wonderful. It would be helpful, though,
 to have an idea of how many minutes per pound to allow for cooking.
 Our dinner was delayed because I hadn't timed it properly! If
 that were available, I'd give it 5 stars.

 I thought this prime rib tasted great. It was juicy and flavorful,
 and best of all - easy! The only issue that I have with the
 recipe concerns that cooking temp/time. After taking the roast
 out of the oven when it reaches 118 degrees, how is it supposed
 to reach 130 degrees? I understand that the foil will contain
 the heat and continue the cooking process, however how is it
 supposed to actually increase the temperature??? I think this
 had something to do with the extreme rareness of the roast,
 so I'm wondering what others may have differently? (I happen
 to love rare beef, but some of my guests unfortunately didn't.)
 Just wondering, how crucial do you think the clay pot is? The
 ease of this recipe is slightly affected by having to lug a
 fairly heavy terra cotta pot into the oven.

<p>A couple of Observations12/28/2004 at 05:43pmUser:JANE from Atlanta,
 GA    User Rating:
 My first time with this recipe, but I got
 raves for Christmas dinner. Here is an observation on the heat
 to help the next cook: 1) Since I cook on a vintage 1936 Magic
 Chef, I used both an electronic oven temp gauge and a meat thermometer.
 Even though I kept the oven temp turned to the required 200
 degrees, the oven temp was registering at 300 degrees -- probably
 due to the clay pot holding heat. This meant that the meat cooked
 a lot faster than I expected. Don't know if this is "right"
 or not, but the end result was fantastic, so it probably doesn't
 matter. 2) I expected the roast to end up medium rare, but it
 was very rare, even though I followed the temps exactly. This
 seems to be the experience of some of the other cooks here.
 I'm going to try it again and see what happens.

 I cooked the meat to 130 degrees, let it rest for about
 10 minutes while oven heated to 500 degrees. Then I cooked it
 to internal temp of 145 degrees for a medium rare/medium roast.
 It was perfect! I might cook it to 125 & 140 degrees next time
 for more of a medium rare finished product. I have been cooking
 rib roast every Christmas for 6 years and this was the best
 one yet for nice crisp crust. Also, very few juices in the pan
 - all were in the meat!

 I skipped the dry aging and planter processes.
 I just followed the temperatures of the oven and meat temps.
 I put the roast in at 10:30 and it was done by 3:30 (if that
 helps with timing) using a 3 bone roast. It turned out perfectly
 medium rare throughout. I made an Au Jus without the pan drippings
 (1 cup of wine, 2 cups of beef stock, salt and pepper) and it
 tasted fine without the drippings.

<p>"Aged" was right...but not for the beef!12/26/2006 at 12:40amUser:David
 from Chandler, AZ    User Rating:
 The results were delicious,
 but the roast took FOREVER! I finally gave up after more than
 8 hours. I wanted the beef medium (rather than medium rare).
 It took almost 7 hours to get to 118; I finally took it out
 of the oven at about 130. After its final crusting, it eventually
 reached 145, which was perfect for my taste--still quite pink,
 but not red. I'm not sure why it took so long: was the clay
 pot I was using too heavy? Was the roast too cold (it essentially
 went from the fridge into the oven, and the thermometer started
 out at 32 degrees!)? The pot I used had a dark interior--was
 that the problem? The roast was tied--did that affect the cooking
 time? We were quite pleased with the texture, taste, and appearance
 of the finished roast, but Christmas dinner after 9 p.m. was
 NOT part of the plan! Next time I make this (and I will make
 it again), I will bring the roast to room temp before putting
 it in the oven, and I will probably dispense with the clay pot.

 I was really unsure of the dry aging thing,
 convinced I was going to poison us, but I followed this exactly
 and I stunned my own self with how utterly perfect this roast
 turned out. My people went crazy for it. It was perfectly rare,
 almost fork tender and absolutely juicy. I had no leftovers!
 They even ate the bones! Alton, I should never have doubted

 This
 is some awesome prime rib, and really not hard to do at all.
 And don't let the dry aging thing scare you, it's easy and makes
 a big difference in the end result. I deviated a little by heating
 the roast to 127 F before pulling it out of the pot (which took
 about 5 hours). After the high heat sear and a 40 min rest,
 it turned out a perfect medium rare. I could only find a 14"
 azalea pot in my area...which makes a big difference when you're
 trying to find a baking dish that will fit underneath. I ended
 up buying a inexpensive 12" stainless steel skillet and sawing
 the handle off...which fit perfectly. It also worked well when
 making the jus afterwards. But yeah, make this and your "kitchen
 timid" friends will think you're a master chef =)

 I have to admit, I'm not a
 huge fan of Alton. A few weeks ago, we happened to catch this
 episode. We watched it because I always cook rib roast for Christmas.
 The past few years, I have cooked it at low heat using a slightly
 different recipe. It was definitely better than the higher heat
 method. But we had never aged the meat or crisped it at the
 end. I only aged it 2 days. I didn't do the clay pot -- just
 my roasting pan. Hands down, this was the best rib roast I have
 ever cooked. After reading all the reviews here, I left it in
 to 125? instead of the 118. Then let it rest to a little over
 130. Then I crisped it. The roast was done to perfection. Absolutely
 fabulous. This recipe is a winner! I will never cook it any
 other way.

 When the roast goes back in for a crisping

 Xmas this year, but don't want to mess up and need to know a

 Growing up with a chef dad, I never thought
 I'd be able to top his holiday roast. That belief was shattered
 when I served this roast last year. My family is still talking
 about how delicious and flavorful it was. Prep time - if you
 have limited fridge space, it may be a bit inconvenient. Digital
 probe thermometer - the one I have is good in terms of functionality,
 but can be technically challenging. Just make sure you take
 the time to read the directions over before delving into the
 project. If you do not have this set properly, it will mean
 the end of your meal.

 I used a 2 rib roast instead of a 4 rib. I think b/c
 the roast was smaller, it didn't carry over as much heat. I
 took the roast out at 118 degrees, but it only carried over
 to 125. Next time I use a smaller roast, I'll probably let it
 go to about 123 degrees before taking it out of the oven. I
 also used a roast that was already dry aged (can't beat the
 NYC butcher shops), so not too much moisture came out of it
 in the fridge. All in all - outstanding...even without the flower
 pot. Probe therometer is a must!

 You may need to adjust the temps though.
 Instead of pulling out the roast at 118 I pulled it out at 125
 and it only heated to 129 and stopped. I blasted at 500 for
 about 18 minutes. When I took it out I took the temperature
 and it got up to 150. The center cuts were pretty rare. I liked
 it that way but next time I'll keep it in the oven at 200 until
 it gets up to 130 degrees. I made the Au Juise and it was great
 I also used the fat to make Yorkshire Pudding which was a great
 side dish for this meal. Then I used the bones and made beef
 soup. Today I had a prime rib sandwich on an onion roll for
 lunch. This cut of meat may be expensive but I was able to make
 so many things out of. Best of all the kids asked for thirds!!

 Absolutely a fantastic recipe. The best
 rib roast I've ever had, including some top notch steakhouses.
 A few things to consider, though. Firstly, the clay pot is not
 strictly necessary, but the even heat from all sides ensures
 the meat all gets done at the same time. This is the real strength
 of this recipe...uniform doneness all the way through, top to
 bottom, side to side. In higher temp recipes, the outer ring
 of filet meat(which is the best part) is always way overdone.
 With this recipe it was perfectly medium rare with a small 1/4
 inch layer that was more done from the browning process. Be
 warned, though, carry-over temp varies with the size of the
 roast. The smaller it is, the less it will carry over.

 Following these instructions for dry aging
 beef produced the best results I've ever had. Even a mundane
 supermarket rib roast tastes incredible after 3 days of dry
 aging a la Alton Brown (it works with any cut of beef.) This
 slow roasted rib roast was the best roast I've ever made - and
 I've been an avid home cook for 25 years. Alton, you're the

 I tried this recipe on
 my BBQ, using the recommended rub and following the cooking
 instructions after "dry aging" for 72 hours. It was a tight
 fit using the pot and saucer in the BBQ, but well worth it.
 Also, cooking it at a low temp, letting it stand, then finishing
 off at 500 degrees kept it moist. most awesome rib roast yet.

 I have made this at least 6 times

 terra cotta planter and base that just fits in my oven to cook
 it. It is a pain, but it makes the best roast. I have adjusted
 the cooking times a bit because we live in a high altitude area.
 This is the meal my dad asks for when it is birthday, anniversary
 and any time he can get me to make it for him. Just add sweet
 creamed corn, scallopped potatoes and asparagus and you are
 set.

 Caution with the high heat at the end of this cooking. Any "stuff

 This is a great recipe. It is easy and has
 quickly become a family favorite. The low heat cooking method
 results in a very evenly cooked roast. Wonderful if you love
 your roast beef rare. Don't be scared off by the "Terra Cotta
 pot". It makes sense if you have seen the show (remember this
 is Alton Brown). It works very well in a pyrex dish covered
 with foil. I have had somewhat inconsistant results with the
 au jus. It can be a little salty from all the salt on the roast.
 It depends how much falls into the pan during the cooking process.
 I have also "exploded" a pyrex dish on my range while deglazing.
 Ooops. Make sure you heat it evenly.

 Follow the rest of the drill...I've
 done a couple of 4-ribs and a 7-rib. Same drill for all sizes,
 shapes. It may be the best rib roast you've had in your entire
 life...it will be medium rare-ish, though, deal with it...age
 it for 4-6 days if you can. It gets funky looking, but you will
 not believe the whole dang thing when you taste it. You will
 finally understand WHY you have taste buds. The sage au jus
 is easy/excellent.

 I didn't have a clay pot, but the rib roast
 still turned out great. I also cooked a cheap pork roast in
 the same manner (low, then high) and it was even more popular
 than the roast. Go figure. Like some of the other reviews, a
 better time estimate would've been helpful, but I was real lucky
 and both roasts were perfect doneness

 This is a fantastic recipe for cooking a
 great holiday meal. It is now a tradition for our family to
 buy a good sized rib roast (we go with a six bone roast) and
 to cook this with a whole smattering of side dishes. The meat
 is always flavorful and tender. It has a slightly peppery and
 salty quality that pervades the whole roast, but not enough
 to alter the natural flavor of the meat, just to draw out it's
 inherent flavors. The roast comes out with a nice medium well
 slice on either end of the roast and succulent rare slices in
 the center, truly a phenomenal thing for famlies that have differeing
 tastes on doneness. Excellent meal, bar none.

 As a chef I am always looking for something new.
 I thought this recepie sounded great but I found the end result
 to be a little tough. I mean it was ok but nothing special.
 I followed the recepi exactly and used a cut of black angus
 choice. The meat looked great when finish, pink though-out but
 was a little chewy. I have always learned with expensive cuts
 of meat you need to use higher heat.

 I have wanted to try this
 for some time now and finally did. Couldnt find the planter
 as most stores around here dont carry that thing in winter.
 Anyway I only had time to dry age for a little over 2 days.
 You have to be trusting as the meat starts to look scary. When
 it was finally time to cook I let it stand out for about an
 hour and a half (something they always talk about but didnt
 have in the recipe). Put in the oven @ 200 and waited.... and
 waited.. and waited. I think it must cook faster with the planter
 as it took about 5 hrs to hit 118. I pulled the meat out and
 it was so cool that the temp didnt rise at all. I put the roast
 back in at 225 and set the alarm for 125. This took about another
 hour to reach, much to the dismay of my now very hungry guests.
 Once this temp was reached I pulled the roast and covered, then
 started the wine reduction. This step takes longer than I thought
 (about 45 minutes), for something that, in my opinion, tastes
 very bad. I guess I dont like the taste of Sage, but everyone
 is different. When i cut the meat though, I was very pleased
 to find it very flavorful with great texture, and this is only
 2 days dry aging, next time I will go the 3 days or more. Over
 all it was good but if you dont have the planter plan on about
 6 to 7 hrs of cook/ prep time. Also I would take to roast to
 at least 120 or more the meat was still a nice mid rare and
 didnt coast to much over 130 (134 I think).

 if you stick to his temp/moisture guidlines, you'll be fine.

 I love good juicy pink beef, but
 the temps given on the show were a bit on the rare side. If
 you will have guests that like beef on the medium or done side
 add another ten degrees to what he recommends on the show. I
 followed the recipe exactly and thought it was to absolutely
 die for but, my wife likes her beef "done" and even the outer
 cuts were not acceptable to her. It all depends on your guests
 however and this recipe absolutely kicks behind if you're a
 prime rib fan. Use the clay pot, it does make a difference with
 the crust at the end.

 Christmas Day Dinner was looking

 factors also played a big part of my hesitance. But watching
 Alton do anything gives the confidence needed to proceed any
 task. I followed his instuction perfectly, however I could not
 locate the clay cover. I continued without it, and it turned
 out to be the BEST PRIME RIB ever!!!! All of my family raved,
 we now have a new tradition. Not only did we enjoy the leftovers
 as French Dips, I made a chili using the bones and tiny bit
 left. If you are looking for the perfect recipe look no further...

 I've had horrible results with standing
 rib roasts several times in the past and was largely discouraged
 by the tough and fatty results and the total waste of money.
 On pure faith in dear Alton I tried it again this year. I purchased
 a grocery-store choice cut of meat (to minimize my losses if
 it was another bomb--faith only goes so far). My local Home
 Depot supplied the appropriate pottery, and my cooler drawer
 in my fridge did the aging. (I was nervous, afraid I'd end up
 with a rotten piece of meat.) Let me tell you, this roast rivaled
 the local 4-star restaurants. Alton, you are wonderful! And
 to the person who asked if the pottery is necessary because
 it's inconvenient: yes, it's necessary, and if you want convenience
 you can get pre-cooked rib roast slices at your local Costco!

 I didn't use the clay pot as the oven didn't need it. The wonderful

 and every slice looked better than the one previous. This was
 simply grand!
