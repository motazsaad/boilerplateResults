<p>What are the main work projects?Teaching conversational English
 to elementary, high school, and adult students is the service
 project in H&oacute;dmez&otilde;v&aacute;s&aacute;rhely, (pronounced
 HOD-mezer-vah-shar-hey or just VAH-shar-hey) in southern Hungary.
 All volunteers teach under the direction of Hungarian teachers.
 You will assist in the day's classroom work using student texts
 and established lesson plans provided by the teacher. You will
 also have opportunities to depart from the formal lessons. For
 example, you can serve as a resource on topics of North American
 culture, including discussions on history, daily lifestyle,
 sports, and school systems. American songs, games, dialogues,
 letter writing, plays, flash cards, and discussions are the
 primary techniques used depending on the ages and proficiency
 of the students.

<p>How can you be sure you are really making a difference?English
 has become the international language of commerce and technology.
 Children and adults all over the world want to learn English
 as a tool for their future development. That is why the mayor,
 teachers and school administrators in the H&oacute;dmez&otilde;v&aacute;s&aacute;rhely
 invited Global Volunteers to send volunteers to teach conversational
 English in 2003. The Hungarian English teachers are very good
 English grammarians and they are excellent teachers. However,
 English is their second, third or perhaps fourth language. Students
 want and need to learn pronunciation, idioms, and syntax from
 native English speakers. With that said, it is apparent that
 sharing English conversation with a native speaker for only
 one or two weeks will not greatly enhance a student's ability
 to speak English. However, working with several native English
 speakers for many weeks each year - year after year - can have
 a tremendous positive effect. We know this is the case because
 the teachers with whom we have worked in communities all over
 the world continue to invite us back and enthusiastic students
 keep showing up for class, month after month, year after year.
 You can truly make an enormous difference in the lives of Hungarian
 students by teaching conversational English, even for just a
 week or two!

<p>What types of people volunteer in country?This is one of Global
 Volunteers newest programs; however, based upon our experience
 in other Eastern European countries, people from all walks of
 life and throughout the U.S. will volunteer in Hungary. A majority
 will be women, most will be college graduates, and about half
 will be retirees.

<p>How many volunteers are on each team?Most Global Volunteers teams
 include between 8 and 15 volunteers plus the team leader.

<p>If you don't find an answer to your question,please call 800-487-1074.

<p>Which airport should I book my flight into?Please schedule your
 arrival for Ferihegy Airport in Budapest, Hungary

<p>When should I arrive in Budapest?

<p>Please arrive at Ferihegy Airport In Budapest no later than 3:30
 PM on the first day of the service program. If you plan your
 arrival for after 3:30 PM, you will be responsible for your
 own transportation to the Hotel F&aacute;ma in H&oacute;dmez&otilde;v&aacute;s&aacute;rhely,
 our host community. Bear in mind, however, that H&oacute;dmez&otilde;v&aacute;s&aacute;rhely
 is a three-hour drive from Budapest and that the only way to
 get there on your own might be by a combination of train and
 bus, which would involve at least two transfers. Should you
 be unable to purchase a ticket for the first day of the service
 program, please make arrangements to arrive prior to, not after,
 that date. Global Volunteers requires that all volunteers arrive
 by the scheduled start date of the service program.

<p>Will someone meet me at the airport?Provided you send your flight
 itinerary to Global Volunteers at least two weeks in advance
 of the service program start date and arrive during the designated
 arrival window, your team leader will be at Ferihegy Airport
 to meet you and your fellow team members from 12:00 PM to 3:30
 PM. If you arrive before 12:00 PM, you can wait for your team
 leader in the arrivals area of Terminal 2B. 

<p>What should I do if my flight is delayed?If your flight is delayed
 or you miss a connection, please notify Global Volunteers at
 612-850-4750 as soon as possible of your new arrival plans so
 that we can inform your team leader. You can call either 800-487-1074
 or 651-407-6100 during normal business hours (8 AM to 5 PM Monday
 through Friday, US central time), or call 612-850-4750 evenings,
 weekends and holidays. You can leave a voice mail message on
 any of these numbers if no one answers. However, if it is a
 weekend or U.S. holiday you must leave the message on 612-850-4750.
 If you must leave a message, it is important that you also contact
 the hotel where you are scheduled to stay and leave a message
 for the Global Volunteers' team leader.

<p>How can I get from the airport to the hotel on my own?Volunteers
 will be lodged at the Hotel F&aacute;ma in our host community
 of H&oacute;dmez&otilde;v&aacute;s&aacute;rhely, which is about
 a three-hour drive from Budapest to the southeast. Getting to
 H&oacute;dmez&otilde;v&aacute;s&aacute;rhely on your own would
 likely prove challenging, but were you to do so, one option
 would be the take a taxi from Ferihegy Airport to Nyugati Train
 Station in central Budapest. Then take a train from Nyugati
 Station to the southern Hungarian city of Szeged. From the Szeged
 train station, you could either take a second train to H&oacute;dmez&otilde;v&aacute;s&aacute;rhely
 or catch a bus (buses are yellow and are run by a company called
 H&oacute;dmez&otilde;), which would take you to a number of
 stops in downtown H&oacute;dmez&otilde;v&aacute;s&aacute;rhely
 (H&oacute;dmez&otilde;v&aacute;s&aacute;rhely is about 30 minutes
 from Szeged). It might also be possible to forego all of the
 above and hire a private car to take you the entire way from
 Ferihegy Airport to H&oacute;dmez&otilde;v&aacute;s&aacute;rhely,
 but such a service would be very expensive.

<p>If I am delayed, how late can I arrive at the Hotel Fama in H&oacute;dmez&otilde;v&aacute;s&aacute;rhely?
 

<p>Our orientation sessions are a critical component of the preparation
 for your teaching assignments. If circumstances beyond your
 control prevent you from reaching the program on the opening
 Saturday of the program (the program's first day), then we require
 that you arrive no later than 9:00 AM on the first Sunday.

<p>What should I do if I arrive prior to the scheduled arrival date?If
 you plan your arrival in Hungary before the designated program
 start date and choose not to meet the team leader at the airport,
 you will be responsible for your own transportation to the hotel.
 

<p>Will Global Volunteers make a reservation for me at the hotel
 if I arrive early?If you are arriving early and choose to stay
 at the Hotel F&aacute;ma, please contact the hotel to make reservations
 for your early arrival days. If you want to stay somewhere else,
 we recommend that you check the numerous guidebooks available
 on Hungary to find a hotel that fits your needs.

<p>If I plan to arrive where can I stay?Global Volunteers teams
 serving in H&oacute;dmez&otilde;v&aacute;s&aacute;rhely stay
 at the Hotel F&aacute;ma for the duration of the program. The
 hotel staff will be happy to reserve a room for you if you arrive
 prior to, or after the program dates. 

<p>When making your reservation, identify yourself as a member of
 a Global Volunteers team. The cost of a single room costs between
 US$30 to US$45, and the cost of a double room usually runs from
 US$40 to US$55.

<p>At what time and on what date can I depart Hungary?

<p>Please plan your departure for 12:00 PM or later on the final
 day of the service program. Your team leader will accompany
 you to the airport to assist you with check-in. If you plan
 your departure for earlier than 12:00 PM on the last day, you
 will be responsible for your own transportation back to Budapest
 (a three-hour trip by private car). Similarly, if you choose
 to depart by rail or other means, you will be responsible for
 your own transportation.

<p>If you don't find an answer to your question, please call 800-487-1074.

<p>What are the sleeping accommodations?Volunteers stay at the Hotel
 F&aacute;ma, a charming tourist-class Hungarian hotel. The rooms
 are double occupancy, although single rooms are available for
 an additional fee. The Hotel F&aacute;ma is centrally located
 and within walking distance of a pharmacy, bank, grocery store,
 internet cafe, and most of the schools where we teach.

<p>Are single rooms available?

<p>Single rooms are available for an additional fee. To secure a
 single room, you must pay Global Volunteers the single supplement
 charge no later than 30 days prior to the start of the service
 program. Singles are sometimes limited and thus are available
 on a first come basis. When available, the cost of a single
 supplement is USD $315 for one week, USD $420 for two weeks
 and USD $630 for three weeks.

<p>(Hotel prices are subject to change. Please confirm with a volunteer
 coordinator that these prices are still available) 

<p>What are the bathroom facilities?Each room has a private bathroom
 with shower.

 double-pronged version used throughout Europe) for your electrical
 appliances unless they are dual voltage.

<p>If I am arriving early, where do I stay?If you arrive in Hungary
 prior to the start date of the service program, you may choose
 to stay at Hotel Fama. 

<p>What is the local cuisine?The food is absolutely delightful.
 Hungarians are well known for their delicious soups and Hungarian
 goulash. In addition, their fish, meats (particularly beef and
 veal), vegetables, and deserts are also wonderful. A typical
 main meal will have bread, a salad, soup, an entr&eacute;e,
 and then dessert or fruit.

<p>Where do we eat?Breakfast is eaten at the hotel, lunch is either
 at the school or restaurant, and dinner is at a restaurant.

<p>Can special diets be accommodated?Avoiding meat is not a major
 problem. However, strict vegetarians or vegans may be difficult
 to accommodate. Volunteers with such strict requirements will
 eat mostly bread, and vegetables. Consider bringing familiar
 foods to supplement your diet if you have especially restrictive
 special needs.

<p>Will potable drinking water be provided? We do not recommend
 drinking the tap water. Bottled water is readily available.

<p>What health precautions should I take?We strongly recommend that
 you visit with your personal physician, public health care provider
 or international travel clinic to determine what immunizations,
 vaccinations and other precautions you should take to prepare
 for your trip. In addition to your local resources, there are
 a number of other sources available that offer current information
 on required or recommended immunizations and precautions:

<p>Does Global Volunteers provide medical evacuation insurance?Yes,
 you will be covered by emergency medical evacuation insurance
 on the days of the service program through AIG ASSIST up to
 a maximum of $50,000 USD. If you want to be covered either before
 or after the service program, contact AIG ASSIST. This insurance
 only covers the costs of evacuation. You'll need other insurance
 to cover the costs of medical services.

<p>Does Global Volunteers provide or recommend travel insurance?We
 strongly recommend that you be covered while traveling by a
 medical insurance policy. We also recommend that you purchase
 "Trip cancellation insurance." Travel agents have information
 on travel insurance providers.

<p>What is the weather like?The temperatures in southern Hungary
 range from very warm in the summer months to cold and blustery
 in the winter. Weather in the early spring and the late fall
 can be quite variable. For example, in March and November it
 is not unknown to have some days approach 65 degrees while other
 days the temperature hovers around freezing. If you are traveling
 between February and early April or between late October and
 early December, we recommend that you bring clothes for all
 weather conditions.

 June through September are the warmest months.

<p>Where do I exchange money?You can exchange money at the airport
 upon your arrival in Budapest or at local banks in H&oacute;dmez&otilde;v&aacute;s&aacute;rhely.

<p>Can I use cash, credit cards or checks?

<p>Credit Cards.

<p>A debit card can be used to get cash 24 hours a day. There are
 several outside ATM machines in H&oacute;dmez&otilde;v&aacute;s&aacute;rhely.
 Credit cards are not accepted at some stores in H&oacute;dmez&otilde;v&aacute;s&aacute;rhely.

<p>Traveler's Checks:

<p>While traveler's checks are still a safe method of safeguarding
 cash when traveling, they are not the most convenient. The banks
 in this area of Hungary are not as accustomed to American tourists.
 As a result, the process for changing traveler's checks can
 take some time.

<p>Cash:

<p>If you are bringing cash, please note that torn, worn, or defaced
 bills may not be accepted. Torn traveler's checks might also
 not be accepted.

<p>How much money should I bring with me?How much you bring depends
 on your personal spending and shopping habits and whether or
 not you want to go on an excursion during free time on the weekend.
 Weekend trips can cost between $200 - $300, depending on where
 you go, and the transportation and accommodations used. Your
 souvenir budget is discretionary. Most shops are open for business
 during the morning hours and then are closed in the afternoon
 from 1:00 PM - 3:00 or 5:00 PM. Stores then re-open in the evening
 around 7:00 PM. 

<p>If you don't find an answer to your question,please call 800-487-1074.

<p>How can my family contact me while I am in Hungary?In the event
 of an emergency, your family should refer to the contact sheet
 that you will receive prior to your departure for Hungary. This
 will include phone numbers for the hotel where you will be staying,
 our hosts in H&oacute;dmez&otilde;v&aacute;s&aacute;rhely, and
 Global Volunteers business and after hours phones. Be sure to
 leave a copy with them.

<p>What about international phone calls?There will be phones and
 faxes locally available for you to use for international communication.
 However, using locally purchased phone cards is usually cheaper
 than calling directly through the hotel.

 responsible for any charges for calls made from your room.

<p>Is internet service available?There are Internet cafes in H&oacute;dmez&otilde;v&aacute;s&aacute;rhely
