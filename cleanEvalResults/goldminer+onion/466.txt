<p>Grannyâ€™s Garden School uses the school grounds to help kids discover
 the nature in their own back yards, experience the satisfaction
 of growing and preparing their own food and the simple pleasure
 of picking a flower.

<p>We commend the Loveland school board, superintendent and principals
 for creating an environment where an organization such as ours
 could evolve. Their willingness to expand educational opportunities
 outside of the four walls of the traditional classroom make
 it possible to offer a unique learning opportunity to our students.
