<h>MPs quizzed on Metrolink snub

<p>ON HOLIDAY: Ian McCartney

<p>Tony Lloyd, Labour, Manchester Central: "I hope the transport
 secretary understands Greater Manchester expects him to return
 with proposals, and to ensure our conurbation has the Metrolink
 it badly needs."

<p>Spokeswoman for Ian McCartney, Labour, Makerfield (Labour Party
 chairman): "We cannot contact him as he is on holiday."

<p>Ian Stewart, Labour, Eccles:"I will support the M.E.N. campaign.
 I and other MPs from Greater Manchester have been working very
 hard on the development of Metrolink."

<p>Graham Stringer, Labour, Blackley: "I won't accept this decision.
 It is fundamental to the future economic health of Manchester
 that we have the extension to the tram system."

<p>Andrew Stunell, Liberal Democrat, Hazel Grove: "If the government
 is serious about reducing congestion and improving public transport,
 they must rethink this appalling decision."

<p>David Crausby, Labour, Bolton North East MP: "I am always concerned
 about money being spent in London when the north west is in
 dire need. I am disappointed that the Metrolink will not be
 extended as I would like to see it in Bolton."

<p>Brian Iddon, Labour, Bolton South East: "Bolton would not be
 directly affected by the expansion but I am disappointed. Passengers
 and Manchester Airport will suffer as the airport links were
 essential."

<p>DISAPPOINTED: Ann Coffey

<p>Spokeswoman for David Chaytor, Labour, Bury North: "He is on
 holiday and we cannot get hold of him."

<p>Spokeswoman for Hazel Blears, Labour, Salford (Home Office minister).
 The M.E.N. called both her constituency office and the Home
 Office after parliament's recess: "We cannot comment because
 she is on holiday but she will comment next week."

<p>Spokesperson for Andrew Burnham, Labour, Leigh: "He has only
 just gone on holiday."

<p>Spokesman for Gerald Kaufman, Labour, Gorton. The M.E.N. had
 tried to contact him for comment last week before Parliament's
 summer recess: "He cannot be contacted because he is in Canada."

<p>James Purnell, Labour, Stalybridge and Hyde: "A lot of money
 has been spent already. I am disappointed but the door is not
 closed yet. Hopefully we will see some progress by autumn."

<p>Ruth Kelly, Labour, MP Bolton West (treasury minister): "I have
 written to Mr Darling outlining the implications of this decision.
 I am working with my parliamentary colleagues in Greater Manchester
 to highlight the benefits."

<p>Ann Coffey, Labour, Stockport (PPS to Alistair Darling): "It
 is disappointing. It is in all our interests to control costs.
 The losers from a failure to do so are the taxpayer and public
 services. I will continue to give Metrolink wholehearted support."

<p>SUPPORTER: Graham Brady

<p>Patsy Calton, Liberal Democrat, Cheadle: "We have got to get
 it back on track. We can't allow it to disappear. It seems everybody
 I speak to in Stockport catches the train into Manchester so
 they can get on the tram."

<p>Graham Brady, Conservative, Altrincham and Sale West: "I am a
 great supporter of Metrolink. The Conservatives have both backed
 Metrolink and delivered when we were in control. The extension
 would clearly be advantageous to Greater Manchester." 

<p>Terry Lewis, Labour, Worsley: "This is an enormous setback for
 the north west region. It was announced on the same day as the
 Â£10bn Crossrail project in London - it's typical of the way
 the north west is ruled by the London elite."

<p>Phil Woolas, MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth and deputy leader
 of the House of Commons: "We are not giving up on this, far
 from it."

<p>Michael Meacher, Labour, Oldham West and Royton: "I think this
 a serious drawback and I am determined to get it re-instituted
 as quickly as possible. I do understand the concerns about cost."

<p>Paul Goggins, Labour, Wythenshawe and Sale East (prisons minister):
 "As a minister I am unable to sign up formally to a campaign
 that seeks to change government policy. But I will do everything
 I can to keep this project firmly on the government's agenda."

<p>Lorna Fitzsimons, Labour, Rochdale: "My reaction is one of huge
 disappointment. We see the Metrolink expansion as hugely important
 to Rochdale and Oldham, both in terms of their economy and regeneration."

<p>ESSENTIAL: Bev Hughes

<p>Jim Dobbin, MP for Heywood and Middleton: "I very much support
 the campaign. The more opinion formers we have the better and
 that includes the Manchester Evening News."

<p>Keith Bradley, Labour, Manchester Withington: "There will be
 huge disappointment in South Manchester because of yet another
 delay in bringing Metrolink extensions through to my constituency
 and to Manchester Airport."

<p>Beverley Hughes, Labour MP for Stretford and Urmston: "The extension
 is essential and should go ahead. Metrolink is a really crucial
 part of Greater Manchester's economic development."

<p>Andrew Bennett, Labour, Denton and Reddish: "I am utterly disgusted.
 It's another example of the way people of London and the south
 east get resources. We need to look at new ways of funding this
 project including congestion charging."

<p>David Heyes, Labour, Ashton-under-Lyne: "It's a double blow for
 me and my constituents as two lines would have run through Ashton.
 I am seeking an urgent meeting with Mr Darling. I will carry
 on fighting."

<p>Ivan Lewis, Labour, Bury South, Minister for Skills and Vocational
 Education: I endorse other MPs and I going back to the Department
 of Transport and getting them to think again . . . we all need
 to work together."
