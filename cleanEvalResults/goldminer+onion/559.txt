<h>A Christian Declaration on Marriage

<p>As we celebrate the 2000th

<p> anniversary of the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ, entering
 the third millennium, we pledge together to honor the Lord by
 committing ourselves afresh to God&#146;s first institution
 &#151; marriage.

<p>We believe that marriage is a holy union of one man and one woman
 in which they commit, with God&#146;s help, to build a loving,
 life-giving, faithful relationship that will last for a lifetime.
 God has established the married state, in the order of creation
 and redemption, for spouses to grow in love of one another and
 for the procreation, nurture, formation and education of children.

<p>We believe that in marriage many principles of the Kingdom of
 God are manifested. The interdependence of healthy Christian
 community is clearly exemplified in loving one another (John
 13:34), forgiving one another (Ephesians 4:32), confessing to
 one another (James 5:16), and submitting to one another (Ephesians
 5:21). These principles find unique fulfillment in marriage.
 Marriage is God&#146;s gift, a living image of the union between
 Christ and His Church.

<p>We believe that when a marriage is true to God&#146;s loving
 design it brings spiritual, physical, emotional, economic, and
 social benefits not only to a couple and family but also to
 the Church and to the wider culture. Couples, churches, and
 the whole of society have a stake in the well-being of marriages.
 Each, therefore, has its own obligations to prepare, strengthen,
 support and restore marriages. 

<p>Our nation is threatened by a high divorce rate, a rise in cohabitation,
 a rise in non-marital births, a decline in the marriage rate,
 and a diminishing interest in and readiness for marrying, especially
 among young people. The documented adverse impact of these trends
 on children, adults, and society is alarming. Therefore, as
 church leaders, we recognize an unprecedented need and responsibility
 to help couples begin, build, and sustain better marriages,
 and to restore those threatened by divorce.

<p>Motivated by our common desire that God&#146;s Kingdom be manifested
 on earth as it is in heaven, we pledge to deepen our commitment
 to marriage. With three-quarters of marriages performed by clergy,
 churches are uniquely positioned not only to call America to
 a stronger commitment to this holy union but to provide practical
 ministries and influence for reversing the course of our culture.
 It is evident in cities across the nation that where churches
 join in common commitment to restore a priority on marriage,
 divorces are reduced and communities are positively influenced.

<p> Therefore, we call on churches throughout America to do their
 part to strengthen marriage in our nation by providing:

<l>Prayer and spiritual support for stronger marriages

<l>Encouragement for people to marry

<l>Education for young people about the meaning and responsibility
 of marriage

<l>Preparation for those engaged to be married

<l>Pastoral care, including qualified mentor couples, for couples
 at all stages of their relationship

<l>Help for couples experiencing marital difficulty and disruption

<l>Influence within society and the culture to uphold the institution
 of marriage.

<p>Further, we urge churches in every community to join in developing
 policies and programs with concrete goals to reduce the divorce
 rate and increase the marriage rate.

<p>By our commitment to marriage as instituted by God, the nature
 of His Kingdom will be more clearly revealed in our homes, our
 churches, and our culture. To that end we pray and labor with
 the guidance of the Holy Spirit.

<p>May the grace of God, the presence of Christ, and the empowerment
 of the Holy Spirit be abundant in all those who so commit and
 be a blessing to all whose marriages we seek to strengthen.

<h>Background on the Christian Declaration on Marriageby Michael
 J. McManus

<p> The National Association of Evangelicals, the National Council
 of Churches of Christ and America's two largest denominations,
 the Roman Catholic Church and the Southern Baptist Convention
 &#151; had never cooperated on anything prior to signing "A
 Christian Declaration on Marriage." They were moved to do so
 by the documented disintegration of marriage in America and
 the evidence seen in dozens of American cities "where churches
 join in common commitment to restore a priority on marriage,
 divorces are reduced and communities are positively influenced,"
 as they put it. This memo provides data on the scale of the
 problem as well as an overview of the progress that has been
 made locally when churches "provide practical ministries and
 influence for reversing the course of our culture." 

<h>Marriage In America Is Disintegrating

<h>There has been an alarming disintegration of marriage in America:
 

<l>Divorces tripled from 1960 and 1979, rising from 390,000 to 1,181,000.
 By 1997 they declined only 1.5% to 1,163,000. More marriages
 now end in divorce than death.

<l>The marriage rate fell 35% between 1970 and 1998. Only 56% of
 U.S. adults are married today, down from 73%. There are only
 2.38 million marriages a year.

<l>Cohabitation skyrocketed 10-fold, from 430,000 in 1960 to 4.26
 million living together in 1998. Cohabitation, not marriage,
 is the dominant way male-female unions are formed.

<l>Cohabitation is a double cancer of marriage.
 a. For millions,
 cohabitation is a substitute for marriage. A quarter of unmarried
 women aged 25-39 are currently living with a partner, and an
 additional quarter have done so in the past. According to the
 University of Wisconsin, of 100 couples who begin living together
 40 break up before a wedding. One result: the number of never-married
 couples has doubled from 21 million in 1970 to 46.5 million
 in 1998, diverting 25 million from getting married at all. 

 b. The second cancer is that cohabitation increases a couple's
 odds of divorce by 50%. What many call a "trial marriage" should
 be more accurately termed a "trial divorce." The only question
 is whether they break up before the wedding or afterward. So
 of the 100 cohabiting couples, 60 will marry, but 45 will divorce.
 That leaves only 15 couples still together after a decade! 

<l>Children of divorce are the greatest victims of divorce. They
 are twice as likely as children from an intact family to drop
 out of school, three times more likely to have a child out of
 wedlock, six times more likely to be in poverty or to commit
 suicide, and 12 times more likely to be incarcerated. Furthermore,
 as Judith Wallerstein's powerful new book, The Unexpected Legacy
 of Divorce, documents the impact of divorce on kids "grows at
 least into the third decade." Based on interviews of 100 children
 of divorce over 25 years, she reports that "From the viewpoint
 of the children, and counter to what happens to their parents,
 divorce is a cumulative experience. Its impact increases over
 time and rises to a crescendo in adulthood. In adulthood it
 affects personality, the ability to trust, expectations about
 relationships and ability to cope with change... Anxiety leads
 many into making bad choices in relationships, giving up hastily
 when problems arise, or avoiding relationships altogether."

<h>Good News: Marriage is the Key to Happiness, Long Life, Wealth!

<p>As Linda Waite and Maggie Gallagher point out in their important
 new book, The Case ForMarriage, married people are healthier,
 happier, wealthier, live longer and have better sex than those
 who divorce or remain single. Oddly, this is news to our culture.
 Thus, secular evidence backs up Scripture. "The Lord God said,
 `It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper
 suitable for him'" (Genesis 2:18).Selected data in brief:

<l>Happiness:Married people are twice as likely as those who are
 single for whatever reason to say they are "very happy." Some
 40% of married couples say they are very happy, compared to
 15% of the separated, 18% of the divorced. What's surprising
 is that only 22% of the never-married and cohabitors are very
 happy, the same as widows.

<l>Longevity:A married man of 48 has an 88% chance of living until
 age 65, but a divorced man has only a 65% odds of survival!A
 married woman aged 48 has an 92% chance of living to age 65;
 but a divorced woman's odds are only 82%. Divorced men are twice
 as likely to suffer from heart attacks, cancer and four times
 as likely to be in automobile accidents or to commit suicide,
 reports J.J. Lynch in The Broken Heart. 

<l>Wealth: A married couple in their 50's in 1994 had net assets
 of $132,000 or $66,000 per person. However, a divorced person's
 assets are just $33,600. Surprisingly, a never-married individual
 has a net worth of only $35,000; the separated, a pitiful $7,600.
 

<l>Sex: "Married sex really is better sex," report Waite and Gallagher.
 "Married women are almost twice as likely as divorced or never-married
 women to have a sex life that (a) exists and (b) is extremely
 emotionally satisfying." Some 43 percent of married men had
 sex at least twice a week vs. only 26 percent of single men.
 

<h>Churches Have Proven Answers

<p>Some churches have developed reforms that are preparing couples
 for a lifelong marriage, strengthening existing marriages or
 saving troubled ones. Catholics created strong premarital programs,
 but many post-marital pioneering ministries have come from Protestants:

<l>Time: For a generation, most Catholic dioceses have required
 a minimum time of marriage preparation &#151; typically six
 months from the time a priest first meets with the couple, 'til
 the wedding. During that time, many couples are asked to take
 a premarital inventory to give them an objective view of strengths
 and weaknesses and attend classes on such issues as communication
 and finances. The results of better marriage preparation is
 clear in a recent George Barna survey showing Catholics have
 America's lowest divorce rate.

<l>Premarital Inventory: There are two widely used premarital inventories,
 FOCCUS and PREPARE, each taken by about 200,000 couples a year.
 Either can predict with 80% accuracy which couples will divorce.
 More important, a tenth of those who take either inventory,
 break their engagements. Studies show their scores are equal
 to those who marry and later divorce! Consequently, those couples
 who break an engagement avoid a bad marriage before it begins.

<l>Mentor Couples in Marriage Preparation: Mike &amp; Harriet McManus
 trained 52 Mentor Couples in their home church to administer
 a premarital inventory with seriously dating and engaged couples.
 From 1992-2000 Mentors worked with 308 couples. About 50 broke
 off their relationship/engagement -- 16.5% of the total. Thus,
 those in weak relationships discovered it on their own and either
 broke up or strengthened their union. Mentors also taught couples
 how to improve communication and conflict resolution. Of the
 250+ who did marry, there are only six known divorces in eight
 years, a failure rate of 2.4%. 

<l>Marriage Encounter has been attended by 1.6 million Catholic
 couples and 600,000 Protestants. After Lead Couples share intimate
 details of their marriage, attending couples write to each other
 on assigned topics and discuss them privately. The process encourages
 participating couples to communicate more deeply. Sixty studies
 show that 80% to 90% of attendees fall back in love, and permanently
 improve the quality of their marriage. Family Life Weekends
 led by evangelicals are another weekend retreat to strengthen
 marriages.

<l>Retrouvaille is a similar weekend retreat developed by Catholics.
 However the Lead Couples are those whose marriages once nearly
 failed. These "back-from-the-brink" couples share details about
 how they overcame years of adultery, alcoholism, physical abuse,
 etc., to build solid marriages. The results are stunning. Of
 60,000 couples who attended, fourout of five couples have rebuilt
 their marriages. However, in most cities Retrouvaille is held
 only 2-3 times a year.

<l>Marriage Ministry is a similar proven way to save couples headed
 for divorce, but it is based in local churches. Rev. Dick &amp;
 Phyllis McGinnis, formerly of St. David's Episcopal Church in
 Jacksonville, Florida trained seven couples whose marriages
 nearly failed to help those now in trouble. One woman had been
 in an adulterous affair for eight years. A man was a bisexual
 who had homosexual affairs. Another was an alcoholic who lost
 his job and was out of work for two years. Yet they identified
 17 steps all experienced to save their marriages. They shared
 their path of recovery with 40 troubled marriages, and saved
 38 of them -- a 95% success rate. Marriage Ministry has spread
 to 25 churches. In seven of them, 40 Mentor Couples have worked
 with 213 troubled marriages, and saved 193 of them. That's a
 success rate of 90% in the transplants. 

<l>Stepfamily Support Groups: Some 46% of all marriages today involve
 at least one spouse who was previously married. Families with
 stepchildren are the most explosive in America -- breaking up
 at a 65% rate. Stepchildren resent their new "parent" and often
 drive them away. Rev. Dick Dunn of Roswell United Methodist
 Church near Atlanta created a "Stepfamily Support Group" led
 by couples with truly blended families. Result: four out of
 five couples make it, the mirror opposite of usual failure.
 These groups have been planted in other churches.

<p>The core idea of the best programs, summarized in one sentence:
 

<p>In every church there are couples with good marriageswho really
 couldbe of help to other couples, but have never been asked,
 inspired or trained to come alongside another couple and share
 their wisdom on how to make a marriage successful.

<h>Mentoring Is a Biblical Concept

<p>The mentoring model is based on age-old Biblical principles.
 In his letter to Titus, Paul urged the older women to "train
 the younger women to love their husbands and children." Similarly,
 the older men are to set "an example" to the younger men. (Titus
 2:3-6). A Marriage Savers Church demonstrates, in the area of
 marriage, that the pastor's task, as St. Paul instructed the
 Ephesians (4:12) is to "equip the saints for ministry" or to
 "train God&#146;s people for service." What more important ministry
 or service is there than saving marriages? Who is better equipped
 to lead this ministry or service than married couples in long-term,
 happy marriages?" Luke 10:1 says Jesus sent his disciples out
 "two by two." Could this not be husband and wife, husband and
 wife serving as Mentor Couples, bringing hope to the marital
 darkness?

<h>"Marriage Saver Churches"

<p>One of the most exciting developments in recent years is to witness
 the emergence of "Marriage Savers Churches" in all parts of
 America. Churches of very diverse denominations -- Mainline,
 Evangelical, Pentecostal and African-American churches -- have
 virtually eliminated divorce! Christ Lutheran Church in Overland
 Park, KS, for example, a congregation of 1,500 people, has had
 only two divorces in three years, couples who did not seek help.
 First Assembly of God of Rockford, IL invited the McGinnises
 to train 14 "back-from-the-brink" couples in their church to
 work with troubled marriages. Local therapists learned about
 Marriage Ministry and sent dozens of their toughest cases to
 First Assembly. In three years, the Mentors, whom they call
 "Marriage Savers," have met with more than 100 marriages headed
 toward divorce, and saved all but four of them. By contrast,
 even Christian therapists save only 20% of the troubled marriages.
 Bread of Life, an inner city church in Kansas City, KS has had
 no divorces since training Mentors. The same is true of Killearn
 United Methodist Church, a congregation of 2,500 in Tallahassee.
 Pearce Memorial Church in North Chili, NY has had only one separation
 in two years. An American Baptist congregation, First Baptist
 of Sioux Falls, SD trained 40 couples for marriage, losing none
 to divorce, and worked with 10 troubled marriages, losing only
 one. To learn more, see "Churches" 

<p>I wrote a new ManualTo Create a Marriage Savers Congregation
 with details on how to jump-start all of these reforms.The 183-page
 Manual has different Sections on how Mentor Couples can help
 at all stages of the marital life cycle: preparation, enrichment,
 reconstruction of troubled marriages, reconciliation of the
 separated and Stepfamilies. There are manageable, concrete steps
 to make it easy for any church to launch these ministries. Marriage
 Savers offers a two-day training of clergy and Mentor Couples
 to immerse them in how to launch Marriage Saver Churches. It
 is held nationally twice a year taught by the pioneers of the
 ministries outlined above. This training is also provided to
 couples and pastors in cities that adopt a "Community Marriage
 Policy" where clergy pledge to start all of these marital reforms.
 

<h>The Community Marriage Policy®

<p>In 1986, at my suggestion, the clergy of Modesto, CA, 95 Protestant
 and Catholic pastors, signed the first Community Marriage Policy®
 with the goal "to radically reduce the divorce rate of those
 married in area churches." Fifteen years later, that dream is
 a reality. The divorce rate has fallen 47.6%, saving about 1,300
 marriages a year that would have ended in divorce in a county
 of 400,000 people. (See my column on p. 3 for details.) Marriage
 Savers, has helped create 136 Community Marriage Policies® or
 Community Marriage Covenants® as some clergy call them, as of
 February, 2001. They are in 38 states and range in size from
 20 pastors in Culpeper, Virginia to 300 clergy who signed in
 Minneapolis-St. Paul. Most include a commitment by Catholic,
 Mainline, Evangelical and minority pastors to:

<l>Normally require a minimum of four months marriage preparation

<l>Require the taking of a premarital inventory, a minimum of four
 to eight sessions, meeting with a Mentor Couple to review the
 inventory and to learn communication skills.

<l>Train mature married couples to serve as Mentor Couples to those
 preparing for marriage, newlyweds or those experiencing marital
 difficulties

<l>Mentor Couples meet with newlyweds during their first year of
 marriage

<l>Strengthen existing marriages by organizing an annual enrichment
 event such as Marriage Encounter, Family Life or "Ten Great
 Dates"

<l>Restore troubled marriages by creating a Marriage Ministry led
 by "back-from-the-brink" couples who share how they have weathered
 life's storms

<l>Help the separated to reconcile with a course, "Reconciling God's
 Way" 

<l>Establish Stepfamily Support Groups to help marriages with stepchildren
 to be successful 

<h>Divorces Plunge in 31 Cities with Community Marriage Policies

<p>Divorces have plunged in 31 of 33 cities where the impact of
 Community Marriage Policy® has been measured with data on divorces
 from county courts. Nationally, U.S. divorces have fallen from
 1,181,000 in 1979 to 1,163,000 in 1997, a decline of only 1.5%
 in 19 years. By contrast, Modesto's divorce rate plunged a remarkable
 47.5% in 15 years. The divorce rate is falling even faster in
 newer CMP cities. In only three years, divorces plummeted by
 18% in Corvallis, OR and Fremont, NE, by 19% in Chattanooga,
 and by nearly one-third in El Paso (from 3,176 to 2,179) and
 in Kansas City, KS and two suburban counties (from 1,530 in
 1995 to only 1,034 in 1998), while divorces actually rose across
 the river in Kansas City, MO and its suburbs! Thus, divorces
 in both Kansas City and El Paso have fallen 22 times more than
 in the U.S. in about one-sixth of the time (3 years vs. 19 years),
 or more than 100 times faster than in the U.S. 

<h>A National Strategy to Save Marriages

<p>Ours is a nation of 300,000 churches. If only a third trained
 10 Mentor Couples each, there would be one million Mentor Couples!
 Surely, they could save half of the marriages ending in divorce.
 Can we make that dream a reality? 

<p>Those who created the Christian Declaration on Marriage represent
 241,177 churches:

<p>Organization

<p>Churches

<p>People

<p>On the night before he died, Jesus prayed that his followers
 "may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you."
 Sadly, the Christian church is splintered into scores of denominations
 and thousands of independent churches who never seem to be one.
 However, in community after community, marriage is an issue
 that is bonding the shattered Christian church. Clergy of all
 faiths have come together in 136 cities to create Community
 Marriage Policies that are driving divorce rates down. Each
 Covenant is what Jesus called a "city on a hill," sending out
 beams of hope into the marital darkness. Every church in America
 has couples who could help other couples at key stages of marriage,
 building a "safety net" under every marriage. God will bless
 our effort to work together to strengthen His first institution.
 Jesus called himself the bridegroom of the church. 

<p> What God has joined together, the church should hold together.
 This is a new vision for the 21st Century Church &#151; a noble
 reaffirmation of our common commitment to Jesus Christ on the
 2000th
