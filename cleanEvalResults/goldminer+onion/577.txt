<p>Organisations across Australia are increasingly moving towards
 external service providers for the provision of IT services.
 As a result, contract management is becoming one of the core
 activities of overall IT management. With 97% of Australian
 organisations outsourcing at least some aspect of their IT services
 and nearly 30% of the IT budget on average, contract planning
 and management has become one of the core competencies of any
 IT responsibility.

 The changing nature of contracting means that the managing
 responsibility transcends the traditional, more administrative
 role. To manage todayâ€™s contracts, a direct role must be played
 at a strategic and operational level to ensure value for money
 is achieved and risks are minimised.
