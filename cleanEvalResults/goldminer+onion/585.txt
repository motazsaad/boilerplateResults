<h>Staring

<p>WHEN TO SEE YOUR DOCTOR

<p> * Someone informs you that you've had a brief staring spell
 during which you were unresponsive and you have no memory of
 the episode. 

<p>What Your Symptom Is Telling You

<p>It's normal to stare if a Grace Kelly look-alike sits across
 from you on the bus. Or to have a vacant, out-to-lunch look
 when daydreaming about winning the lottery. But what if you've
 just been told that you've had a brief, fixed, blank stare on
 your face, you didn't respond to your name and worse, you remember
 zilch about this staring spell? 

<p> You could have had a mild type of epileptic seizure, according
 to Allan Krumholz, M.D., professor of neurology at the University
 of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore. This type of seizure
 was formerly called petit mal but is now called absence, because
 people look absentminded, he says. 

<p> When a person has an absence seizure, says Dr. Krumholz, they've
 momentarily lost consciousness because their brain has been
 taken over by abnormal electrical activity. 

<p>Symptom Relief

<p>If this is your first staring episode, it's important to see
 a doctor to identify the cause and start treatment, says Dr.
 Krumholz. (For more information about the kinds of things your
 doctor will consider, see Seizures on page 448.)
