<p>MARGARET WARNER: Amb. Negroponte, welcome, and thanks for being
 with us. 

<p>
 We have heard roughly that there was a 60 percent turnout.
 What is the latest you can tell us or what more do you know
 about the ethnic breakdown of the turnout, ethnic and religious?

<p>AMB. JOHN NEGROPONTE: I think it's very difficult to say at this
 time. The Independent Iraqi Electoral Commission has even pulled
 back a bit from giving out any estimates, and I think we're
 going to have to wait for the next day or two before we get
 some reliable turnout figures.

<p> But clearly there's going to be important representation from
 the Kurdish areas, from the Shiia groups, from the non-sectarian
 parties based here in Baghdad, and probably slightly lesser
 representation in terms of the proportions on the part of the
 Sunni people living in the so-called Sunni Triangle area.

<p>Constructing a future

<p>MARGARET WARNER: And give us your sense of how soon, just in
 practical terms, we'll actually see this transitional national
 assembly sit down to meet?

<p>AMB. JOHN NEGROPONTE: Well, of course, this is the first time
 that all this is happening, so none of us have much of an experience
 base to refer back to, but the results are supposed to be known
 in the next seven or ten days; I think then there's allowance
 for perhaps challenges and so forth, so let's assume a couple
 of weeks until the results are finally certified. 

<p>And then it will take some time for the new assembly to organize
 itself and its first act will be to pick a new presidency, which
 it will have to select by a two-thirds vote, so that could take
 several weeks time.

<p>MARGARET WARNER: Now of course an overriding issue is how to
 get the Sunnis to participate in this political process that's
 about to unfold. How do you think that is going to go?

<p>AMB. JOHN NEGROPONTE: Well, first it is an important issue. I
 wouldn't call it "the" overriding issue, by any means. I think
 the overriding issue is to move the democratic process in this
 country forward and yesterday was a major advance in that direction.
 

<p>Now, as far as the involvement of Sunni or any other groups,
 what we've heard from the political leaders who are candidates
 in this election is that they want to take an inclusive approach
 towards the future political life of this country. 

<p>So, I think you're going to see efforts to involve the Sunni
 in the new executive branch, through cabinet positions and the
 like, and I think there is also the intention to try and involve
 them in various ways in the drafting of a new constitution.
 

<p>Because under the interim constitution of Iraq, any combination
 of three provinces at the time of the referendum on the constitution
 can block ratification. So, it's very much in the interest of
 all concerned if only to get the constitution ratified to include
 representation from all groups.

<p>MARGARET WARNER: Are you personally in touch with senior members
 of what's been called the Sistani Slate, even though we know
 he was neither a candidate nor officially endorsed, but the
 United Iraqi Alliance, the Shiite-dominated slate, that is expected
 to get the greatest number of votes. I mean, do you have a personal
 reading of what their intentions are?

<p>AMB. JOHN NEGROPONTE: Well, we at various levels in our embassy,
 right down to our political reporting officers we have maintained
 contact with all segments of the Iraqi political spectrum and
 of course some of the members of the Sistani List are people
 who are either in the government - such as the finance minister,
 for example, or the vice president -- and others are individuals
 whom we knew when there was a - a governing council at the time
 of the coalition provisional authority, so I would say that
 we're quite well acquainted with representatives of that list
 and in fairly constant dialogue with them.

<p>Encouraging participation

<p>MARGARET WARNER: Now what about the Sunni leaders who urged a
 boycott? They have at least given interviews in which they said
 they want to be part of the process, but what more can you tell
 us about their intention? 

<p>AMB. JOHN NEGROPONTE: Well, there is no monolithic Sunni leadership
 to my understanding, which is perhaps one of the issues that
 has been a complicating factor. 

<p>But certainly we have maintained contact with a variety of leaders
 from the Al-Anbar and Nineveh Provinces, which is where many
 of these Sunnis reside. 

<p>I have myself, for example, been in occasional contact with the
 leader of the Iraqi Islamic Party, which is Sunni-dominated.
 So, again, we have reached out to those groups and intend to
 continue to do so in the weeks and months ahead.

<p>MARGARET WARNER: But do you think that - first of all - the fact
 of yesterday's election, the relatively high turnout, do you
 think this is going to from what you know make them feel more
 estranged and alienated or, in fact, encourage them that, you
 know, this train is leaving the station, to use an old political
 clich&eacute;, and they should get involved?

<p>AMB. JOHN NEGROPONTE: Right. I think it's actually encouraging
 them to want to get on the train. In fact, I think initially
 a number of them were really trying to test the system to see
 if they could somehow or another cause a delay in the elections.
 

<p>But when the inevitability of the elections became apparent,
 I think we saw a number of these Sunni groups and certainly
 Sunni voters want to participate more in the political process
 and for example members of some of the Sunni parties that were
 not actively involved in the election have already indicated
 to us that they would like in some way to be involved in the
 drafting of the constitution. 

<p>So rather than having a polarizing effect, as some have suggested,
 I think this election could well, in the end, have a unifying
 consequence.

<p> 

<p> 

<p> 

<p>MARGARET WARNER: And what do you think - again the fact of yesterday's
 election and the results means for the prospect of getting American
 troops out of Iraq? 

<p>AMB. JOHN NEGROPONTE: Well, first of all, it's certainly a very
 important step in terms of the government and the people of
 Iraq taking on even greater ownership for the management of
 their own affairs. 

<p>So it's been a very, very important advance towards political
 democracy. I think parallel to that one of our highest priorities
 going forward is going to be to train and equip and try to help
 motivate Iraqi armed forces, their military and their police
 forces, so that they can take on an ever -- a greater responsibility
 for their own security. 

<p>We'd like to see a gradual shift from us being out on the lead
 on security issues to the Iraqi forces being in the lead so
 that we can reduce our profile.

<p>MARGARET WARNER: Some of these parties started this campaign
 by saying they wanted U.S. troops out quickly. And that did
 seem to shift toward the end. 

<p>Again, how do you read their intentions - I'm talking now about
 for the United Iraqi Alliance, perhaps a couple of the other
 major parties, in terms of whether they want to at least start
 talking about a timetable for withdrawal?

<p>AMB. JOHN NEGROPONTE: Well, a timetable was mentioned in some
 of the campaign documents of some of these parties. But when
 we spoke to many of these political leaders, they clarified
 that they didn't want to mean to suggest that coalition forces
 should leave the country precipitously; in fact, many of them
 have said to us that they think that would be dangerous and
 would leave a serious vacuum. 

<p>On the other hand, I think they feel, and I think on this point
 we agree with them, that it is important that Iraqi forces themselves
 be enabled as rapidly as possible to take over the primary responsibility
 for their security and ultimately to take over full responsibility
 for the security situation in their own country. 

<p>And I think that's an objective that our two countries share
 in common.

<p> 

<p>Defending against attacks

<p> 

<p>MARGARET WARNER: I know you're not a military expert, but the
 interior minister was quoted or the interim interior minister
 was quoted yesterday - he thought it would take perhaps 18 months
 for the full Iraqi security forces to be able to handle things
 on their own? Does that sound reasonable to you?

<p>AMB. JOHN NEGROPONTE: Well, we've been reluctant to try and put
 a timetable on this to give a time estimate simply because we
 don't want to create some kind of expectation that then subsequently
 might lead to a disappointment. 

<p>But what I can assure you is that we really are working extremely
 hard on this issue of training, equipping, and motivating of
 the Iraqi armed forces. And I would give to you as an example
 the extremely good performance that they displayed yesterday
 in protecting these 5,300 polling centers throughout the country.
 

<p>The Iraqi forces deserve a tremendous amount of credit for the
 success of yesterday's election.

<p>MARGARET WARNER: Now this 72-hour lockdown does end tomorrow.
 Are you braced for insurgent attacks?

<p>AMB. JOHN NEGROPONTE: Well, one never knows exactly what to predict.
 Of course, there's been a pattern, a fairly steady pattern of
 violence in recent weeks and months. 

<p>Obviously, we're doing our best to control and stabilize those
 situations and hopefully some of the lessons learned from the
 experience of preparing for the elections will be helpful going
 forward. But I'd be very wary of trying to predict for you exactly
 what might happen in the next few days. 

<p>I think that it is reasonable to expect that this insurgency
 will continue for sometime to come and that the best way to
 deal with it is to keep steadily working away at it through
 political action, such as these elections, through training
 and equipping and motivating of their armed forces and the economic
 reconstruction activities that we have underway. 

<p>And I think through that combination of measures, I think that
 we over time will be able to effectively deal with the insurgency
 that Iraq is facing.
