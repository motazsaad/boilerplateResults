<h>1879 - The Tay Bridge Disaster

<p> 

<p> 

<p>Designed by Sir Thomas Bouch, the Tay Railway Bridge was opened
 in 1878. 

<p>The single-track bridge was a box construction with numerous
 box-section legs, up to 230ft apart, supporting the steam trains
 up to 88ft in the air as they snaked for almost two miles over
 the Tay and Perth-bound shipping. Bouch had not designed his
 structure with the estuary winds considered in his calculations,
 nor had the contractor been supervised to prevent his use of
 badly manufactured material. 

<p>These points were discovered after the bridge&#8217;s central
 sections failed during the stormy night of 28 December 1879
 while a train was crossing. The train, with seventy five passengers
 and crew, poured off the collapsing bridge into the icy river
 with all lives lost. 

<p>
 Bouch, who was held entirely responsible, could not take the
 strain either and died shortly after the inquiry. When travelling
 on the 1887 replacement bridge over the Tay, the bases of the
 original&#8217;s supporting legs can be seen along the eastern
 side, reaching out of the cold water, a disturbing sight on
 a stormy crossing. 

<p>William McGonagall remembers the night of the 28th well in his
 famous poem &#8216;Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay&#8217;.
