<h>Executive Summary (continued)

<h>Summary of Treasury&#146;s Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Forecasts

<p>This summary sets out the economic and fiscal outlook for the
 next three years. A number of risks to the outlook may lead
 to a significant change in the growth path. Scenarios for higher
 and lower than forecast growth provide illustration.

<h>The Economic Outlook

<h>Steady export-led growth on the back of a positive world outlook.

<p>Figure 1 &#150; GDP growth

<p>Despite contracting in the June 1999 quarter, the economy is
 set for solid expansion with quarterly growth expected to run
 somewhat above trend over the early part of the forecast period.
 Annual average growth is expected to be around 2&#189;% in the
 year to March 2000, 3&#189;% in the following two years, and
 3% in the final year of the forecast period.

<p>Conditions for growth remain positive. Stronger world demand
 and a more competitive exchange rate mean exports now count
 for a greater proportion of growth than at Budget time - although
 overall growth in the out years remains little changed.

<p>Global growth prospects have improved through this year. Trading
 partner growth is now expected to be 3% in both 1999 and 2000.
 For 1999 this marks a doubling on the growth expected at the
 start of the year. Monetary conditions also remain stimulatory
 with low interest rates and a competitive exchange rate.

<p>Robust growth in manufactured exports and tourism activity is
 expected to continue, underpinned by stronger global demand
 and a competitive exchange rate. The America&#146;s Cup and
 the Sydney Olympics give an additional boost to the tourism
 sector. Commodity exporters are expected to shake off the effects
 of the droughts and gain from recovering world commodity prices.

<h>Boost from strengthening labour market partly offset by price
 and debt pressures.

<p>Household spending is supported by steady employment and wage
 growth. Firms are expected to lift their demand for staff in
 line with a steadily growing economy. Employment growth peaks
 at an annual 2.7% in 2001. The unemployment rate falls to below
 6% in 2001/02. Incomes receive an additional fillip in the March
 2001 year from the planned tax cuts.

<p>However, in the near term households feel the pressure of rising
 oil prices. Over the medium-term, increasing debt levels and
 rising debt servicing costs see spending growth slow and savings
 modestly rebuilt.

<h>Modest tightening in monetary conditions.

<p>The economy is likely to run into capacity constraints by around
 late 2000. However, a modest monetary tightening wards off inflationary
 pressures. This keeps the economy on a sustainable growth path.

<p>Short-term interest rates are forecast to climb to 7.0% by the
 2002 year and the exchange rate is expected to show a modest
 rise. The continuing large current account deficit is assumed
 to limit the rise in the exchange rate.

<p>Rising oil prices are largely behind a spike in annual inflation
 to 2.7% in the year to March 2000. This is not, however, expected
 to lead to more sustained inflationary pressures.

<p>Figure 6 &#150; Current account

<p>Sources: Statistics New Zealand, The Treasury

<p>In the near term, the oil price rise and some one-off large imports,
 such as a frigate, and higher returns to foreign direct investment
 in New Zealand, see the current account deficit increase to
 8.3% of GDP. That is expected to improve over the forecast horizon,
 falling to 5.8% of GDP by the end of the period.

<h>The Fiscal Outlook

<h>Operating balance grows with revenue growth outpacing expense
 growth.

<p>Figure 7 &#150; Operating balance

<p>Source: The Treasury

<p>The 1998/99 operating balance of $1.8 billion was boosted by
 large one-off items including gains on sale of assets. Excluding
 the one-off items, the operating balance was around $150 million.

<p>The 1999/2000 operating balance of $14 million reflects:

<l>the absence of any similar large one-off items 

<l>lower SOE and Crown entity surpluses, with the recognition of
 the ACC outstanding claims liability (around $500 million)

<l>expense growth, mainly in social welfare, health and education
 (around $800 million)

<p>These effects are partly offset by:

<l>growth in tax revenue (around $1,200 million) arising from the
 economic recovery.

<p>Beyond 1999/2000 the operating balance rises, with revenue growth
 (averaging 4.8% a year) outpacing expense growth (averaging
 2.8% a year).

<p>As a percentage of GDP, expenses fall between 1999/2000 and 2002/03
 from 35% to 33%.

<p>Figure 8 &#150; Expenses ($ and % of GDP)

<p>In dollar terms, over the same period, expenses increase from
 $36 billion to $39 billion reflecting:

<l>growth in the provision for future initiatives of $1,460 million,
 providing for the cost of future policy decisions

<l>CPI indexation and beneficiary growth of around $800 million&#150;
 most growth is after 2001 when the New Zealand Superannuation
 (NZS) eligibility age settles at 65

<l>health and education spending increases of $800 million.

<h>Net debt is stable in dollar terms, but falls as a percentage
 of GDP, over the forecast period.

<p>Figure 9 &#150; Net debt (% of GDP and $)

<p>Source: The Treasury

<p>In 1998/99 net debt was $21.7 billion. Net debt rises in 1999/2000
 and 2000/01 before falling to slightly below its 1998/99 level.

<p>The rise reflects:

<l>an operating cash deficit

<l>increased capital investment for health, education and capital
 investment for At Work Insurance (1999/2000 only).

<p>Improving operating cash-flows drive the fall in 2001/02 and
 2002/03.

<p>As a percentage of GDP net debt falls from 21.8% to 17.8% between
 1998/99 and 2002/03 as nominal GDP grows.

<h>Net worth grows over the forecast period.

<p>Figure 10 &#150; Net worth

<p>Source: The Treasury

<p>In 1998/99 net worth fell from $10 billion to $6 billion. The
 fall reflects ARCIC&#146;s recognition of the future cost of
 already accepted ACC claims ($6.1 billion), partly offset by
 a $1.8 billion operating surplus.

<p>Beyond 1999/2000, net worth increases in line with operating
 balance surpluses.

<h>Compared to Budget, the operating balance is largely unchanged,
 but net debt and net worth improve.

<p>The operating balance forecasts are largely unchanged from the
 Budget. The balance is $50 million higher in 1999/2000, $6 million
 higher in 2000/01 and $155 million higher 2001/02, reflecting:

<l>the removal of the contingency expense provision for legal liabilities
 ($100 million a year).

<p>These effects are largely offset by:

<l>a downward revision to the estimated 1998/99 corporate tax base
 following higher than forecast overpayments of corporate tax.
 This impacts on all years.

<l>tax rate reductions. By the end of the forecast period these
 are largely funded from the provision for future initiatives.
 The remainder lowers the operating balance by $245 million,
 $165 million and $85 million in 2000/01, 2001/02 and 2002/03
 respectively.

<p>Net worth forecasts, however, are stronger by between $650 million
 and $830 million over the forecast period largely reflecting
 the lower ACC outstanding claims liability valuation at 30 June
 1999.

<p>Net debt forecasts are lower by between $100 and $300 million.
 These improvements largely reflect a better starting position
 in 1998/99 than forecast in the Budget and stronger dividend
 flows from SOEs in 1999/2000.

<h>Risks and Scenarios

<p>The Central Forecast embodies a steady export-led expansion.
 As always there are risks and uncertainties surrounding this
 central track, raising the prospect of the economy following
 quite different growth paths to that presented here. Stronger
 world growth, for example, could see additional strength in
 our economy over the first part of the forecast period. The
 economy would hit capacity constraints sooner, producing a sharper
 cycle than forecast.

<p>But there are also risks around the sustainability of the current
 global recovery: most prominently, the possibility of a sharp
 correction in equity prices in the US. Slower world growth would
 undermine the strength of New Zealand&#146;s recovery leading
 to a more modest growth path than envisaged here.

<p>There are also risks associated with the domestic economy. The
 June quarter GDP outturn has raised the possibility of some
 near term weakness. Over the medium term it is by no means certain
 how consumers will react to higher debt.

<p>If any of these circumstances were to develop differently than
 allowed for in the Central Forecast, they could produce outcomes
 where economic growth is stronger or weaker than embodied in
 the Central Forecast. This would have flow on effects for the
 fiscal forecasts.

<p>Examples of a high growth (Stronger World Economy) scenario and
 a low growth (Weaker World and Household Sector) scenario help
 illustrate some of these risks.

<p>Figure 12 &#150; Operating balance

<p>Alternative economic scenarios lead to alternative fiscal outcomes,
 mainly because of differences in the outlook for nominal GDP,
 a key driver of tax revenue. The Stronger World Economy scenario
 leads to a stronger operating balance throughout the forecast
 period. In contrast, the Weaker World and Household Sector scenario
 sees the operating balance record modest deficits in the first
 two years of the forecast period, but return to surplus over
 the final two years.
