<p>
 Out on the wiley, windy moors
We'd roll and fall in green
You
 had a temper, like my jealousy
Too hot, too greedy
How could
 you leave me?
When I needed to possess you
I hated you, I loved
 you too

<p>
Bad dreams in the night
They told me I was going to lose the
 fight
Leave behind my wuthering, wuthering
Wuthering Heights

<p>
 Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy come home
I'm so cold, let me in-a-your
 window 

<p>
Oh it gets dark, it gets lonely
On the other side from you
I
 pine a lot, I find the lot
Falls through without you
I'm coming
 back love, cruel Heathcliff
My one dream, my only master

<p>
Too long I roam in the night
I'm coming back to his side to
 put it right
I'm coming home to wuthering, wuthering
Wuthering
 Heights

<p>
Oh let me have it, let me grab your soul away
Oh let me have
 it, let me grab your soul away
You know it's me, Cathy

<p>
 How I'm moved, how you move me
With your beauty's potency
You
 give me life, please don't let me go
You crush the lily in my
 soul

<p>from "Moving"

<p>
 The candle burning over your shoulder
Is throwing shadows from
 your saxophone
A surly lady in tremor
The stars that climb from
 her bowels 
Those stars make towers on vowels
You'll never know
 that you had all of me
You'll never see the poetry you've stirred
 in me
Of all the stars I've seen that shine so brightly
I've
 never known or felt, in myself, so rightly

<p>from "Saxophone Song"

<p>
 Soul birds of a feather flock together

<p>from "Strange Phenomena"

<p>
 And then I find out, when I take a good look up
There's a hole
 in the sky with a big eyeball
Calling me

<p>
I got no limbs
I'm like a feather on the wind
Well I'm not sure
 if I want to be up here at all
And I'd like to be back on the
 ground
But I don't know how to get down

<p>from "Kite"

<p>
 I hear him before I go to sleep
And focus on the day that's
 been
I realise he's there when I turn the light off
And turn
 over
Nobody knows about my man
They think he's lost on some
 horizon
And suddenly I find myself
Listening to a man I've never
 known before
Telling me about the sea
All his love, 'till eternity

<p>from "The Man With The Child In His Eyes"

<p>
 All the colours look brighter now
Everything they say seems
 to sound new 
Slipping into tomorrow too quick
Yesterday always
 too good to forget
Stop the swing of the pendulum, let us through!

<p>from "Oh To Be In Love"

<p>
 You came out of the night
Wearing a mask in white colour
My
 eyes were shining on the wine
And your aura

<p>
The thoughts of you sends me shivery
I'm dressed in lace sailing
 down a black reverie

<p>from "L'Amour Looks Something Like You"

<p>
 I must work on my mind
For now I realize that everyone of us
Has
 a heaven inside

<p>
They open doorways that I thought were shut for good
They read
 me Gurdjieff and Jesu
They build up my body
Break me emotionally,
 it's nearly killing me
But what a lovely feeling!
I love the
 whirling of the Dervishes
I love the beauty of rare innocence
You
 don't need no crystal ball
Don't fall for a magic wand
We humans
 got it all
We perform the miracles

<p>from "Them Heavy People"

<p>
 Lost in your men and the games you play
Trying to prove that
 you're better, woman
But you needn't get heavy with them
Like
 it or not, we were build tough
Because we're woman

<p>
No, we never die for long
 While we've got that little life
 to live for
Where it's hid inside, no, we never die for long
Oh-woman,
 two in one
There's room for a life in your womb, woman
Inside
 of you, can be two, woman

<p>from "Room For The Life"

<p>
 I've pulled down my lace and the chintz
Oh, do you know you
 have the face of a genius
I'll send your love to Zeus
Oh, by
 the time you read this
I'll be well in touch

<p>
I'm giving it all in a moment or two
I'm giving it all in a
 moment for you
I'm giving it all
Giving it, giving it, giving
 it
This kicking here inside makes me leave you behind
No more
 under the quilt to keep you warm
Your sister I was born, you
 must lose me
Like an arrow shot in the killer storm

<p>
You and me on the bobbing knee
Didn't we cry at that old mythology
 he'd read
I will come home again, but not until
The sun and
 moon meet on yon hill

<p>"The Kick Inside"
(really beautiful song .... about incest
I
 admire Kate's lyrical courage, and talent)

<p>
 I spend a lot of my time looking at blue
The colour of my room
 and my mood
Blue on the walls
Blue out of my mouth
The sort
 of blue
Between clouds when the sun comes out
The sort of blue
In
 those eyes you get hung up about

<p>
The more I think about sex
The better it gets
Here we have a
 purpose in life
Good for the blood circulation
Good for releasing
 the tension
The root of our reincarnations

<p>from "Symphony In Blue"

<p>
 I've been told
When I get older
That I'll understand it all
But
 I'm not sure if I want to

<p>from "In Search Of Peter Pan"

<p>
 When the actor reaches his death
You know it's not for real
He
 just holds his breath
But he always dives too soon
Too fast
 to save himself
He'll never make the screen
He'll never make
 "The Sweeney"
 Be that movie queen
He's too busy hitting the
 vaseline

<p>from "Wow"

<p>
 In the warm room
Her perfume reaches you
Eventually you'll
 fall for her
Down you'll go to where the mellow wallows

<p>
In the warm room
You'll fall into her like a pillow
Her thighs
 are soft as marshallows
Say hello to the soft mush of her hollows

<p>from "In The Warm Room"

<p>
 She wanted to test her husband
She knew exactly what to do
A
 pseudonym to fool him
She couldn't have made a worse move
She
 sent him scented letters
And he received them with a strange
 delight
Just like his wife
But how she was before the tears
And
 how she was before the years flew by
And how she was when she
 was beautiful
She signed the letter

<p>
All yours, Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya

<p>
She wanted to take it further
So she arranged a place to go
To
 see if he
Would fall for her incognito
And when he laid eyes
 on her
He got the feeling they had met before
Uncanny how she
Reminds
 him of his little lady
Capacity to give him all he needs
Just
 like his wife before she freezed on him
Just like his wife when
 she was beautiful
He shouted out, I'm...

<p>
All yours, Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka-ya-ya 

<p>"Babooshka"

<p>
 One of the band told me last night
That music is all that he's
 got in his life
So where does it go
Surely not with his soul
Will
 all of his licks and his R & B blow away

<p>from "Blow Away"

<p>
 The whims that we're weeping for
Our parents would be beaten
 for
Leave the breast and then the nest
And then regret you ever
 left

<p>from "All We Ever Look For"

<p>
 Our little Army boy
Is coming home from B.F.P.O.
I've a bunch
 of purple flowers
To decorate a mammy's hero
Mourning in the
 aerodrome
The weather warmer, he is colder
Four men in uniform
 to carry home
My little soldier

<p>
What could he do? Should have been a rock star
But he didn't
 have the money for a guitar
What could he do? Should have been
 a politician
But he never had a proper education
What could
 he do? Should have been a father
But he never even made it to
 his twenties
What a waste
Army Dreamers

<p>
Tears o'er a tin box
Oh Jesus Christ, he wasn't to know
Like
 a chicken with a fox
He cannot win the war with ego
Give the
 kid the pick of pips
And give him all your stripes and ribbons
Now
 he's sitting in his hole
He might as well have ribbons and bows

<p>"Army Dreamers"

<p>
 December will be magic again
Light up the candlelights
To conjure
 Mr. Wilde
Into the silent night
Ooh, it's quiet inside
Here
 in Oscar's mind

<p>from "December Will Be Magic Again"

<p>
 I've been doing it for years
My goal is moving near
It says
 "Look I'm over here"
Then it up and disappears

<p>from "Sat In Your Lap"

<p>
 My door was never locked
Until one day a trigger come - cocking

<p>
 Narrow mind would persecute it
Die a little to get to it

<p>
I kept it in a cage
Watched it weeping, but I made it stay

<p>
We let the weirdness in

<p>from "Leave It Open"

<p>
 With a hired plane
And no names mentioned
Tonight's the night
 of the flight
Before you know
I'll be over the water like a
 swallow
There's no risk
I'll whisk them up
In no moonlight
And
 though pigs can fly
They'll never find me
Posing as the night
And
 I'm home before the morning

<p>
In Malta catch a swallow
For all of the guilty to let them free
Wings
 fill the window
And they beat and bleed
They hold the sky
On
 the other side
Of border lines

<p>
 Give me a break
Ooh let me fly
Give me something to show
For
 my miserable life
Give me something to take
Would you break
 even my wings
Just like a swallow
Let me, let me go

<p>from "Night Of The Swallow"

<p>
 The first time I died
Was in the arms of good friends of mine
They
 kiss me with tears
They hadn't been near me for years
Say why
 do it now
When I won't be around, I'm going out

<p>from "All The Love"

<p>
 You're like my yo-yo
That glowed in the dark
What made it special

 Made it dangerous
So I bury it and forget

<p>
Everytime it rains
 You're here in my head
Like the sun coming
 out
Ooh I just know that something good is going to happen
And
 I don't know when
But just saying it could even make it happen

<p>from "Cloudbusting"

<p>
 It's wonderful
Everything so white
The river has frozen over
Not
 a soul on the ice
Only me skating fast
I'm speeding past trees
 leaving
Little lines in the ice
Cutting out little lines
In
 the ice 
Splitting, splitting sound
Silver heels spitting, spitting
 snow
There's something moving under
Under the ice
Moving under
 ice
Through water
Trying to get out of the cold water
"It's
 me"
 Something, someone
Help them
"It's me"

<p>"Under Ice"
(from "The Ninth Wave", the concept side of the album
 "Hounds Of Love"
the woman is in the river, near drowning, trying
 to stay awake)

<p>
 This moment in time
It doesn't belong to you
It belongs to
 me
And to your little boy and your little girl
And the one hand
 clapping
Where on your palm is my little line
When you're written
 in mine
As an old memory

<p>from "Jig Of Life"
(another part of "The Ninth Wave"
in a dream,
 the woman sees her older self
this is the older version talking
 to her
man, I love this woman's lyrics!)

<p>
 Just being alive
It can really hurt
And these moments given
Are
 a gift from time

<p>from "Moments Of Pleasure"

<p>
 See how the flower leans instinctively toward the light
See
 how the heart reaches out instinctively
For no reason but to
 touch

<p>from "Reaching Out"

<p>
 They say that the Devil is a charming man
And just like you
 I bet he can dance

<p>from "Heads We're Dancing"

<p>
 As the people here grow colder
I turn to my computer
And spend
 my evenings with it
Like a friend

<p>from "Deeper Understanding"

<p>
 I know you have a little life in you yet
I know you have a
 lot of strength left

<p>
I should be crying
But I just can't let it show
 I should be
 hoping
But I can't stop thinking
Of all the things we should've
 said
That were never said
All the things we should've done
That
 we never did
All the things that you needed from me
All the
 things that you wanted for me
All the things that I should've
 given
But I didn't
