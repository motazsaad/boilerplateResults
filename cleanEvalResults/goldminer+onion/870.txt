<p> By now the body language was starting to scream "?&*Â£!". Having
 reached the fringe at the 12th, he needed three raps of his
 misfiring putter to finish the job. It was head in hands time.
 

<p> The worse his putting got, the longer the pre-putt routine became.
 The only angle Faldo wasn't checking could only have been provided
 by the Royal Bank of Scotland blimp. 

<p> But despite - or perhaps because of - these navigational aids,
 Faldo's ball continued to show all the homing instincts of a
 teenager at a great party. 

<p> Meanwhile, Faldo's playing partner, Darren Clarke, was having
 an erratic day on the dance floor. 

<p> The 36-year-old Ulsterman was almost as bad on the greens as
 Faldo on the first two days, but on Saturday improved to 27
 putts. 

<p> Faldo, however, did not miss anything as short as Clarke did
 on the 11th - an 18-inch tiddler stayed up to bring a second
 straight bogey for the Northern Irish star. 

<p> At that point it looked as though the red mists would roll in
 and engulf Clarke. 

<p> He had birdied four straight from the fifth to reach five under
 and then saved a superb par after a penalty drop at the ninth.
 But the bogeys threatened to wreck all that good work. 

<p> Thankfully, Clarke's mood is less connected to his golf these
 days, and an enormous drive and two putts at the 12th got his
 momentum going forward again. 

<p>Clarke takes a more laid-back attitude to golf these days

<p> It got even better at the next. Having spent the first two days
 bemoaning his prodigal putter, Clarke sank a roller-coaster
 from 20 yards for birdie. 

<p> Even Faldo got excited about that one, although the smile disappeared
 when his six-foot par putt stayed above ground. 

<p> The next four holes brought a further birdie for Clarke and
 anguish for Faldo, who had now started contorting his body into
 unusual yoga shapes between shots. 

<p> But the Englishman had the last laugh, well, smile. Both players
 drove the 18th green but only Faldo could cross the huge putting
 surface in two shots for birdie. 

<p> That left him on three under, three behind Clarke and eight
 off Woods' overnight lead. 

<p> Most almost-48-year-olds would be more than happy to be able
 to say the same, but Faldo isn't most almost-48-year-olds. 

<p> Just as Nicklaus only came to St Andrews because he thought
 he could play four competitive rounds, Faldo only plays because
 he still thinks he can win. 

<p> But while it is difficult to imagine Faldo ever agreeing to
 a ceremonial role, his days as a potential winner have gone.
 The reassessment of pre-event goals may be a tricky one for
 this most competitive of sportsmen.
