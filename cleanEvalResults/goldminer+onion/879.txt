<h>Lookin' Great and Feelin' Fine...

<p>Dude, Lita. Yer Mom's totally fuggly.

<p>... we're the class of '89! Sorry, but I am genetically hard-wired
 to embrace and write about all musical nostalgia, even when
 it dates and debases me. This unique trick comes to us via Roxanne
 and Jim Henley; finding the top 100 singles from the year of
 your high school graduation.

<p>So, with all 100-long lists, I started off by thinking of some
 basic classifications: "That's a Kick-ass Song," "Pretty Good,"
 "Semi-Listenable," "Makes Me Want to Kill Myself," and "Makes
 Me Want to Kill Myself After a Long Killing Spree." Then a took
 a closer look at the list from 1989 (graduation photo here for
 confirmation, one of many embarrassing pictures on my Flickr
 site) and decided that about 90% of the songs would fall in
 the bottom category. Who knew that NKOTB, Roxette, and Milli
 Vanilli could all blow up in the same year? So, in order to
 keep it positive, I'm just going to list the songs I could listen
 to a 30-second snippet of without going homicidal/suicidal:

<p>36. Buffalo Stance, Neneh Cherry 
 42. Bust A Move, Young M.C.
 47. Love Shack, B-52's. On second thought, no. Not any more.

 51. So Alive, Love and Rockets. Just barely.
 58. Sowing The
 Seeds Of Love, Tears For Fears 
 66. In Your Room, Bangles 

 68. Love Song, Cure 
 71. Patience, Guns N' Roses 
 74. Welcome
 To The Jungle, Guns N' Roses 
 76. Stand, R.E.M. 
 77. Close
 My Eyes Forever, Lita Ford 
 83. This Promise, When In Rome
 
 86. Paradise City, Guns N' Roses 
 91. Poison, Alice Cooper
 
 100. Keep On Movin', Soul II Soul

<p>Only The Cure and Guns n' Roses remain on my digital jukebox,
 and their offerings are far from my favorites. That's not to
 say that I graduated into a wasteland; the following albums
 were released that year (in addition to all those alterna-albums
 that I can't possibly think of):

<p>Bad Religion "No Control" // Beastie Boys "Paul's Boutique" //
 Camper Van Beethoven "Key Lime Pie" // Elvis Costello "Spike"
 // Faith No More "The Real Thing" // Lenny Kravitz "Let Love
 Rule" // Neil Young "Freedom" // New Order "Technique" // Nine
 Inch Nails // Nine Inch Nails "Pretty Hate Machine" // Nirvana
 "Bleach" // Public Image Limited "9" // Red Hot Chili Peppers
 "Mother's Milk" // Stevie Ray Vaughn "In Step" // The Flaming
 Lips "Telepathic Surgery" // The Pogues "Peace And Love"

<p>Then I got to further "thinking"... MTV and Top 40 radio have
 always been geared towards middle-schoolers. I don't think that
 music got appreciably worse from during my high school years,
 but I'll bet that I retain more of an appreciation for 1985's
 unadulterated crap (same list in the extended entry)...

<p>5. I Feel For You, Chaka Khan

 John Oates

 Fears

 10. Take On Me,
 A-Ha 
 12. Easy Lover, Phil Collins and Philip Bailey 
 16.

 18. St. Elmo's Fire
 (Man In Motion), John Parr 
 21. Shout, Tears For Fears

 62. Smooth

 63. In My House, Mary Jane Girls 
 68. Voices

 70. Would I Lie To You?, Eurythmics 

 71. Be Near Me, ABC

 Waves

 Lennon

<p>I'm a year behind you, but the difference is striking. A whole
 lot of Wilson Phillips and Michael Bolton that year.

<p>I graduated in 89 too. I remember the late 80s being bad, but
 not that bad. So much stuff I had almost forgotten about. Also,
 some hair bands, but not as many as I remember. And reading
 into the 90s it's amazing stuff like Rod Stewart and Genesis
 were still stinking up the beginning of that decade. For some
 reason I thought they faded away after the mid 80s.

<p>c/o '89 here too (I did my high school time in Tampa's colorful
 and rustic Cracktown neighborhood - oh, the memories). I must
 admit that it is truly humbling to look at both of those lists
 and think, my God - I used to like some of that shit!

<p>9. Baby, I Love Your Way/Freebird, Will To Power

<p>I actually saw them perform (well, sort of) this abortion live,
 during Grad Nite at Disney World. Other "performers" (by which
 I mean, lip-synchers) that evening included Samantha Fox, New
 Kids on the Block, and Information Society.

<p>Actually, there was someone else too, but he / they were so awful
 I was apparently forced to repress the memory.

<p>From 1972, not just one, but two versions of a Coke commercial
 (#93 and #97):

<p>2. Alone Again (Naturally), Gilbert O'Sullivan 
 3. American
 Pie, Don McLean 
 5. Candy Man, Sammy Davis Jr. 
 8. Baby Don't
 Get Hooked On Me, Mac Davis

 10.
 Daddy Dont You Walk So Fast, Wayne Newton 
 12. Brandy (You're
 A Fine Girl), Looking Glass 
 15. My Ding-A-Ling, Chuck Berry
 
 20. Ben, Michael Jackson
 21. The Lion Sleeps Tonight, Robert
 John 
 22. Outa-space, Billy Preston 
 27. Song Sung Blue, Neil
 Diamond 
 28. A Horse With No Name, America 
 30. Precious And
 Few, Climax 
 32. Nights In White Satin, Moody Blues 
 36. Down
 By The Lazy River, Osmonds 
 50. Hold Your Head Up, Argent 

 55. The Happiest Girl In The Whole U.S.A., Donna Fargo

 and The Medicine Show 
 68. Puppy Love, Donny Osmond

 72. Joy, Apollo 100 
 74. Never

 75. Kiss An Angel Good Morning,

 91. Roundabout, Yes 
 93. I'd Like To
 Teach The World To Sing, New Seekers 
 97. I'd Like To Teach
 The World To Sing, Hillside Singers 

<p>I graduated in '62 in SoCal. People wouldn't ride in my beautiful
 '48 Plymouth because I listened to country music. I still do,
 but it has expanded to "Americana". Wish I still had the car,
 too.

<p>at the entirely opposite end of the spectrum, i think 1989 also
 marked the release of ministry's 'mind is a terrible thing to
 taste', skinny puppy's 'rabies', and possibly the revolting
 cocks 'beers, steers, and queers', of which i know at least
 this third one has fond memories in the thc-saturated nether-regions
 of good sir norbizness' brain.

<p>I can listed to almost all of the top 5 in '88 w/out becoming
 murderous /suicidal:
 1. Faith, George Michael
 2. Need You
 Tonight, INXS
 3. Got My Mind Set On You, George Harrison
 4.
 Never Gonna Give You Up, Rick Astley
 5. Sweet Child O'Mine,
 Guns N Roses

<p>- but within the top 10 a song that instantly qualifies:
 9.
 Hands To Heaven, Breathe

<p>I graduated in '92. The #1 song of that year? Why, the execrable,
 momentously sappy "End of the Road" by that great Bell Biv Devoe
 find, Boyz II Men.

<p>Though the year is somewhat saved by the #2 song, Sir Mix A-Lot's
 timeless paean to the female posterior, "Baby Got Back".

<p>"Smells Like Teen Spirit" - like it or not, arguably one of the
 most important and influential songs of the 90s - checks in
 at #32. Here are some of the songs that checked in ahead of
 Nirvana:

<l>3. "Jump", Kris Kross - Jesus, put your clothes on right. 

<l>4. "Save the Best for Last", Vanessa Williams - post-Penthouse
 scandal, pre-ProActiv pimping.

<l>6. "Tears in Heaven", Eric Clapton - I'm sympathetic to the devastating
 loss this song was inspired by, but dammit! Remember Cream,
 Eric? Do you remember that?

<l>8. "Under the Bridge", Red Hot Chili Peppers - this actually
 deserves to be pretty high on the list, but above Nirvana? Methinks
 not.

<l>9. "All 4 Love", Color Me Badd - there simply isn't enough snark
 left in the world to address this.

<l>12. "To Be With You", Mr. Big - the official death knell of the
 power ballad. Thankfully.

<l>14. "Black or White", Michael Jackson - well, Jacko? Which are
 you?

<l>15. "Achy Breaky Heart", Billy Ray Cyrus - monster mullet and
 the birth of line dancing. Kee-rist.

<l>18. "Life Is A Highway", Tom Cochrane - No, Tom. I really do
 not want to ride it all night long, thankyouverymuch.

<l>21. "This Used To Be My Playground", Madonna - Ugh. Sentimental
 tripe. Madonna at her worst.

<p>And at #33, the immortal Bobby Brown with "Humpin' Around", beating
 the truly excellent "Tennessee" by Arrested Development by seven
 places. Oy. Vey.

<p>I do remember 1992 being this massive transition year, with the
 slow, embarrassing death of hair metal, the rise of grunge/alt-rock,
 the growing popularity of rap and hip-hop, the glorious last
 gasps of Richard Marx and Phil Collins... but, sweet Sky Fairy,
 that's a painful list.

<p>I'm pretty sure that was before 1989, but I could be wrong (heavy
 chemical use in those days may have, um, modified certain memories
 to the point where they bear no semblance to actual events).

<p>From Senior Year High School 1976, songs I can listen to without
 going nuts:

<p> 5. Play That Funky Music, Wild Cherry 
 15. Love Hangover, Diana
 Ross 
 33. Golden Years, David Bowie 
 51. Dream On, Aerosmith
 
 69. This Masquerade, George Benson 
 78. Got To Get You Into
 My Life, Beatles 
 93. Tear The Roof Off The Sucker, Parliament
 
 99. Squeeze Box, The Who

<p>
 when I was 13 in 1971, actually some great songs I still like:

<p> 2. Maggie May / (Find A) Reason To Believe, Rod Stewart 
 9.
 Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me), Temptations 
 18.
 Brown Sugar, Rolling Stones 
 21. What's Going On, Marvin Gaye
 
 55. Proud Mary, Ike and Tina Turner 
 62. Mercy Mercy Me (The
 Ecology), Marvin Gaye 
 81. I Hear You Knocking, Dave Edmunds
 
 84. Won't Get Fooled Again, Who 
 89. Theme From "Shaft",
 Isaac Hayes

<p>Conclusion: popular music was much better and much worse when
 I was younger. I think that's continued, less really goo or
 really bad stuff, much more mediocrity.

<p>Ok folk, lets first settle this Revolting Cocks thing. Beers,
 Steers & Queers" [album] (available on LP/Picture Disc 12"/CS/CD)

<p>CS: WaxTrax! Records (WAXCS 7063) 1990

<p>Not 1993, '89 etc. Secondly, let me say that I knew 1983 sucked
 musically, but Frank Stallone? Christ, the fact that Frank made
 it into ANY 100 list that wasn't entitled "100 Most (Pathetic)
 (Trite) (Grotesque).....All Hail Norbizness.

<p>Ahhhh, Revolting Cocks. I remember getting kicked out of high
 school for wearing a Cocks t-shirt.

<p>Why is it that these lists, which document the best selling singles,
 are always remarked upon with scorn? Not that they shouldn't
 be, mind you, but tons of people listened to this crap so why
 is everyone afraid to admit it? Or are the people who listen
 to crap like this not into blogs? It's a mystery.

<p>For the record, my 1987 list only has about 6 that are even passable
 and a whole bunch that I have never heard.
