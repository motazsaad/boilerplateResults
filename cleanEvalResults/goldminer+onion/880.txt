<h>Lucky Random Eleven Friday Musical Self-Audit.

<p>If you've never heard "Trans-Europe Express" as a rhumba with
 xylophones, you don't know what you're missing (#3).

<p>It's Friday, and time to gauge your intrinsic worth as a human
 being on this planet via the PAINFUL. MUSICAL. SELF-AUDIT (check
 previous editions in the Musique Non-Stop category for examples).
 Fire up the jukebox, don't skip over anything, and rate the
 first eleven tunes that pop up...

<p>1. "You've Never Seen Me Cry" The Flatlanders. The reunited band
 of legend from Lubbock, Texas plays a laid-back country ballad
 with lead vocals by one of the most unique singers in existence,
 Jimmie Dale Gilmore. 7/10.

<p>2. "Ghost Riders in the Sky" Dick Dale. One of the four or so
 versions of this song I have on the jukebox. About as kick-ass
 as his cover of "Hava Negila," so I suppose you could use both
 at a cowboy bar mitzvah. 8/10.

<p>3. "Chocolatina" Senor Coconut y su Conjunto. A rare non-Kraftwerk
 cover by this Latin-tinged enigma (actually a German DJ). Apparently
 he's taking on some Thriller-era Michael Jackson covers now.
 7/10.

<p>4. "Peace in the Valley" Sam Cooke (and the Soul Stirrers). Basically
 a lo-fi, a capella rendering of the gospel standard. Nothing
 special, even with one of the best voices of all time. 6/10.

<p>5. "Johnny Feelgood" Liz Phair. Just the right amount of synth
 sounds, rollicking guitar, and really disturbing lyrics. 8/10.

<p>6. "Mountain Man" Dinosaur Jr. An early, sloppy, grungy slab
 of something, with duelling crappy vocals by J. Mascis and Lou
 Barlow, in all likelihood. I'm not going to research it. 4/10.

<p>7. "Startin' Up A Posse" Anthrax. Oh Lord. Can a song with the
 background vocal "cunty cunty cunty cunt," even in regard to
 the declining PMRC, really rate that high, even with the "and
 this song ain't sexist, either!" disclaimer? It was a "Killer
 B-side" for a reason. 3/10.

<p>8. "Clover Over Dover" Blur. One of my favorite pieces of decade-mixing
 Britpop (anything with a lead harpsichord line scores points
 in my book) from a band I wish was playing instead of Oasis
 or Coldplay at the Austin City Limits music festival, not that
 it matters because all the tickets for that day sold out anyway.
 Fuck the Austin City Limits festival and their $55 day passes
 anyway. 9/10.

<p>9. "I Can't Stand Up For Falling Down" Sam & Dave. Performed
 as a real gut-wrenching ballad here (written by Isaac Hayes);
 I would have preferred the quicker pace of the Elvis Costello
 cover (but with the impeccable vocals of Mr. Moore and Mr. Prater).
 5/10.

<p>10. "I Hate Alternative Rock" Bob Mould. And I hate this song.
 Did you borrow Eddie Van Halen's power screwdriver or something?
 Sorry, Bob. 3/10.

<p>11. "Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Spacecraft" Babes in
 Toyland. A strange voyage for this song, from Klaatu to the
 Carpenters to riot-grrrl pioneers "If I Were a Carpenter" cover
 album. In your mind you have capacities, you know? Works for
 about two minutes. 5/10.

<p>5.9/10. I need to upgrade. Suggestions welcome! You previously
 shouted your favorites at me with comments to this post, so
 there's no need to repeat. 

<p>1. Stereolab, "Motoroller Scalatron" -- One of my favorite Stereolab
 tunes, a bouncer that builds slowly and moogily. 8/10

<p>2. Arcade Fire, "Haiti" -- I just saw these guys last night at
 Summerstage in Central Park. The show itself was solid, but
 for the encore they brought out David Bowie. Wow. Game, set,
 match: Arcade Fire. 9/10

<p>3. Boy Blue, "Joe Lee's Rock" -- You know Moby's song "Find My
 Baby"? This is the original blues tune that yielded the "I'm
 gonna find my baby" line for that. It's cool as a Lomax field
 recording, I suppose, but not really that great a song on its
 own. 5/10

<p>4. Sons of the Pioneers, "Old Man Atom" -- This is a phenomenally
 cool, 1940s country, anti-nuclear protest song. You read that
 correctly. Just amazing. 10./10

<p>5. Pat Benatar, "We Belong" -- Yeah, that's right. Pat Benatar.
 4/10

<p>6. War, "Nappy Head (Theme from 'Ghetto Man')" -- As far as blaxploitation
 themes go, this one is a stone cold killer. 7/10

<p>7. Overlord, "Love Goes Home to Paris in the Spring" -- Found
 this on a website devoted to Magnetic Fields covers. The novelty
 is nice, but I just wind up wishing it were the original. 5/10

<p>8. Johnny Cash, "Mister Garfield" -- I can't believe he recorded
 a song about the assassination of James Garfield, and I can't
 believe it's this great. The chorus is a happily repeated "Mister
 Garfield's been shot down, shot down, shot down! Mister Garfield's
 been shot down low!" It sounds like it's from a Broadway musical
 gone horribly, horribly awry. 8/10

<p>9. Jimmy Castor Bunch, "Bertha Butt Boogie" -- One of the many,
 many Bertha Butt appearances in the funk cosmos of Jimmy Castor.
 In their prime, this band must've taken in more drugs than the
 DEA. 9/10

<p>10. Rev. Horton Heat, "Where in the Hell Did You Go with My Toothbrush?"
 -- Nice change of pace from the Reverend. 7/10

<p>11. Death Cab for Cutie, "Marching Bands of Manhattan" -- This
 is off the new album, and hasn't soaked in quite enough yet.
 Still, I thinks I likes it. 7/10

<p>That's a 7.2/10. Christ, that's the exact same score I got at
 my place. Looks like I'm doomed to the life of a C-minus student.
 Hello, White House!

<p>Never heard of Señor Coconut til I dropped in on a concert at
 the Roskilde Festival ...2001 I guess. Was actually just passing
 by on my way to The Bad Seeds, playing at the opposite end of
 the square, and never got any further. A tent full of happily
 stoned people doing the We Are the Robots Cha-Cha-Cha was far
 better for my soul than the gloomy mr. Cave, anyway.

<p>That was a good year, btw. First time I saw Manu Chao live, was
 introduced to Ozomatli, and was blown away at a completely fucking
 fantastic concert by T-Model Ford.

<p>Otto, I'm still kicking myself for getting talked out of putting
 "Bertha Butt Boogie" on the wedding reception CD I gave the
 DJ. That would've been boss.

<p>"Ecstasy Blues," Gert Wilden & His Orchestra -- Not as cool as
 it sounds, but still pretty cool. 7/10

<p>"Tsunami," Southern All Stars -- Imagine crappy '80s balladry
 sung in overwrought Japanese. Sound cool to you? Me, neither.
 3/10

<p>"Look Thru the Eyes of a Fool," Roy Wood -- Mindnumbingly catchy,
 yet stunningly sucky. 3/10

<p>"Glory Days," Bruce Springsteen -- The people in this song seemed
 so old to me when this was on the radio, but The Boss was only
 a couple of years older than I am now when he wrote this. Still
 not a particularly cool song, though. 4/10

<p>"Running You and Me," The Pretty Things -- Cool acoustic guitar
 runs and vinyl hiss make this tune by the more British Rolling
 Stones a solid 7/10.

<p>"If You were Still Around," John Cale -- God, this is depressing.
 6/10

<p>"Bog People," Xiu Xiu -- This guy rules. 8/10

<p>"Backwater," Brian Eno -- So does this guy. 8/10

<p>"Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)," Journey -- This may not be all
 that cool, but there's no denying the awesome majesty of this
 windblown arena rock masterpiece. 4/10

<p>"I Was Young When I Left Home," Bob Dylan -- Yes, and you were
 young when you recorded this song, too. 7/10

<p>"Pump Up The Volume," M/A/R/R/S -- I was totally cutting out
 some lines at my desk when this came on, dude. 9/10

<p>I'll suggest Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings for soul music, four
 tet for "intelligent electronic music," whatever that means
 (great song: smile around the face). I'll second Xiu Xiu as
 some good but strange music.

<p>Finally, I'll submit The Lovemakers for fun dance music now and
 embarrassment when you try and decide why this was a good idea
 five years in the future.
