<p>I picked up a copy of Wired magazine with your pic on the cover
 and read the Firefox article on my flight to Florida. I just
 recently downloaded firefox when a friend emailed me the link
 about a month ago.

<p>What I found intriguing about the article in Wired was the security
 issue and the stark contrast between the time it takes for MS
 programmers to fix an IE bug vs. the developers who team up
 to fix an firefox bug in a percentage of the time.

<p>I believe an analogy can be made regarding the critical importance
 of international cooperation (working in teams as opposed to
 the hegemony of working unilaterally) when it comes to fighting
 the worst ills of our present age such as drug trafficking,
 terrorism and the like. 

<p>In the NY Times article last year which featured Senator John
 Kerry on the cover, Kerry said as much but instead amidst the
 Media presidential campaign hoopla his message was twisted into
 an incomprensible sound bite that was taken out of context.
 In other words, terrorism should not be fought using Cold War
 period tactics and a Cold War paradigm but the technology available
 today in the Net Age.

<p>Politics affects everything nomatter what denial some people
 indulge in. Therefore, I would love to hear what developers
 thing about this idea! 

<l>Hi, I just found your website through a blog and I can&#8217;t
 believe you are the creater of FireFox! So young and talented!
 If you are ever thinking about a vacation, come to Hawaii where
 I live. 

<l>Blake I love that cover - it closely matches the colors that
 I have chosen for my blog. I have to agree with general consensus
 on your age. Congrats on your sauces, and Firefox&#8217;s sauces
 for that matter&#8230;it&#8217;s all I&#8217;ll ever use - that&#8217;s
 for sure. 

<l>Some very interesting comments Mr. Ross. Perhaps less a commentary
 on the nature of technology, web browsing, or UberGeeking, and
 more of a statement of the current nature of personkind. 

<l>So much for NADA&#8230; another Bill Gates in the making!! Just
 wait 20 years, and we all shall PAY him instead. The only way
 Netscape lost the war, is because they charged too much, GREED!
 FAME! &#038; ADULATION! I particulary don&#8217;t like MS, but
 it is free and widely used all around, and it is a challenge
 to use, the spice of life. Good luck and break a leg! 

<l>I&#8217;ve been watching Mozilla for a long time. I work at a
 media company and had the pleasure of meeting members of the
 Mozilla Evangelist group. I have to say that in my years of
 developing web applications and software I never thought I would
 see a browser impact MicroSh1t as much as you have.

<l>I am a Firefox evangelist and I whole-heartedly preach it to
 all my friends, family and colleagues.

<l>As the iT coordinator of a high school specialty program outside
 of washington DC I am sooo glad to see and pass to my 550 iT
 students that there is hope agaisnt the giants like Microsoft.
 Your browser is super! You are fast becoming a national treasure.
 

<l>Congratulations to your efforts on Firefox. And you well deserve
 to be on the cover of &#8220;Wired&#8221;. I also appreciate
 the opinions expressed within your blog aticles. Remember they
 called Marc Andreessen the &#8220;next Bill Gates&#8221; ten
 years ago - I am sure you will not share his fate. 

<l>whats the big deal its only a netscape behide it nothing new,
 for those of you out their who thinks this is amuising, this
 code has been stolen and recomplied, only the GUI has changed
 and few plugins add&#8217;ed. thats all nothing much new, the
 microsoft internet broswer has settings which control how you
 surf shame you havnt figured it out yet. firefox only good for
 popups, 

<l>I agree with all those who say you are very good looking to the
 point of sexy. Been using Firefox on my PC and my Mac since
 0.9. A hot piece of software made by a hot person; that should
 become the norm. Instead of sex, how about dinner and a movie
 first? Is that ball on eBay?
