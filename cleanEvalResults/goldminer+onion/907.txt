<p>Speaking of kids, my son Patrick is learning the bass guitar
 amazingly fast. He's only had it a month and he's already starting
 to play riffs. It's amazing how fast kids can pick things up
 when they are motivated. He had a concert all arranged for me
 when I arrived. I was most impressed. I really am lucky to have
 him in my life. He's such a great kid and is always well mannered.
 I drag him to a lot of geek lunches and dinners and he's always
 well behaved even though he's bored out of his mind.

<p>We finally got his computer setup and finished today so I can
 use MSN Messenger with him (he has a video camera so I can watch
 him play his guitar over the Internet now).

<p>He's running around with Maryam's niece and nephew. It's always
 fun to watch them interact.

<p>I can't believe he's already 11. It seems like just yesterday
 when I was holding him like Lenn is holding his new son.

<p>Here's another blogger story I missed in the past week. Jeremy
 Wright got stopped at the US/Canada border because the guards
 there didn't believe that you could get a job as a blogger.
 Heh. I'll have to remember not to tell them that when I come
 back in the country.

<p>Anyway, some people are apparently giving Jeremy grief. That
 sucks. If you've ever been through the US/Canada border you
 know just how much a pain in the behind that experience can
 sometimes be. Usually it's smooth, but I've heard some horror
 stories. It seems they want to keep out people who are moving
 here for economic reasons. If you're moving here for economic
 reasons make sure you have all your papers and a good story
 to tell when coming through the border.

<p>And, Jeremy, as an American, I'm sorry for my countrymen's behavior.
 Welcome to America.

<p>Tony Chang, who works at Google, brags about Google's 20% time.
 This is an interesting thing about Google and it sure sounds
 like a tempting benefit. Employees there get to spend 20% of
 their time working on whatever they want to work on.

<p>He thinks the reason that other companies can't implement 20%
 time is because other companies don't have information sharing
 that Google has.

<p>That's hogwash, at least in Microsoft's case. You should see
 the kind of information sharing we have on our intranet here.
 I'd be happy to give you a tour Tony. You might be shocked at
 the internal information sharing that goes on here. And, yes,
 I do have access to a lot of killer stuff over at MSN Search
 even though I don't work on that team and, even if that info
 isn't up on the intranet, you can always email a list to find
 the PM on the team you want to work with and then email him
 or her. I've done that a lot.

<p>So, why doesn't Microsoft have 20% time? Well, speaking for myself,
 if Bill Gates told me I could have 20% time I'd say "that's
 nice Bill, but I'm already working on what I want to work on."
 Maybe I'm a rarity at Microsoft, but I don't think so. If any
 employee isn't happy where he or she is, there are lots of opportunities
 to move around.

<p>The thing is I need 20% time to do all the work I hate to do.
 Like expense reports or other corporate proceedures and processes.
 Now if someone could take those kinds of chores away then THAT
 would be an employee benefit I'd really like.

<p>One of the guys I really like at Microsoft, John Porcaro, reported
 that he suffered some serious burns a few weeks ago. He works
 in Xbox marketing. I totally missed this. Has pictures and stuff
 that are quite scary and painful looking.

<p>I just showed this to Maryam and she said "oh my God." John was
 at my birthday party back in January and we both really like
 him. He always has a positive attitude that is endearing.

<p>John, glad to see you're doing better and glad to see your sense
 of humor survives. Love the title of the post "burn baby burn."

<p>The first edition of "Sound Policy" with Denise Howell on IT
 Conversations is now up. This is an audio show. First one was
 arguing about linking technologies like Microsoft Smart Tags
 and Google's Autolink. Cory Doctorow, Marty Schwimmer, and I
 had a pretty intense debate. Hope you like it. Reminder that
 this was recorded on 3/9/2005, which was before I modified my
 beliefs about linking technologies a bit.

<p>Keep in mind that I did not take Microsoft's side in this one.
 I took the content producer's side (Cory hated that term, by
 the way).

<p>By the way, debating with Cory is a very intense experience.
 Listening to the conversation it's pretty clear he beat me in
 debating skills.

<p>I wish Dave Winer was on the conversation. It'd be fun to hear
 those two guys go at it.

<p>The New Year starts tomorrow morning. We're having a big party
 here in Santa Clara with lots of family and friends to celebrate.
 Lots of goodies and great food.

<p>By the way, the link above shows just how much the blogosphere
 has changed in only a year or two. Last year there were hardly
 any comments about the Iranian New Year. This year? I can't
 read them all.

<p>Dave Winer today tells a story about seeing someone floating
 by his beach house window who waved at Dave.

<p>I had a, um, geekier experience. I walked into Peet's coffee
 in Petaluma. There a really tall guy kept staring at me like
 he was trying to figure out who I was. I stared back. Eventually
 he said something like "I think I've met you before." Then it
 dawned on him: "you're a blogger." Heh. Yup. Guilty as charged.
 "You're the Scobleizer."

<p>Yeah. But now I was in the embarrassing place of having someone
 recognize me that I didn't recognize back.

<p>An honor meeting him. We had a nice chat about the projects he's
 worked on (Lucene, which was the engine in LookOut, a desktop
 search tool I used in Outlook before Microsoft bought it and
 rebuilt it for MSN Toolbar Suite), his new project, Nutch, which
 is an open source search project being done with Apache.

<p>We also chatted about the Apache license and various business
 models that can be used in the open source model. He wants Microsoft
 not to be afraid of the Apache license. His business model is
 a consulting one. He gives away the code, but charges companies
 (and he's worked for many of the big companies) a consulting
 fee to integrate his software into companies' other systems.

<p>Oh, Doug wasn't the only open source guy I met today. After leaving
 Petaluma (I was there to pick up my son) I had lunch with Joe
 Hewitt, one of the developers of Firefox. Shel Israel and I
 wanted to get the inside story of how Firefox got the large
 adoption it has gotten.

<p>Joe's a really great guy. Shel took notes and will post those
 over on the Red Couch later next week.

<p>It's great to get to talk to these two open source leaders. I
 have a feeling you and I will both be hearing more from them.

<p>Oh, you think they are working to bring down Microsoft, right?
 Well, both made the point that that isn't driving them at all
 and that both wondered if there were a way for Microsoft to
 work with the open source community in the future.

<p>That's an excellent question and one that I've been hearing a
 lot this week thanks to having the Linux and Java folks on campus.
 By the way, JavaLobby posted a report of the last day of the
 competitive influentials summit.

<p>One thing I came away from is that there's a lot that I need
 to learn from the larger community. These two guys opened my
 eyes to the open source world and hopefully these relationships
 will grow stronger. How should Microsoft work closer with the
 open source community?

<p>"They may provide fleeting satisfaction, but anything close to
 widespread adoption is going to create a big mess."

<p>Agreed. I still wish we wouldn't do a series of linking technologies
 (even though I don't see linking technologies as inherently
 evil anymore -- at least as long as they follow my rules for
 being user centric). There are so many ways to add links to
 a page to be helpful to users that don't require trying to mess
 with (or confuse users) over the links on the page. Now that
 most users have high resolution screens why not open a new pane
 up where you add "helpful links?" Why do you need to add the
 links onto the page itself?

<p>The neat thing about blogs is that if bosses don't really pull
 you into the corporation and give you transparency into their
 processes, thinking, or anything else, you can always unsubscribe
 from their RSS feed and ignore them.

<p>Obviously AJAX is pretty cool. Look at Google's Maps. Pretty
 damn cool.

<p>But, I just spent part of yesterday over talking with the Avalon
 team. AJAX is definitely cool for a whole raft of things, but
 it isn't the end all and be all. AJAX falls apart when your
 Internet connection goes down, for instance, and it also falls
 down when you really want the best user-interaction experience.

<p>You should talk with Billy Hollis. He has clients that switched
 from Web apps to Smart Clients and saved millions of dollars.

<p>Why? Well, it isn't hard to see how an app that runs locally
 would be able to make users more productive.

<p>But, comparing the two approaches just seems wacky to me. It'd
 be like comparing Onfolio to Bloglines. They both have their
 advantages, but at the end of the day I'd rather have Onfolio
 or NewsGator.

<p>Oh, wait a second, NewsGator is using both a SmartClient approach
 and a Web-based approach.
