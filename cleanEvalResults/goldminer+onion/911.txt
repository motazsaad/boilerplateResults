<p>Speaking Truth To Power

<p>I am often asked why, given my disillusionment with the Republican
 Party and the conservative movement in this country, I am still
 such a fan of John Hawkins and his blog Right Wing News.  The
 answer is simple:  he&#8217;s very, very good at stating his
 positions, and he&#8217;s not afraid to speak his mind.  I respect
 that to no end, even if I fundamentally disagree with him a
 lot of the time.  As an example of that, I give you this post,
 which is John guest blogging at Tom Delay&#8217;s website. 

<p>
How could it be that we had a Republican President, 55 Republican
 Senators, and a 15 seat lead in the House, yet we still had
 a massive deficit, a Republican led amnesty for illegal aliens
 push, and someone like Harriet Miers being nominated to the
 Supreme Court? Just when did the Republican Party become the
 sort of party that supported projects like the &#8220;Bridge
 to Nowhere,&#8221; and expensive big government programs like
 the Medicare Prescription drug plan? When did we stop being
 the party of Reagan and become the Party of compassionate conservatism?
 &#8220;Compassion&#8221; is all well and good, but in the real
 world, all it seems to mean is wasting a lot of taxpayer money
 and the President standing there and taking it when he&#8217;s
 called a liar who misled the American people into going to war
 by Democrats who voted for the war themselves because they believed
 that Saddam had an active WMD program. 

<p> Face it: the GOP lost in 2006 because they became complacent,
 arrogant, and decided that they were too good to, &#8220;dance
 with the conservatives that brung them,&#8221; into power in
 the first place. Moreover, let me add that the distance between
 the Republicans in Washington and the people who should be their
 biggest supporters has yet to be bridged by the sting of defeat.
 The base may not like the Democrats or be happy that they&#8217;re
 in power, but they&#8217;re still frustrated and angry with
 the GOP.

<p> Who makes more sense, John or the excuse-makers in the GOP?
  Read the whole thing. 

<p>NOTE:  If you&#8217;re coming here via a link from another blog
 full of righteous indignation, make sure you read this first.

<p> Maybe I&#8217;m wrong.  Maybe God does want a Republican majority
 in the Senate. 

<p>
MSNBC is currently reporting that Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD)
 has suffered a stroke. 

<p> There is no word, currently, on the Senator&#8217;s condition.
 

<p> A call from RAW STORY to Johnson&#8217;s office has not yet
 been returned. 

<p> If Johnson were to pass away, or be forced to retire, the US
 Constitution delegates the task of appointing a replacement
 to South Dakota lawmakers, who in turn, often turn that task
 over to the Governor. The Governor of that state, Mike Rounds,
 is a Republican, and both houses of the state legislature are
 dominated by Republicans. 

<p> In the case of South Dakota, the decision would fall to Rounds,
 whose appointment would serve as senator until 2008 at which
 point Johnson&#8217;s seat would have been up for election anyhow.

<p> While anyone suffering a stroke is a tragic event, how fucking
 hilarious would it be if the Democrats lost control of the Senate
 right before they were to assume power?  I&#8217;d laugh and
 laugh and laugh and laugh… 

<p>Update: His staff is now saying no stroke.  Stay tuned to see
 if this is really nothing or if the Democrat politburo is pulling
 a Fidel Castro. 

<p>There&#8217;s been (ahem) a few people lately who have essentially
 blamed me for the loss of Congress because I didn&#8217;t vote
 for the GOP.  Their argument is that no matter how bad the GOP
 is, the Democrats are worse.  In many respects this is true,
 but I&#8217;d like to illustrate this concept with an analogy.
 

<p> Say you need surgery and you have to choose between two doctors.
  Both of them are drunk.  One is more drunk than the other.
  Since a drunk doctor is in no shape to perform surgery, does
 it really make any difference which one you end up with?  Is
 it really that significant that one doctor is slightly less
 drunk than the other?  No matter which one you select, you&#8217;ll
 end up maimed or dead. 

<p> So, rather than choose the less of two evils, I punted.  I&#8217;m
 hoping that by a loss this time around it will cause the slightly
 less drunk doctor to go to rehab and get his act together. 
 In 2008, I&#8217;ll evaluate the two doctors once more.  And
 if they&#8217;re still both drunk, I&#8217;ll be once again
 visiting Dr. Libertarian. 

<p>You know the old saying &#8220;Don&#8217;t put your eggs in one
 basket?&#8221; Well, if you want to know why the GOP lost in
 November, it&#8217;s because they put all their eggs in the
 fundamentalist Christian basket. 

<p>
In our study, &#8220;The Libertarian Vote,&#8221; we analyzed
 16 years of polling data and found that libertarians constituted
 13 percent of the electorate in 2004. Because libertarians are
 better educated and more likely to vote, they were 15 percent
 of actual voters.

<p> That&#8217;s a pretty decent sized chunk of voters, enough to
 swing an election. 

<p>
Libertarian Party candidates may have cost Sens. Jim Talent
 and Conrad Burns their seats, tipping the Senate to Democratic
 control. In Montana, the Libertarian candidate got more than
 10,000 votes, or 3 percent, while Democrat Jon Tester edged
 Burns by fewer than 3,000 votes. In Missouri, Claire McCaskill
 defeated Talent by 41,000 votes, a bit less than the 47,000
 Libertarian votes.

<p> Ooooh, that&#8217;s gotta hurt!  But why were libertarians turned
 off from a party that they traditionally vote for? 

<p>
President Bush and the congressional Republicans left no libertarian
 button unpushed in the past six years: soaring spending, expansion
 of entitlements, federalization of education, cracking down
 on state medical marijuana initiatives, Sarbanes-Oxley, gay
 marriage bans, stem cell research restrictions, wiretapping,
 incarcerating U.S. citizens without a lawyer, unprecedented
 executive powers, and of course an unnecessary and apparently
 futile war. 

<p> Yep, pretty much.  They GOP isn&#8217;t conservative or small
 government any more, it&#8217;s Christian socialism and authoritarianism.
  And it&#8217;s not a party I have any interest in supporting.
  But here&#8217;s the kicker. 

<p>
The striking thing may be that after all that, Democrats still
 looked worse to a majority of libertarians.

<p> Absolutely true, which is why I voted Libertarian.  I couldn&#8217;t
 lower myself to voting for the Democrats, but there was absolutely
 no way I could in good conscience vote for the GOP.  Now, here&#8217;s
 the clincher, the elephant in the drawing room, the inescapable,
 undeniable truth of life that the Republican Party has clearly
 forgotten.  If you are a Republican who&#8217;s all butt hurt
 over the ass-whipping you just took, READ THIS PARAGRAPH OVER
 AND OVER AND OVER UNTIL IT SINKS IN. 

<p>
If Republicans can&#8217;t win New Hampshire and the Mountain
 West, they can&#8217;t win a national majority. And they can&#8217;t
 win those states without libertarian votes. They&#8217;re going
 to need to stop scaring libertarian, centrist, and independent
 voters with their social-conservative obsessions and become
 once again the party of fiscal responsibility. In a Newsweek
 poll just before the election, 47 percent of respondents said
 they trusted the Democrats more on &#8220;federal spending and
 the deficit,&#8221; compared to just 31 percent who trusted
 the Republicans. That&#8217;s not Ronald Reagan&#8217;s Republican
 Party.

<p>The Right of the Left

<p>I just got an email message from the head of the California GOP.
 

<p>
While Republican Governors and Senators were falling throughout
 the country in the worst year for Republicans since 1974, you
 played a vital role in insuring the re-election of Governor
 Schwarzenegger.  And although the media is rightfully pointing
 out the broad support the Governor received, exit polls show
 91% of Republicans voted for the Governor, an amazing number.
  You also were critical in the election of our newest star,
 Steve Poizner, as Insurance Commissioner. 

<p>
 Just four years ago pundits, both Democrat and Republicans,
 said it was almost impossible for a Republican to win a statewide
 race. Now, even columnists like George Skelton believe Tuesday’s
 results were not an anomaly and that quality Republicans can
 and will win statewide races in California.  That is a dramatic
 change. 

<p>
 At the legislative level, even with gerrymandered districts,
 we not only held the three assembly and one senate seat that
 were under attack by the Democrats; but you were the difference
 in the election of Lynn “Landslide” Daucher to a seat formerly
 held by the Democrats (by a 138 vote margin as of this writing).
  And finally, your clear call for “no new taxes” was heard
 throughout the state with defeat of all measures that sought
 to increase our taxes. 

<p> Wow.  Standard small-government conservatism with a libertarian
 social policy seemed to work, even in a liberal state like California.
  How&#8217;s that Christian socialism working out for the rest
 of you? 

<p>This morning Sullivan makes exactly the same point I did two
 days ago about Rush Limbagh and Hugh Hewitt, though he managed
 to be a lot more diplomatic and used far fewer &#8220;fucks&#8221;
 than I. 

<p>
The one thing you learn from this: Hewitt and Limbaugh are party
 animals. They put loyalty to party above intellectual honesty.
 They have admitted that they knowingly misled their readers
 and listeners. They can and will do it again.

<p> Of course they will, because their listeners want (need!) to
 feel that they&#8217;re a truth detector, a beacon of accuracy
 in a world warped by the evil grasp of the liberals.  As I asked
 their fans the other day, &#8220;Since both of them admitted
 today that they didn’t really believe the things they’ve
 been saying for the past few years, how can any of you possibly
 believe anything they tell you in the future?&#8221;

<p>The Perils of Reality

<p>Following up on a point I have made countless times in the past
 is Jake Tapper. 

<p>
There are legitimate conservative arguments to make about the
 media. But not every time someone reports something that doesn&#8217;t
 bode well for Republicans is it bias. Sometimes it&#8217;s called:
 reality.

<p> Exactly.  Just because you believe that the Democrats are the
 sum total of all evil doesn&#8217;t mean that the Republicans
 are any better.  Just because you happen to rightly point out
 that Rumsfeld is astonishingly unqualified for his job does
 not make you a liberal, and the fact that Cindy Sheehan and
 Michael Moore might hold the same opinion (but for totally different
 reasons) does not make you a liberal. 

<p> The Bush administration has done a lot of bad, bad things. 
 Pointing out this undeniable fact does not make you a liberal,
 it makes you a believer in objective reality.  Dismissing everything
 as a plot by them durn libriuls?  That makes you delusional.
 

<p>Update: Allow me to elaborate here.  The MSM all leans left,
 that&#8217;s indisputable.  However, &#8220;that durn librul
 media&#8221; has become such a convenient catchword.  NY Times
 reports good news about Bush?  Shout it to the world!  NY Times
 reports bad Bush news?  It&#8217;s media bias, because they
 hate America.  Polling data shows Bush in the lead?  Woo hoo,
 suck it liberals!  Polling data shows Bush in the toilet?  Well,
 those polls are biased by the liberal media. 

<p> The point of this post isn&#8217;t to claim there is no liberal
 media bias, of course there is.  I blog on it all the time.
  The point is that, for way too many people, bad news for Republicans
 instantly equals &#8220;liberal media.&#8221; As Tapper said,
 sometimes it&#8217;s not liberal, sometimes its accurate.  &#8220;Liberal
 media bias&#8221; has become all-too convenient an excuse for
 the right to blithely dismiss any reportage it doesn&#8217;t
 like, and that&#8217;s a serious problem. 

<p>I&#8217;m going to post on this because it&#8217;s been irking
 me all morning.  This was left in a comment earlier today. 

<p>
Whenever you find yourself standing shoulder to shoulder with
 the likes of Michael Moore and Cindy Sheehen on a particular
 issue, you might want to check your position.

<p> Let&#8217;s explore this for a moment.  What is the point behind
 making this statement?  Simple, it&#8217;s to discredit the
 other party.  If you can&#8217;t provide a logical basis for
 an argument, you can always win by trying to turn your opponent
 into sum durn librul.  Allow me to flip this around a little.
 

<p> Whenever you find yourself supporting a president with a long
 record of approval ratings in the toilet, you might want to
 check your position. 

<p> Whenever you find yourself supporting a party which just lost
 control of Congress in a fit of voter dissatisfaction, you might
 want to check your position. 

<p> Whenever you find yourself as a staunch backer of one of the
 most incompetent defense secretaries in the history of this
 country, you might want to check your position. 

<p> Whenever you find yourself as a gung-ho flag waver for an administration
 which is more concerned with the manner in which a war is fought
 rather than in actually winning it, you might want to check
 your position. 

<p> Whenever you find yourself defending the astonishing corruption
 of the Bush-era GOP, you might want to check your position.
 

<p> Get the point?  It&#8217;s not me that has anything to apologize
 for.  What remarks like the one above are intended to do is
 throw up some kind of evil boogeyman, against which all &#8220;normal&#8221;
 people will rebel.  It&#8217;s exactly the same logic that we&#8217;ve
 seen in this election cycle.  &#8220;If the Democrats win, then
 those gay homosexuals will be in the elementary schools converting
 your children to their sick lifestyle!&#8221; Rather than defend
 the policies of the Bush GOP (which is virtually impossible
 to do), they throw up a red herring like the impending homosexual
 invasion to muddy the waters.  It&#8217;s the politics of fear
 and intimidation, Karl Rove&#8217;s masterstroke, and it just
 didn&#8217;t work any more. 

<p> Disagree with my views?  Refute them all you like.  But remember
 this, it wasn&#8217;t my party or my ideology that just got
 kicked in the nuts yesterday.  

<p>I have to admit that I&#8217;m quite happy that Jim Webb won.
  Allen was a moron, and Webb is exactly the type of guy I wish
 we had more of in Congress.  Good for him. 

<p> A while back I wrote a post about gridlock, and how divided
 government is always something we should strive for.  In this
 post I asked whether you would prefer a Democrat president and
 a Republican Congress or vice versa.  If I had to pick one,
 it would be a Democrat president.  Now we&#8217;ve got the opposite.
  Let&#8217;s see how well this works, too. 

<p>I have another comment here which I think deserves a response
 on the main page. 

<p>
Andrew Sullivan would know about dick in his mouth. Lee you
 said “I haven’t spent the last four years with George W.
 Bush’s dick in my mouth, telling everyone how wonderful it
 tasted” well if my memory serves me, you voted for him 2 years
 ago. And I remember nothing but good talk about him from you.

<p> That&#8217;s partially true, but not entirely right.  Yes, two
 years ago I voted for Bush.  I wasn&#8217;t thrilled about it,
 but I thought that at the time he was, even with all his faults,
 the best man for the job.  If the election were held today,
 and I had to make the same choice between the two candidates,
 I&#8217;d probably choose Bush again for the same reasons I
 did before.  If I remember correctly, at the last minute I went
 back on one of my pledges, and donated $20 to the GOP, simply
 because I thought Kerry was singularly unfit to prosecute a
 war of any description, let alone a non-conventional war like
 this one.  So in that sense I was pro-Bush. 

<p> However, I was also anti-Bush at the time, but not as overtly
 so.  I was very critical of the president&#8217;s spending policies,
 and some other general stuff like that, but the Iraq War was
 still new enough to where it had not yet turned into a goatfuck,
 and this it was all-too easy for us to write off the bad news
 as nothing but reports by the durn librul media trying to sabotage
 the war.  Where I failed in this regard is that, yes, the media
 were trying to sabotage the war, but this didn&#8217;t make
 their reports any less accurate.  So when they reported on ,
 say, Abu Ghraib, I was all too willing to dismiss it as agitprop
 by the anti-war contingent of the American left. 

<p> Since his reelection in 2004 we&#8217;ve been treated to Teri
 Schiavo, then the hurricanes and the incompetent rescue, not
 to mention the aftermath.  Then the video of Bush surtfaced
 receiving his final briefing prior to the hurricanes making
 landfall, where he just sat without asking a single question.
  It was mindblowing seeing this transpire, and it really showed
 a level of monumental self-delusion.  This was really the beginning
 of the end with me.  When I started reading the resumes and
 pedigrees of some of the people Bush put into key cabinet posts
 I was just floored. 

<p> As things started going south in Iraq I got to thinking if the
 media stories we were hearing might, y&#8217;know, be true after
 all.  And they were.  We learned about the people sent to Iraq
 to fulfill jobs for which they had no experience of qualifications
 other than being campaign donors for the GOP, or interns at
 the national party apparatus.  So they&#8217;d send someone
 to Iraq, for example, to set up the Treasury or some other vitally
 important institution, and this guy would have zero experience
 at everything except raising GOP money.  I also read about how
 there was, literally, no counterinsurgency plan in place because
 the fundamentalists had convinced Bush/Rummy that they would
 ever become established. 

<p> In 2002 I was gungh-ho Bush. 
 In 2004 I was &#8220;Man, is
 this guy an asshole!  But, he&#8217;s better than Kerry.&#8221;
 
 In 2006 I am &#8220;This guy has lost touch with reality,
 and the only thing which can solve the problem is politically.&#8221;
 

<p> I wanted the GOP to lose and lose big because they absolutely
 deserved it.  If there was a way to do so without helping the
 enemy I would do so, but there isn&#8217;t, so I didn&#8217;t.
  The Bush/Cheney/Rummy cabal needed to be stopped, and they
 showed no inclination themselves towards self-restraint and
 self-policing. 

<p> At any rate, 2004 saw me as lukewarm at best when it came to
 Bush.  By 2006 I had learned so much new information I was just
 disgusted.  And I voted accordingly. 

<p>Update: I have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA why I named this post what
 I did.  I was really tired last night, and this was the last
 thing I did before I went to bed, so I guess in my mind this
 was some great witticism, but I&#8217;ll be damned if I can
 remember what it was.  Apologies.

<p>And I&#8217;m Sticking To It

<p>With Limbaugh and Hewitt now saying that they were just kidding
 about that whole supporting the GOP thing, is there anyone on
 the right who has the integrity to stick by their guns?  I give
 you John Hawkins. 

<p>
When Donald Rumsfeld became Secretary of Defense, he made an
 effort to change the military into a faster, sleeker force more
 capable of dealing with the sort of post Cold-War battles that
 we&#8217;re likely to fight today. Combine the sort of bureaucratic
 infighting that effort surely prompted with the fact that Rumsfeld
 is an extremely pushy, demanding sort of boss and it was inevitable
 that Rumsfeld would make a lot of enemies at the Pentagon. 

<p> Then, of course, there was the war. As the war in Iraq has grown
 steadily less popular, Rumsfeld made a whole new set of foes
 and the temptation to get rid of him for political reasons must
 have increased significantly over time for Bush. 

<p> Now, after a crushing defeat in the election, with old Republican
 allies like Richard Perle calling Rumsfeld incompetent, with
 the Military Times calling for Rumsfeld&#8217;s dismissal, and
 with even some Republicans in Congress calling for Rummy to
 go, the pressure on Bush to get rid of him must have been enormous.
 Add to that the fact that by getting rid of Rumsfeld, it makes
 it much easier for Bush to credibly say to the American people,
 &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re changing strategies in Iraq and we think
 that we&#8217;re going to make progress.&#8221; 

<p> Personally, I like Rumsfeld a lot, think he was good for the
 military, and think he did a better job in Iraq than he has
 gotten credit for. However, Bush has allowed himself to become
 so politically weakened, that he probably felt he had no choice
 but to toss Rumsfeld over the side. I&#8217;m not thrilled with
 that development, but I&#8217;m not going to criticize Bush
 for it either. He did what he felt like he had to do and Rumsfeld&#8217;s
 replacement, Robert Gates, seems like a competent enough fellow.
 

<p> The truth is that Donald Rumsfeld probably deserved better,
 but that could be said of a lot of people who end up out of
 jobs in Washington. It&#8217;s just the nature of the beast
 in politics.

<p> I think Rumsfeld was one of the most incompetent political appointees
 of my lifetime, and given the astonishing levels of incompetence
 in virtually every aspect of the Bush administration, that&#8217;s
 saying something.  However, I can absolutely respect John&#8217;s
 opinion here.  I&#8217;ve been a faithful reader of his blog
 for years, and while he and I definitely have our disagreements
 of opinion, I&#8217;ve always found him to be one of the most
 eloquent, honest, and passionate defenders of the Republican
 Party.  This post shows why.  In the face of yesterday&#8217;s
 humiliating (but well-deserved) defeat at the hands of the Democrats,
 it would be oh-so easy for him to do what Hewitt and Limbaugh
 have done and turn his back on his previous beliefs, but to
 his eternal credit he has not done so.  Good for him. 

<p>
Wow- if there was ever a time to take a break from the blogs
 I think this is it. 

<p> Lee-I think you’re a smart guy, seriously.  But you just sound
 like a fucking bitter piece of shit right now.  Christ you got
 what you wanted and the people who came here faithfully are
 getting called names and ridiculed. 

<p> You know, I thought I would be upset if the dems won.  Thought
 the fucking world was gonna end.  I’m willing to wait and
 see what happens before I slit my wrists, but I sure didn’t
 need to hear this crap tonight. 

<p> I wish you well.

<p> Hey, I&#8217;m sorry, but for all this shit I&#8217;ve taken
 over the past two years&#8212;going from 5,000 visitors a day
 to 1,500, being called a liberal and a leftist and a socialist
 and a Bush-hater, having my integrity smeared with snarky little
 jabs about how the left-wing California air has been rotting
 my brain, and so on&#8212;you&#8217;ll have to give me a little
 time to gloat.  For all the sucking up to Bush that the right-wing
 punditocracy has done, for them to turn around now and say,
 &#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t believe what I said,&#8221; I mean,
 give me a fucking break.  Hugh Hewitt and Limbaugh have done
 more than just about any two conservative commentators to defend
 EVERYTHING that Bush has done, and the first damn thing they
 both say was, &#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t actually mean it.&#8221;
 

<p> What horseshit.  They both absolutely meant it.  Rather than
 face the ire of the Bushbots™ and the fundamentalists they
 chose the easy way out, whereas it was people like me who stuck
 true to our principles and have been drug through the mud for
 at least two years.  So am I bitter?  Am I frustrated?  You
 bet your ass I am.  It wasn&#8217;t my brain which was rotted,
 it was the people who have spent years explaining away every
 incompetent thing this administration has done because, after
 all, Jesus spoke to Bush, and nothing Jesus ever says could
 be wrong, could it? 

<p> Bush is hobbled.  Rummy is gone.  And I couldn&#8217;t be happier
 about either.  Now that the Democrats are back in power, I look
 forward to slamming them for EXACTLY THE SAME REASONS I&#8217;ve
 been slamming our utterly incompetent president and his astonishingly
 corrupt Congress. 

<p>Update: A question for those of you who like Limbaugh and Hewitt.
  Since both of them admitted today that they didn&#8217;t really
 believe the things they&#8217;ve been saying for the past few
 years, how can any of you possibly believe anything they tell
 you in the future? 

<p>Following up on Limbaugh&#8217;s &#8220;liberation&#8221; from
 this morning comes this whopper from Hugh &#8220;Shit Sandwich&#8221;
 Hewitt. 

<p>
And it is a wonderful day for new media, especially talk radio.
  For two years we have had to defend the Congressional gang
 that couldn&#8217;t shoot straight.  Now we get to play offense.
 

<p> Oh, spare me your bloviating, Hugh.  You haven&#8217;t &#8220;had&#8221;
 to defend anyone.  You defended them because you&#8217;re an
 evangelical, you&#8217;re partisan, and you&#8217;re a Republican.
  What you are NOT is a conservative.  You&#8217;re an authoritarian
 Christian statist, and you defended this party with your every
 breath because you were a true believer, a real eater of the
 Bush shit sandwich. 

<p> You know who doesn&#8217;t have anything to apologize for? 
 Me, and all the other real patriotic conservatives like me.
  We&#8217;ve recognized for years the utter damage that Bush
 has been doing to the country.  We gave him every possible benefit
 of every doubt, and kept waiting for him to actually LEAD, which
 he of course never did.  He never really had to, because there
 were sycophants like you and Limbaugh to constantly excuse his
 every failure, to explain how Iraq was going perfectly, to elaborate
 on how everything was the fault of that durn librul media. 
 If Bush had won yesterday, both you and Limbaugh (and Medved
 and Hannity and O&#8217;Reilly and all the other schmucks) would
 be crowing about what a resounding victory it was for one of
 America&#8217;s greatest presidents ever. 

<p> Well, enjoy that shit sandwich, Hugh.  Unlike you, I don&#8217;t
 have any fucking aftertaste in my mouth. 

<p>
Now, I mentioned to you at the conclusion of the previous hour
 that people having been asking me how I feel all night long.
 I got, &#8220;Boy, Rush, I wouldn&#8217;t want to be you tomorrow!
 Boy, I wouldn&#8217;t want to have to do your show! Oh-ho. I&#8217;m
 so glad I&#8217;m not you.&#8221; Well, folks, I love being
 me. (I can&#8217;t be anybody else, so I&#8217;m stuck with
 it.) The way I feel is this: I feel liberated, and I&#8217;m
 going to tell you as plainly as I can why. I no longer am going
 to have to carry the water for people who I don&#8217;t think
 deserve having their water carried. Now, you might say, &#8220;Well,
 why have you been doing it?&#8221; Because the stakes are high!
 Even though the Republican Party let us down, to me they represent
 a far better future for my beliefs and therefore the country&#8217;s
 than the Democrat Party and liberalism does. 

<p> You know what?  There are some of us out there who, unlike Limbaugh,
 are actual conservatives.  You know, people like me and Bill
 Quick and Andrew Sullivan and George Will and all the other
 folks who were more interested in telling the emperor he had
 no clothes than we were playing suck-boy to the GOP.  Unlike
 Limbaugh, I don&#8217;t feel liberated.  I feel vindicated.
  I haven&#8217;t spent the last four years with George W. Bush&#8217;s
 dick in my mouth, telling everyone how wonderful it tasted.
  I&#8217;ve stuck to my guns on every belief I&#8217;ve ever
 had, regardless of party affiliation.  And I have absolutely
 NOTHING to apologize for. 

<p> So all you Limbaugh fans out there, how does it feel to see
 just what a pathetic fucking sell-out your drug-addled hero
 is?

 if you've ever considered moving back. If you're in computers,
 the market is hot in the 4 major metro areas, and it's sure

 restoring the Ottoman Empire. They may have been brutal, but
 at least the camel; trains ran on time.

 for not being Baptist! I know, some New Yorkers told me.

 The Kurds are the most pro-American people in Iraq and deserve
 their own state. I wouldn't want to lose that if Turkey invades
 and we can't or won't stop them. Another legacy of Bush Jr's.
 shortsightedness.
