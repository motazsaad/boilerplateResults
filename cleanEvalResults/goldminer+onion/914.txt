<p>I finally got out of the house to have a pseudo-girl&#8217;s
 night.
 I was invited to a birthday/going away party for a friend
 of mine who is transferring to DC soon. It was also his 40th
 birthday. The party was set to start at 7pm. I, of course, was
 running a little later than I wanted to. But hey, it&#8217;s
 &#8220;fashionably late&#8221;, right. No problem. When I got
 there, the birthday boy wasn&#8217;t even there yet. Neither
 was anyone else. Jess and Crystal were the party-throwers, and
 they were there.
 So, we decided that if no one else showed
 up by 8:30, we were going out to party for a while. My hubby
 was watching the girls, so I was free for the night.
 We called
 the birthday boy on his cell phone at about 8pm and he said
 he was on his way from Auburn, so we thought &#8220;okay, he&#8217;ll
 be here in about 40&#8243;.
 Well, he didn&#8217;t get there
 in 40. He got there about 4 hours later. Yes, it was around
 midnight when he showed up. But others showed up before that.
 So, we stayed there and had a few drinks, ate some cake and
 snacked on some yummy munchies while we waited for the birthday
 boy to show up.
 Girl talk ensued. Much girl talk.
 Then, after
 the birthday boy showed up and we properly welcomed him by badgering
 him about being profusely late, we decided to head out to town.

 We had about 12 or 13 people all together and we were supposed
 to all be going to the same place, but we took 2 different cars.
 You know how it is. Three of us (myself, Jess and Crystal) all
 went in one vehicle and the others went in a couple other vehicles.

 We promised we would meet up at the same bar in about 5 minutes.
 Um, yeah, that didn&#8217;t happen. Our little threesome stayed
 at the bar we started at for about an hour or two.
 We were
 having a great time just sitting there, being treated to a free
 beverage courtesy of a nice (older) gentleman sitting at the
 bar, who noticed us walk in.
 All of a sudden, Jess is having
 a heated conversation with someone sitting on the other side
 of her. Crystal and I were wondering what the heck was going
 on. This 50-something lady (and I use that term loosely) was
 giving Jess a hard time. Aparently, that was HER seat Jess was
 sitting in. And of course Crystal and I were wondering how this
 seat was hers if she wasn&#8217;t sitting in it, and we were
 in a crowded bar (which seemed to be at full capacity at that
 time). Her purse was sitting in front of the chair next to the
 one Jess sat down in, but not in front of the seat Jess sat
 in. So, the teenie-bopper wannabe gramma decided to raise a
 huff with the bartender about it. The bartender proceeded to
 tell us that the older woman had in-fact been sitting there
 all night. Well, woopedee doo. She wasn&#8217;t sitting there
 when we walked in. She was dancing, or whatever you call what
 she was doing on the dance floor. Needless to say, we caused
 a commotion in the place and everyone at the bar was watching
 us closely at this point. Just waiting to see a fist fight or
 see us getting tossed out on our tooshies.
 So, we decided to
 take the high road and move over to another side of the pub.
 We got another drink and tried to let that situation pass. While
 Jess was getting cornered by some guy who had been eyeing her
 all night, Crystal and I went to talk to some of her acquaintances.
 In between potty breaks, we kept running into people Crystal
 knows. I really don&#8217;t get out much. That much is obvious.

 Just one thing bothered me, getting pinched on the cheek and
 being told I&#8217;m &#8220;cute&#8221;.
 Good God, what am
 I? 13? I don&#8217;t want to be told I&#8217;m cute. I&#8217;m
 not available anyway, so I quickly flashed my diamond at him
 and he got the picture. I guess it&#8217;s nice to get hit on
 every once in a while. It makes ya feel like someone else thinks
 you&#8217;re attractive besides your significant other.
 We
 left the bar and started heading to the place where we were
 supposed to meet everyone else, and that&#8217;s where my night
 ended. I drove the girls to the other bar, and drove Crystal&#8217;s
 SUV back to Jess&#8217;s house, picked up my car and headed
 home.
 That was my Saturday night. Full of fun, surprises, excitement.
 I had a blast. 

<l>The 4 hours late was because his sister threw him a party and
 he didn&#8217;t know about it. Of course, we told him he could
 have called us to let us know he would be really late, but we
 forgave him anyway. We&#8217;re too nice!

<l>It was quite a much needed night out with the girls. It was a
 heckofa good time.
