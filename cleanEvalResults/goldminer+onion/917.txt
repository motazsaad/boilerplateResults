<p>Josh Marshall (who is dealing with his post-dissertation downtime
 better than I, apparently) responds to Andrew Sullivan. He concludes
 with this:

<p>
Among old lefties, there always used to be this line that you
 couldn&#8217;t say socialism or communism had failed because
 it had never really been tried. I told a friend a few days ago,
 that for better or worse, after this is done, we&#8217;re not
 going to be able to say the same thing about neo-conservatism.
 This is their show. If it all pans out great, they&#8217;ll
 really be able to crow. If it doesn&#8217;t, there will be nowhere
 to run.

<p>And just yesterday, the Times and the Post were full of stories
 about rifts becoming public between Rumsfeld and the Pentagon
 and the Republican Party and the administration (I can&#8217;t
 find any of them now). Perhaps there will be another round of
 resignations before too long.

<p>In the meantime, when this is all over, we&#8217;ll occupy the
 two countries on either side of Iran.

<h>Thursday, March 27th, 2003

<p>When I first began teaching here, I was told by a number of people
 &#8220;You&#8217;re a student first, and a teacher second. Don&#8217;t
 let your teaching interfere with your own work.&#8221; In some
 ways, this is good advice for the graduate student teacher.
 But I never bought it.

<p>My students, I always reasoned, were paying for my expertise.
 They had the right to expect the best instruction I could give
 them, and I have an ethical obligation&#8211;because there are
 classrooms full of them depending upon me&#8211;to put their
 needs before my own. My own work, I reasoned, would have to
 be placed second. To do anything other than this would risk
 engaging in a kind of theft.

<p>Until this semester, this is the way I&#8217;ve gone about the
 business of teaching. I stay up late prepping for my classes.
 I read and re-read their assignments so I can speak authoritatively
 about the texts. I work hard to come up with innovative and
 insightful ways to impart to them the knowledge they need to
 do well in their academic lives. And believe me, no teacher
 worth his salt wants a student to do poorly on an essay, if
 only because bad and even average essays take a long time to
 grade and comment on, while good essays take no time at all.
 I comment voluminously on their writing assignments, and I explain
 to them that it does them no good for me simply to write &#8220;Good.
 B+&#8221; on their work and not give them any sense of why they
 earned the grade they did or what they might do better in the
 future. I work hard to make myself available to them whenever
 they need me. They can email me. They can call me at home. I
 tell them, time and time again, that I will meet with them whenever
 they need me. I&#8217;ve met students on Saturdays off-campus.
 I&#8217;ve met students at0 pm

<p>I saw this story on google news about Michael Moore&#8217;s tirade
 at the Oscars. &#8220;Tirade.&#8221; Not &#8220;tyrant.&#8221;
 And that&#8217;s just the headline. [edit: they&#8217;ve apparently
 noticed the vocabulary error and have made the change]

<p>At any rate, it wasn&#8217;t really a tirade. Those are supposed
 to be long.

<p>Nonetheless, I&#8217;m sick to death of hearing about it, and
 this particular piece is typical. Here&#8217;s the first salient
 bit:

<p>First, we defend Moore&#8217;s right to his opinion. That is,
 after all, what American soldiers have fought and died for the
 past 227 years. Moore may not appreciate that fact, but his
 freedom of speech so shrilly exhibited Sunday night came at
 a cost in lives and sacrifice by his fellow Americans. 

<p>Notice that it&#8217;s not his right to freedom of speech. It&#8217;s
 his right to have an opinion. There is, we should remind this
 editorial board, a significant difference between the two. One
 does no one but the individual any good. The other brings down
 tyrants. At any rate, that&#8217;s really not what &#8220;American
 soldiers have fought and died for the last 227 years&#8221;
 (ugh&#8230;this sentence actually needs to say &#8220;fought
 and died for for&#8221; in order to make any grammatical sense).
 They fought for his freedom to express his opinion without fear
 of retribution or silencing by the dominant political body.

<p>Note the implication that Moore&#8217;s expression of dissent
 (the core American value&#8211;if we are supposed to be about
 anything, it is that we recognize the value of dissent), marks
 him as an unpatriotic ass who fails to &#8220;appreciate&#8221;
 the deaths of all those soldiers. And thus not only is he an
 unpatriotic ass, he is an unfeeling one, as well.

<p>And then, wait for it, that brand new code word to describe dissent
 from the left: Moore was &#8220;shrill.&#8221; It&#8217;s a
 brilliant strategy. Any time a leftie goes on the offensive,
 he/she gets labeled as shrill (with all its connotations of
 mindless, high-pitched and terrified screaming), and any response
 afterwards is treated similarly.

<p>For some reason, though, someone on the editorial board of this
 &#8220;newspaper&#8221; failed to note that the turn in the
 logic of this little quote suggests that Moore&#8217;s freedom
 of speech came at so high a price&#8211;227 years of American
 soldiers&#8217; deaths&#8211;that it is simply too precious
 to use.

<p>Then we get this bit, which is the second part of seemingly every
 attack on Moore:

<p>What was tasteless about his comments is the timing. They came
 just hours after the shocking video was released on Iraqi TV
 of American POWs who appeared to have been beaten and some even
 executed by their Iraqi captors. Millions of Americans on Sunday
 afternoon had either seen the shocking footage or heard about
 it. By Sunday night, the last thing Americans needed to hear
 was a cry-baby tirade by some self-appointed &#8220;Blue-collar
 Everyman&#8221; who can&#8217;t seem to get over the 2000 presidential
 election. Shame on President Bush? Shame on you, Mr. Moore,
 shame on you.

<p>Yes, Michael Moore, the editorialist tells us, your freedom of
 speech is the most precious thing about being an American. But
 we&#8217;d really appreciate it if you wouldn&#8217;t use it
 just now. Maybe if you could wait until the crisis is over to
 say something. Or maybe if you could wait until you don&#8217;t
 have an immense pulpit from which to have your message heard.
 Or maybe if you could exercise your freedom of speech over there.
 It&#8217;s inconvenient, you see.

<p>***

<p>And while I&#8217;m at it, shame on you Natalie Maines of the
 Dixie Chicks, for apologizing. How dare you allow yourself to
 be cowed into apologizing for what you think. 

<p>***

<p>Sorry for the silence. I have students who need me right now,
 and I&#8217;m feeling guilty about having neglected them somewhat
 this semester so I could focus on finishing the dissertation.
