<h>Diary of a Start-Up: Getting By

<p>Today I accepted a 2-day job with a local automotive parts business.
 Supposedly I'll be spending my day filing, but what I've found
 with temp jobs is that you never know what you're going to be
 doing. For example, my first temp job ever I was told I'd be
 sorting t-shirts for a marketing campaign. Turns out, I was
 working in a warehouse for 8 hours lifting 60-pound boxes...in
 business casual attire.

<p>One of the reasons Dan and I decided to open our own business
 was because the concept of not working for someone else, or
 for something we didn't enjoy, seemed so ideal. What we didn't
 really consider was that not working at all is pretty scary.

<p>When we moved from St. Louis to Springfield, MO to pursue our
 dreams, that meant quitting our well paid, 401K-earning, exceptional
 health insurance-provided jobs. Though we were both stuck in
 cubicles, our jobs offered stability and a very comfortable
 life. Now that we are concentrating all of our efforts on opening
 the theater, stability and comfort is a thing of the past.

<p>To help make ends meet, we had an agreement that I would work
 as a temp while Dan worked on everything related to the theater.
 When I am in between jobs, then I could help out with whatever
 task needed to be done.

<p>At the beginning this worked out well. My first big assignment
 was for six weeks, and even though I dreaded the actual job
 (I was a collection agent for a local hospital), the weekly
 paycheck was nice. In the eight months we've been working on
 opening the theater, I've had about 10 different positions,
 including substitute teaching and freelancing for my former
 employer in St. Louis. 

<p>The problem now is that we are in the stages where we both need
 to be working full time on the theater, but we also need to
 pay bills, eat, and feed our dog. Luckily, the temp agency I
 work for knows my situation, and when they have short-term jobs
 come in, I'm the first on their list to call. That works out
 well, but unfortunately, those one-day jobs usually pay the
 least, and are few and far in between.

<p>By accepting this job for tomorrow, I've had to cancel two appointments
 and scramble tonight to get my administrative tasks done. Even
 then, most of those tasks will have to be postponed because
 they require making phone calls during business hours. I also
 feel guilty because accepting a temp job means a fairly easy
 day (unless, of course, it's substitute teaching), but Dan will
 be spending his time bolting theater chairs to the terrazzo
 floor of our auditorium.

<p>I guess it's the price we pay to follow our dreams, though!

<p>Diary of a Start-Up is a weekly blog written by Dan and Nicole
 Chilton, who are currently starting up an art-house theater
 in Springfield, Missouri. Dan has been chronicling their progress
 for more than a year at The Moxie Blog.

<p>I know what you mean about splitting your work up between something
 that pays and something that will hopefully pay off. My wife
 and I have been working together in our business for 3 years
 now. At first she worked part time and I worked full time until
 we had so much working coming that she had to go full time with
 me. 

<p>Now however, we are back to the issue of whether one of us should
 work full time and the other at a better paying job. I have
 to admit, it is very scary not knowing where or when your next
 pay check will come from. I am at least glad to see that there
 are others out there in the same boat with me and are succeeding
 at doing what we have considered doing.

<p>It was interesting to read of your experience. I too am quickly
 approaching a flashpoint that, after 20+ years of local government
 service, will result in my undertaking a totally new and wholly
 entrepreneural venture. Yes, it's exciting and yes, it's scary.
 But as I have remarked to my partner, I'm really excited over
 the prospect of having something to be really excited about.
 

<p>It's even harder when you are alone. I am single which means
 that I can not work two jobs since I am in the catalog business.
 I have to be by the phone all the time. I sideline on another
 business I have, but try to be in business and single at the
 same time. It can become a real chalenge real fast.

<p>SO nice to hear of others in the same boat! I'm pursung building
 my business (dealing in sacred art) completely on my own and
 it took me leaving my former high-paying job as a gallery director
 to do this--so I wasn't "competing" in any way, to give it my
 full attention. And now my days are filled with more and more
 things to do, from morning until night...and all the while I
 wonder, "Where's my paycheck"!!! What I'm learning is that this
 really is about investing in my future, in MYSELF. And THAT
 takes hard work--to really believe you can do it and that you
 have it in you to succeed. But what other option is there? It's
 now or never! So GOOD LUCK!!

<p>You do what you have to do. In my experience, the business owners
 who are willing to do whatever it takes are the ones that are
 most likely to succeed. Money is tight for everybody these days,
 and starting a business can be expensive as hell. Too many business
 owners have an expectation that once they come up with the idea,
 that the money will come rolling in. It just isn't true. We're
 doing well (3 years of retail), but I'm certainly not able to
 relax yet. Those who "expect" to be able to pay people say,
 do their painting or expect to be able to get paid $x from their
 business simply don't have realistic expectations, and as such,
 are more likely to fail. Good job, and keep it up! There's really
 nothing better than passing out after a very long, hard day
 of work.

<p>Congrats on doing your own business! I, too, have my own business
 and it is very scary sometimes. July was particularly scary,
 but things are finally starting to come around. I really think
 that everything just takes time. I really get a lot out of helping
 other business owners. We belong to a network of business owners,
 and we keep each other on track. I try to make contact with
 a few of them everyday.

<p>Lets face it - this IS the reality. Ignore the daily onslaught
 of mouth watering stories heralding instant business success
 and millions in the pocket (my biggest challenge these days).
 The success of any venture comes from the passion and persistence
 of the founders. I applaud us all on our commitment to becoming
 employers instead of employees. 

<p>Stick with it - you will make it!

<p>I took the plunge seven months ago...after 15 yrs. of corporate
 life and opened my own business. My wife was nervous at first
 and several of my friend expressed concern. After a ramp up
 period, I'm making more now than I had before and have A LOT
 more control over my earnings, career, & Time. Others have told
 me and its true, the best thing you can do is find time (even
 2 minutes per day)network with other business owners. If your
 committed and provide exceptional product or service, you will
 succeed!.

<p>I've enjoyed reading everyone's comments - it's fun to hear about
 how other people handle similar situations. Thanks for the positive
 reinforcement!
