<p>"Bugs" in the 24 March 1999 Version of the Web Content Accessibility
 Guidelines This memo highlights key "bugs" in the 24 March 1999
 version of the "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines." Additional
 bugs and suggestions are described in my revision of the 24
 March 1999 guidelines document. The revision is available (temporarily)
 at: http://etsr.digitalchainsaw.com/wcagpub/r990324a.htm =====
 Bug-1. The concept of "equivalent" is incomplete. Importance:
 Extreme Description: The overall concept of "equivalent" is
 probably the most important concept of the document. Yet I believe
 that without the change, the concept of "equivalent" will remain
 vague. Action Performed: Refined definition of "equivalent".
 See: http://etsr.digitalchainsaw.com/wcagpub/r990324a.htm#equivalent-def
 Further Action Suggested: Replace old language with new. Ease
 of Correction: Very easy === Bug-2. The definition of "equivalent"
 is incomplete without a concept of "communication element".
 Importance: Extreme Description: I think that the concept of
 "communication element" is very important. It has to encompass
 all the things listed in checkpoint 1.1. The term communication
 element is an essential foundation for the definition of equivalent.
 The term makes clear that we are not talking about "HTML elements."
 Action Performed: Added a new term called the "communication
 element". See the definition of "communication element": http://etsr.digitalchainsaw.com/wcagpub/r990324a.htm#communication-element-d
 ef I also replaced the phrase "non-text elements" with "non-text
 communication elements". I think that this change is extremely
 important. I did this because (1) The former was and is undefined
 and the latter is now defined.; (2) Several of the things that
 were called non-text elements looked like "text" (scripts, ASCII
 art, etc.) so the simple reference to "non-text elements" was
 confusing. Further Action Suggested: Add the provided definition
 to the glossary. Make a few related changes noted in main revision.
 Ease of Correction: Very easy == Bug-3. The term "text equivalent"
 is vaguely defined. Importance: Extreme Description: This is
 probably the most important refinement of the revision. The
 characteristic of being able to be rendered in several different
 ways - auditorially (synthesized speech), tactually (braille),
 and visually (visually-displayed text) -- was mentioned in the
 previous 3/24/99 version (in the body of the document but not
 the definition of text equivalent). But this revision makes
 the feature the one that distinguishes it from non-text equivalents.
 (A parallel contrast is found in the new distinction between
 "text communication elements" and "non-text communication elements.")
 If this cannot be addressed editorially, then I ask that it
 be discussed on the list or wherever else necessary. Action
 Performed: Refined the definition of "text equivalent". See
 the definition of text equivalent: http://etsr.digitalchainsaw.com/wcagpub/r990324a.htm#text-equivalent-def
 Further Action Suggested: Replace old language with new in the
 glossary and make a few other changes as indicated in the revision.
 Ease of Correction: Very easy == Bug-4. The term "non-text equivalent"
 is improperly defined. Importance: Extreme Description: This
 is another very important refinement. Essentially, a non-text
 equivalent is an "equivalent" that it is not a "text equivalent."
 The previous definition of non-text equivalent did not provide
 such a clear distinction. If this cannot be addressed editorially,
 then I ask that it be discussed on the list or wherever else
 necessary. Action Performed: Revised the definition of "non-text
 equivalent". See: http://etsr.digitalchainsaw.com/wcagpub/r990324a.htm#non-text-equivalent-def
 Further Action Suggested: Replace old language with new in the
 glossary and make a few other changes as indicated in the revision.
 Ease of Correction: Very easy == Bug-5. The term "alternative
 equivalent" is redundant. Importance: High Description: I eliminated
 the term "alternative" from the term "alternative equivalent"
 since the latter phrase is redundant. "Equivalent" is adequate
 by itself. Also, the term is "alternative" is not defined, except
 by context. (The word "alternative" seems fine in other usage.)
 Action Performed: Removed the "alternative" from the term "alternative
 equivalent" Further Action Suggested: Make edits as provided.
 Ease of Correction: Very easy == Bug-6. Document uses of the
 word "description" without making clear its special meaning.
 Importance: High Description: The revision reduced reliance
 on undefined terms such a "video description", "auditory description";
 these terms will tend to confuse people, especially if they
 are not defined in the glossary. They are not, to my knowledge,
 necessary. I tried the use defined terms and to get the same
 message across. For example, I found that the defined terms
 "equivalent" was often helpful. Action Performed: Reduced reliance
 on undefined uses of the word "description" Further Action Suggested:
 Make edits as provided. Ease of Correction: Very easy == Bug-7.
 The introduction to guideline 1 is inconsistent with the refined
 definitions. Importance: High Description: NA Action Performed:
 Provided a revised introductory section for guideline 1 to make
 it consistent with the revised definitions above. See: http://etsr.digitalchainsaw.com/wcagpub/r990324a.htm#revised-guideline-1-int
 ro Further Action Suggested: Use the provided language. Ease
 of Correction: Very easy == Bug-8. Checkpoint 1.1 needs refinement.
 Importance: Extreme Description: Note that is recently underwent
 a revision and therefore might be expected to require some editing.
 As noted, the reference to "synthesized speech" as requiring
 a "text equivalent" would not be comprehensible without further
 explanation. Action Performed: Revised the wording of checkpoint
 1.1 Here is my current suggestion: http://etsr.digitalchainsaw.com/wcagpub/r990324a.htm#suggested-revision-chec
 kpoint-1.1 Here are some earlier versions. They have some comments
 not in the most recent version. http://etsr.digitalchainsaw.com/wcagpub/r990324a.htm#revision-2-checkpoint-1
 .1 http://etsr.digitalchainsaw.com/wcagpub/r990324a.htm#revision-1-checkpoint-1
 .1 Here is an even older version with heavy comments: http://etsr.digitalchainsaw.com/wcagpub/r990324a.htm#commented-checkpoint-1.
 1 Here is the original (3/24/99) version: http://etsr.digitalchainsaw.com/wcagpub/r990324a.htm#old-3-24-99-checkpoint-
 1.1 Further Action Suggested: Make the provided changes. Note
 that any reference to "synthesized speech" as a non-text communication
 element would need to be explained if the group feels that it
 is important to include. Ease of Correction: Moderately easy.
 Should be reviewed by several members of the working group.
 There are a few questions raised that should be addressed. ==
 Bug-9. Checkpoint 14.2 mistakenly makes reference to equivalents
 "to text". Importance: Extreme Description: This is a clear
 factual error. Action Performed: Provided revised wording. (I
 also made other edits that should be considered.) See: http://etsr.digitalchainsaw.com/wcagpub/r990324a.htm#equiv-to-text-bug
 Further Action Suggested: Make the provided changes. Ease of
 Correction: Very easy. == Bug-10. The possibility of synchronizing
 text equivalents for video was not acknowledged in checkpoint
 1.3 Importance: Very High Description: The old version of 1.3
 reads: "For each movie, provide an auditory description of the
 video track and synchronize it with the audio track. [Priority
 1]" Action Performed: Revised checkpoint 1.3 and gave it a split
 priority. http://etsr.digitalchainsaw.com/wcagpub/r990324a.htm#checkpoint-1.3
 Further Action Suggested: Easy. This one should be reviewed
 and discussed. The idea proposed was discussed briefly but received
 inadequate consideration. Ease of Correction: Easy. == Bug-11.
 The word "visual" is used to describe non-text elements, even
 though text is usually rendered in a visual manner. Importance:
 Moderate Description: NA Action Performed: Reduced reliance
 on the word "visual". Generally, I have tried to reduce reliance
 on the word "visual" when referring to things like graphics
 and video. The problem is that it is sometimes intended as a
 contrast to text, yet text can also be "visual." If the editors
 think that it is important to use the visual, I recommend that
 they define it early in the body of the document. Further Action
 Suggested: Make provided changes. Ease of Correction: Easy ==
 Bug-12. The need for text equivalents for ASCII art was cited
 in two checkpoints (1.1 and 1.5). Importance: High Description:
 This is a small redundancy in the checkpoints. Action Performed:
 Deleted Checkpoint 1.5 http://etsr.digitalchainsaw.com/wcagpub/r990324a.htm#checkpoint-1.5
 Further Action Suggested: Make suggested deletion. Ease of Correction:
 Very Easy == Bug-13. The description of the relationship between
 the terms "assistive technology", "screen reader", and "user
 agent" is not consistent throughout the document. Importance:
 High Description: This is a fairly clear factual mismatch. See:
 http://etsr.digitalchainsaw.com/wcagpub/r990324a.htm#assistive-technology
 Action Performed: I have not tried to resolve this. Further
 Action Suggested: The editors should pick one explanation and
 use it throughout the document. Ease of Correction: Easy. ==
 Bug-14. The guidelines document does not claim a conformance
 level. Importance: High Description: The guidelines document
 does not claim a conformance level for itself. Action Performed:
 Added a conformance claim. See: http://etsr.digitalchainsaw.com/wcagpub/r990324a.htm#conf-claim-for-wcag-doc
 Further Action Suggested: Review and approve language. Ease
 of Correction: Fairly easy. This should be reviewed by Working
 Group members. == Bug-15. The document fails to follow checkpoint
 4.2 on acronyms and abbreviations. Importance: High (essential
 for obtaining triple-A rating). Description: NA Action Performed:
 Problem noted. One or more acronyms were expanded in the body
 of the text. Also another example was suggested. See: http://etsr.digitalchainsaw.com/wcagpub/r990324a.htm#abbreviations-and-acron
 yms Further Action Suggested: Fix them. I think that it would
 be an important lost opportunity to fail to claim a triple-A
 rating and do whatever it takes to make sure that it sticks.
 Ease of Correction: Fairly easy to somewhat difficult == Bug-16.
 The document does not say how to handle conformance ratings
 for inaccessible primary pages that have accessible alternative
 pages. Importance: Moderate to High Description: NA Action Performed:
 Provided an explanation. See: http://etsr.digitalchainsaw.com/wcagpub/r990324a.htm#alt-page-conformance
 Further Action Suggested: Verify that this is the desired location
 for this information. Approve. Ease of Correction: Easy =============================
