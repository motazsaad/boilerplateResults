<p>THE REPUBLICPolicies for Political, Electoral &amp; Constitutional
 ReformIssued 5th April, 2000, Adopted by the National Council,
 January 2000

<p>[*Note: The first section of Part B, Clause 2b,C is still in
 Official Draft mode, and is subject to further discussion at
 the June 2000 Conference]

<h>Preamble:

<p>a/ The PLP proceeds from the premise that major political, electoral
 and constitutional reforms are long overdue in Australia and
 that they are not and will not be tackled by the major parties.
 In developing a blueprint for change we prioritise an order
 in the change process on the basis of urgency and achievability.
 Therefore, what follows is an ambit package, eg. proportional
 representation for all Parliaments is high on the list, followed
 by the abolition of state upper houses, followed by the creation
 of a two-tier structure of elected government. Depending on
 the changing preferences of the Australian people some stages
 may be speeded up, collapsed or skipped altogether. What we
 present here is an overall concept for change.

<p>b/ Our principal policies for a new Republic are:

<l>President: elected DIRECTLY by the people, with symbolic powers
 only: 

<l>Note: the Irish Presidential model provides a useful guide: strictly
 symbolic powers unlike the present powers of either the Monarch
 or Australian Governor-General. In addition, persons who have
 been members of any Parliament during the past 10 years cannot
 be candidates. Steps would be enforced to prevent expenditure
 by parties or business interests of large sums of money to distort
 the result of the poll. 

<l>A President is needed to perform a variety of ceremonial and
 legislative functions. 

<l>Two-tier system of elected government:National government and
 a much strengthened local government system, coupled with administrative
 local government regions 

<l>Proportional Representation: aimed to create greater diversity
 in Parliament 

<l>Improvement in the Quality of Political Executive Government,
 with consideration of a number of options for democratisation
 and broadening of cabinet government in Australia. 

<l>Fixed four-year parliamentary terms 

<l>A comprehensive Bill of Rights 

<l>Safeguards for: (a) the environment;(b) Indigenous Peoples' rights;
 (c) other minority groups

<l>c/PLP policy is aimed at creating the Maximalist Republic, a
 Republic for the people, by the people and of the people - as
 it should be! A mere change of ceremonial Head of State would
 still leave Australia with a rigid and archaic constitution,
 an outmoded political system and a grossly unequal society.
 This would be piecemeal tinkering of the worst kind. The time
 has come to consider clear alternatives to the federal form
 of government, the two-party system, the electoral system and
 the scope of government. A Bill of Rights, constitutional protection
 of the environment and a conciliatory settlement of indigenous
 rights need to be incorporated in a Republican constitution.
 

<p>d/ The PLP has adopted the position that a sovereign people naturally
 have the unfettered right to rewrite and replace their constitution
 if they believe this to be a requirement for their survival,
 prosperity and improvement of their democracy. The PLP holds
 that what has happened in Australia in recent years is like
 putting the cart before the horse.

<p>Neither major party has a program for significant constitutional
 and political change.

<p>e/The notion that a government can be enterprising - and enabling
 - itself is the antithesis of the view that only private enterprise
 can deliver economic recovery, jobs and future prosperity for
 Australia. Many other countries, even those with a significant
 private sector, have entirely government-owned or jointly-owned
 public corporations to run key industries, e.g. France and Norway.
 As the PLP is of the view that Australia should aim at government
 enterprise rather than privatisation it becomes imperative to
 build real quality and independence into the Government and
 Parliaments and to ensure that Government and Parliaments cease
 to be the servants of powerful multinational corporations and
 financiers in the private sector.

<p>The reformist strategy is dealt with in three sections:

<p>SECTION 1: THE INADEQUACIES OF THE EXISTING POLITICAL SYSTEM;

<p>SECTION 2: A MAXIMALIST MODEL FOR POLITICAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL
 REFORM IN AUSTRALIA;

<p>SECTION 3: DRAFTING THE NEW CONSTITUTION, - CONSTITUTIONAL CONTINUITY,
 - LAUNCHING THE NEW CONSTITUTION BY MEANS OF SECTION 128.

<h>SECTION 1 The Inadequacies of the Existing Political System

<p>a/ The kind of question which Australians are now increasingly
 increasingly asking themselves in relation to the Republic is:
 What kind of a Republic do we really want? If Australians can
 reconstruct their political system to meet the demands of a
 society vastly different from Federation in 1900, having greatly
 advanced technology at its disposal and possessing superior
 transport and communication systems as well as physical resources,
 how will they do it? Would there still be any need for a federal
 system at all? Or would it be a huge hindrance to effective
 government? Would there still be need a for some 830 politicians?
 Should they introduce a two-tiered system of elected Government
 and enable the majority party or coalition to select the Ministry
 from outside Parliament rather than appoint career politicians?
 Surely the issue is no longer whether Australia should be a
 Republic OR continue to be an outpost of a rather shaky constitutional
 monarchy which has little interest in her distant Dominion.
 Improving the processes of Government in Australia, steeped
 in 200 years British colonial and Westminster traditions, is
 a task habitually avoided by both major parties. Unless it's
 done Australia may no longer in business on account of its antiquated
 constitution and political system. More likely it will be governed
 by the Boards of Directors of foreign Multi National Enterprises
 through a comprador class of well-paid compliant Australian
 managers and politicians. That trend is unmistakable already.
 The PLP intends to create a real democracy in Australia.

<p>b/ The domination by two major parties has led to an erosion
 of democracy and to a weakening of Government, often described
 as "the passing of Parliament". The electoral system has kept
 that now sterile, male dominated, two-party system in place
 for far too long. A greater variety of interests, persons and
 cultures should be represented in the National Parliament. The
 role of the citizens in constitutional change has been minimal
 and tokenistic. The initiative and timing of referendums is
 the prerogative of the Government of the day. Almost every constitutional
 referendum turns into a political slanging match regardless
 of the merits of the proposal(s). Only eight of many such referendums
 have been successful over the 100 years of federation. The rejection
 of the four proposals of the 1988 referendum demonstrated the
 present Constitution's dangerous inflexibility once again. Updating
 the Constitution has proven to be far too difficult. The result
 has been to devise expensive ways to circumvent it, often unsuccessfully,
 a recipe for stagnation and deterioration.

<p>c/The PLP's answer to these problems is that the piecemeal tinkering
 must end. Australians need to rewrite the entire constitution.
 The idea that the constitution cannot be replaced by another
 one, supposedly because it can only be amended (and then only
 in terms of the highly unsatisfactory amending clause, section
 128), is no more than a legal fiction. It suggests that the
 legal system ultimately rules Australia rather than the people.
 This line of argument, frequently voiced by so-called constitutional
 experts, suggests that today's Australians are shackled by past
 agreements among some of the citizens who voted on the 1900
 Constitution Draft in a VOLUNTARY referendum 100 YEARS AGO.

<h>SECTION 2: A Maximalist Model for Political and Constitutional
 Reform in Australia

<p>2a/ The phoney Minimalist Republic 'debate' resulted in the Constitutional
 Convention of February, 1998. The Convention was dominated by
 conservative politicians, Minimalist candidates of the ARM and
 the pro-monarchist candidates. However, a vocal minority of
 Maximalist candidates presented the kind of arguments which
 are embodied in PLP policy as well. In addition, the Australian
 voters favour a directly elected President a fact that the conservative
 majority at the Convention found hard to deal with. We have
 incorporated that wish also in our policy.

<p>2b/That policy now follows:

<h>A. Head of State to be directly elected by the Australian people.

<p>Head of State to have essentially symbolic powers, plus some
 reserve powers aimed essentially at breaking legislative deadlocks.
 In the event of legislative deadlock the President convenes
 a joint sitting of Parliament where a majority can resolve the
 matter, or otherwise a referendum is called.

<p>The PLP does not favour the US-style Presidential system or a
 dual executive structure (as for instance in France).

<h>B. The Prime Minister will remain the effective Head of Government.

<p>This official is the leader of the party or coalition of parties
 which command majority support on the floor of the House of
 Representatives

<h>C. * The PLP is most concerned with the lack of quality in political
 executive government.

<p>We propose a democratisation and broadening of cabinet government
 in Australia, including consideration of :

<p>  

<l>Inclusion of ministers with appropriate expertise and experience
 from outside of Parliament (as is the practice in most overseas
 countries); 

<l>Nomination of ministers not only by the Prime Minister but also
 by unions and community organisations in their sphere of responsibility;
 

<l>Election of cabinet by the whole of parliament, instead of appointment
 by prime minister or factional leaders; 

<l>Direct election by voters of all executive/cabinet positions;
 

<l>All ministers to be responsible to parliament, and subject to
 recall at any time.

<l>Ministerial Codes of Conduct

<p>We endorse the creation of codes of conduct for each Ministerial
 Department in order to enshrine a character of ethics and accountability
 to the decision making processes and to ensure that the Universal
 Human Rights of the UN Charter and a concern for the welfare
 of all people becomes the fundamental basis for all policy making.

<h>D. Measures to end to the domination of the National Parliament
 by two parties.

<p>The PLP calls for a referendum to introduce Proportional Representation
 by means of the Hare-Clark system based on multi-member electoral
 districts (these districts could be same as the administrative
 regions for local governments.)

<p>This would provide scope for the representation of more parties
 and Independents - provided they would have minum support of,
 say, 4% or 5% in a nine-member district. This would also end
 the single-member (district) system, pork barrelling, by-elections,
 neglected seats (safe seats), electoral boundary changes and
 the adversarial mode of debate.

<p>The proportion of votes required for representation in a district
 would not be able to be raised without a referendum or some
 other means of democratic consultation. This is to ensure that
 major parties in a district cannot simply vote together and
 raise the percentage without community consultation, in order
 to reduce the representation of smaller rival parties and independents.

<p>A system of 30 electoral districts, each returning nine members,
 would yield a 270 member legislature (House of Representatives).
 Add to this three Senators per district (possibly not belonging
 to any party) and a total of 360 MPs would represent the nation
 in Canberra. That would be less than half the present total
 number if the states are abolished. The Hare Clark system is
 well known in Australia as it is used in Tasmania, the ACT,
 and for the present Senate elections. It is preferred over other
 PR systems, such as list PR systems and the NZ MMD system of
 PR (based on the German system).

<p>The Senate would retain its present powers and functions.

<p>The Senate , already elected by PR - Hare Clarke now (although
 distorted by "malapportionment" on account of the federal system
 and state representation) would retain its present powers and
 functions. However, in the PLP proposal Senators would not represent
 the abolished states. The principal functions of the Senate
 would be legislative review and holding Parliamentary inquiries
 as at present. The PLP would remove the power of blocking Supply
 .

<p>The PLP favours the Robson Rotation system for PR (used in the
 ACT, and Tasmania) with the right to discontinue the allocation
 of preferences beyond the number of vacant positions. the PLP
 supports Voter-determined Above-the-line or Under-the-line Optional
 Preference Voting. Compulsory voting will be retained.

<h>E. The introduction of a FIXED four-year terms for the National
 Parliament and Government -

<p>with provision for optional early elections only if a Government
 has lost majority support in the House of Representatives, and
 after exhausting all options of forming a new government under
 the existing parliament.

<p>Fixed-term parliaments are supported by many people but the major
 parties won't take steps to introduce this reform once in power.
 The advantages are widely accepted though. It provides time
 to implement policy and predictability. It reduces uncertainty
 and the frequency of elections.

<p>Change the electoral law or write it into the new constitution.

<h>F. The creation of a two-tiersystem of elected government with
 STRONG local government units.

<p>The present states could be replaced by smaller, administrative
 regions indirectly elected by groups of local councils and/or
 on some BioRegional principle. Special separate City Administrations
 could be established modelled perhaps on the Greater Brisbane
 Council.

<p>This would reduce direct popular elections to two levels: the
 national and local levels.

<p>The regions could be grafted onto the local government tier.
 Already an extensive system of voluntary regional councils exists
 which could be a base to start from. The savings of such measures
 have been estimated to be in the order of many billions of dollars
 (possibly $30 billion p.a., Drummond in Hall, 1998) depending
 on what model of regional administration is adopted. E.g. Drummond
 has developed detailed scenarios of such options by means of
 cost/benefit analyses based on applications of linear regression
 techniques to State, Territory and Local Government outlay as
 well as population data.

<p>The need for special regions to ensure representation for sparsely
 populated outlying areas is acknowledged and will be accommodated.

<p>Existing powers and responsibilities of the states would be redistributed
 between national and regional governing bodies.

<p>The PLP greatly favours the strengthening of local government,
 both in terms of funding and functions. In order to effectively
 extend functions critical mass needs to be achieved and some
 smaller local government units would need to be amalgamated.
 Certain functions which are now the domain of state governments
 will be transferred to local government of sufficient size and
 capacity to handle them. In addition, the PLP will introduce
 the precinct (or ward) system to ensure maximum community involvement
 in local government - and generally promote grassroots democracy
 in every way possible.

<p>In 1900 an excellent case could be made for a federal structure.
 A lot has changed since then. Communications and transport systems
 have improved dramatically. In 2000 a country of only 19 million
 people does not need a federal structure, seven different administrations
 plus that of the Northern Territory and ACT. All the reasons
 for federation have long disappeared!

<p>As a first step the PLP advocates the abolition of the state
 upper houses by means of state referendums - assuming that our
 priority No. 1, the introduction of PR for state lower houses,
 has first been achieved. This would then be followed by a campaign
 to abolish the states altogether.

<h>G. The introduction of a Bill of Rights, including a preamble
 concerning the rights of Indigenous people and providing a conciliatory
 settlement with similar status and protection as a Bill of Rights.

<p>The protection of human rights and special minorities will also
 be included in a Bill of Rights.

<h>H. The introduction of national environmental aims and safeguards

<p>together with ways of redress and compensation where a community¹s
 or industry's livelihood is adversely affected.

<h>I. The amendment procedure for the new Constitution will be simple.

<p>The new Constitution can be amended in two ways:

<p>ONE: by a 3/4 majority of all National Parliamentarians of both
 Houses of Parliament voting jointly

<p>OR by a binding, mandatory national referendum which can be introduced
 in two ways:

<l>Initiated by the Government of the day 

<l>Initiated by the people on the basis of a petition signed by
 1% of the electors on the national electoral roll

<l> J. Review of Constitution procedure

<p>The new Constitution needs to be extensively reviewed after every
 five years. The review need to be given wide publicity and adjustment
 facilitated.

<h>SECTION 3: Drafting the New Constitution, - Constitutional Continuity,
 - Launching the New Constitution by means of Section 128

<h>K. Who would draft the New Constitution?

<p>The PLP recommends a panel of 50 persons representing various
 key constituencies of all age groups and all classes in society.
 These should be in a position to consult extensively with their
 constituencies . Politicians should number no more than five
 and constitutional experts would be equally limited to five.
 There could be five foreign constitutional experts to provide
 input.

<h>L. Continuity

<p>It is desirable that the Constitution has a link with the old
 one and provides continuity in spite of introducing radical
 changes. Many new Constitutions of national states have been
 the outcome of great political and/or social upheavals, major
 crises such as wars, a struggle for independence, civil unrest
 and secession. However, this does not mean that states which
 are not subject to such major crises (a) therefore have no need
 for major changes to the ground rules of their governmental
 system; (b) that such changes as are needed cannot be achieved
 in a civil, democratic and peaceful manner. After all major
 crises are almost always the result of inadequate, evolutionary
 adjustment.

<p>Moreover, the notion that Australia is free from crisis at present
 would be challenged by many and denied only by the ultra conservative
 and foolhardy. It has become a very unequal country in recent
 decades with many pressing social issues. In economic terms
 Australia is struggling to maintain its independence and achieve
 greater competitiveness. International capital is increasingly
 dictating her destiny. Australia's present Constitution and
 political system has severe constraints which, the PLP maintains,
 cannot be remedied by ineffectual piecemeal tinkering at the
 margins.

<h>M. Launching the New Constitution through Section 128 - an evolutionary
 method

<p>The principal problem in having a constitutional referendum accepted
 has been the requirement laid down in Section 128 that , apart
 from a national majority, there has to be "majority in a majority
 of states". Clearly this represents a bias in favour of the
 federal system itself. In order to alleviate this problem, an
 undemocratic feature of the present Constitution the cause of
 much rigidity and expense, the following strategy is recommended:

<p>In a "New Constitution Referendum" there could be two questions
 in order to overcome the "majority of states" problem, as follows:

<l>For the purpose of voting on this New Constitution Package are
 you in favour of disregarding a requirement of Section 128 that
 a constitutional referendum needs to be carried by a majority
 of states? YES/NO 

<l>Do you support the proposition that the New Constitutional Package
 should replace the present Constitution in its entirety? YES/NO
