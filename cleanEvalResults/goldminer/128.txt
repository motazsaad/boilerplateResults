<h>Abstract

<p> We present recent results on bulk GaN crystallization. The best
 quality GaN crystals grown from the solution at high N2 pressure
 without an intentional seeding are single crystalline platelets
 of stable morphology reaching dimensions up to 10 mm. The fastest
 growth direction for such crystals is [1 0  0], perpendicular
 to the GaN c-axis. The maximum stable growth rate perpendicular
 to crystal c-axis is determined from the experiment and used
 for an estimate of the effective supersaturation for the {100}
 face assuming two dimensional layer growth. The heat of GaN
 disssolution, determined from experimental solubility data,
 is used for the estimation of the edge energy of 2-D nuclei
 on the growing {100} face. Bulk crystal growth seeded by a single
 hexagonal needle with well developed {100} faces is also reported.
 The crystallization mechanisms and morphological stability in
 seeded growth of GaN are discussed on the basis of experimental
 results. The physical properties of the GaN crystals and homoepitaxial
 layers grown on them are briefly reviewed.

<p> GaN is a strongly bonded compound well suited for applications
 such as high power, high temperature electronics. The bonding
 energy of GaN is 8.9 eV/atom whereas for GaAs it is only 6.5
 eV/atom [1]. Consequently, the free energy G(T) of the crystal
 is very low in relation to the reference state of free N and
 Ga atoms. On the other hand, the N2 molecule is also strongly
 bonded (4.9eV/atom). Therefore, the free energy of the constituent
 Ga and N2 becomes quite close and surpasses that of GaN as the
 temperature is raised. Figure 1 shows the free energy of GaN
 (1 mole) versus its constituents (Ga + 1/2N2) as a function
 of temperature. 

<p> The G(T) of the constituents decreases faster than that of the
 GaN crystal and at higher temperatures GaN become thermodynamically
 unstable. The crossing of G(T) curves determines the equilibrium
 temperature where GaN coexists with its constituents at a given
 N2 pressure. The application of pressure allows us to increase
 the free energy of the constituents much more than that of the
 crystal shifting the equilibrium point to higher temperature
 and extending the stability range of GaN. The equilibrium pN2
 - T conditions for GaN determined experimentally by Karpinski
 et al.[2][3] are shown in Figure 2.

<p> Most of crystallization processes discussed in this paper have
 been carried-out in large volume gas pressure reactors at an
 N2 overpressure of up to 15 kbar, which corresponds to a GaN
 stability limit at 1850K. The maximum temperature of 1850 K
 is quite far from the melting temperature of GaN. According
 to the theoretical estimation of Van Vechten [4] the melting
 point of GaN is ~3000K. The N2 equilibrium pressure at the melting
 point is therefore much higher than we can obtain in our experimental
 system. The extension of the GaN stability range to 1850 K allows
 the growth of GaN crystals from a liquid Ga solution. In Figure
 3 we show the N solubility data resulting from the annealing
 of Ga at the three phase equilibrium conditions of Figure 2.
 

<p> Since the N concentrations are not high, the growth experiments
 have to be long to obtain high quality bulk GaN crystals with
 dimensions appropriate for measurements and applications. Therefore,
 stability over a long time (&gt;100h) is an additional requirement
 for the growth system. The solid line in Figure 3 is the liquidus
 line for Ga-GaN system calculated using an ideal solution approximation
 and Van Vechten's melting temperature of 2790K. For an ideal
 solution, the solubility can be expressed as:

<p>
 where Hsol is the heat of dissolution. For GaN, Hsol = 44.7
 kcal/mole = 0.49 eV/bond and expresses the bonding energy in
 the crystal in relation to its mother phase: the solution.

<h> The growth system is designed for the crystallization of GaN
 from solution under high N2 overpressure at high temperature
 in relatively large volumes. Since the material to be grown
 is a semiconductor for optoelectronic applications, the system
 has to fullfil all the requirements concerning purity and control
 of the growth conditions. Moreover, crystallization from a dilute
 solution requires lengthy processes of ~100 hours. Therefore,
 the high pressure - high temperature crystallization reactor
 (chamber and multizone furnace) has to be supplied with additional
 systems necessary for:

<l> in situ annealing in vacuum 

<l> electronic stabilization and programming of pressure 

<l> electronic stabilization and programming of temperature 

<l> pressure, temperature, voltage and current sensitive alarms
 

<l> cooling of the pressure chamber In Figure 4 we have shown schematically
 such an experimental apparatus. Many functions mentioned above
 are realized by the use of standard commercially available devices
 ( e.g. vacuum pumps, temperature programmers, mass flow detectors...).
 The pressure in the chamber is stabilized with a precision better
 than 20 bar. The temperature is measured by a set of thermocouples
 arranged along the furnace and coupled with the standard input
 power control electronic system. This allows the stabilization
 of temperature better than 0.5 deg., and the ability to program
 changes in the furnace temperature distribution during the experiment.

<p> Supersaturation in the growth solution has been created by the
 application of temperature gradients along the axis of the crucible.
 Both horizontal and vertical arrangements of the crucibles have
 been used. The typical duration of the experiments was 100 -
 150 hours for crystals of 6-10 mm in size.

<p> Gallium, when heated under high N2 pressure, does not wet the
 crucible walls (usually graphite or BN). Rather, it is covered
 with a thin GaN layer consisting of GaN single crystals. This
 is the first step of GaN crystallization at high N2 pressure.
 The size of the crystals covering the Ga depends on the sequence
 and rates of compression and heating of the system. A typical
 structure of the surface layer is shown in Figure 5.

<p> The formation of the surface layer inhibits further synthesis
 of the nitride which allows longtime crystallization processes
 and the growth of relatively large GaN crystals. Since the solution
 is in a temperature gradient, the GaN layer at the hot end of
 the crucible dissolves in gallium and is transported, by convection
 and diffusion, to the cooler zone of the crucible where the
 solution become supersaturated and crystallization of GaN takes
 place. The crystals of the surface layer are the natural source
 of growth centers for further crystallization. Some of them
 start to grow faster hindering the growth of the neighboring
 ones. This selection leads to the formation of relatively large,
 well shaped GaN crystals on the internal surface of the surface
 layer.

<p> The GaN crystals grown by this method are wurzite, mainly in
 the form of hexagonal platelets or hexagonal needles, depending
 on the growth conditions. A general tendency is that high supersaturation
 favors growth in the c-direction which produces the needle-like
 crystals. Supersaturation of the growth solution is determined
 mainly by the growth temperature, supercooling, mass transport
 mechanisms in Ga, and also the local surroundings for a particular
 crystal.

<p> Crystals in the form of hexagonal platelets grow slowly, with
 a rate &lt;0.1 mm/h into the {100} directions (perpendicular
 to the c-axis). They are usually single crystals having perfect
 morphology suggesting stable layer-by layer growth. They are
 transparent, colorless, with flat faces. In some cases, three
 dimensional, hexagonal growth which occurs during the post-growth
 system cooling is observed on the crystal surfaces. Some GaN
 platelets grown without intentional seeding are shown in Figure
 6.

<p> For crystallization of large GaN crystals by this method, it
 is crucial to control the supersaturation to avoid acceleration
 of the growth near the edges and corners of the growing crystal.
 This can occur if some of them reach dimensions significantly
 larger than the others. Then the edge nucleation on the hexagonal
 faces of the GaN platelets is often observed. This is the first
 step to unstable growth on these faces. The result of such a
 growth is shown in Figure 7a. In extreme cases of very high
 supersaturation or when the supersaturation is abruptly increased
 (i.e. by increasing the temperature gradient), the growth into
 c-direction, nucleated at the edges of the platelet, become
 very fast and leads to the formation of well developed {100}
 faces. This results in a hollow needle-like crystal such as
 is shown in Figure 7b. Therefore, for growing of large GaN platelets
 of stable morphology, the supersaturation must be decreased
 during the crystallization process inorder to prevent the runaway
 phenomena just described.

<p> Therefore for the stable growth of large GaN crystals it is
 necessary to have sufficiently low and uniform supersaturation
 across the growing crystal faces. One of the most important
 factors influencing the uniformity of N-concentration in the
 growth zone is the volume of the solution in relation to the
 size of the growing crystal. In Figure 8 we show a crystal grown
 in a crucible with an internal diameter of 17 mm (as opposed
 to 14 mm previously). The increase in the crucible volume resulted
 in a significant increase of the size of crystals which could
 be grown with stable morphology.

<p> We summarize the general tendencies of GaN crystal growth without
 an intentional seeding following from the experimental results:

<l> The growth of GaN crystals from a diluted solution in liquid
 gallium is strongly anisotropic. 

<l> At lower supersaturations, the fastest growth directions are
 the [1 0  0 ] ones, perpendicular to the c-axis of the crystal.
 The growth rate in the [ 0 0 0 1 ] directions, parallel to the
 c-axis is then extremely slow. This results in thin hexagonal
 platelets. 

<l> With increasing supersaturation, the rate of the growth parallel
 to the c-axis abruptly increases, resulting in needle like crystals
 with well developed {100} faces. We have estimated the supersaturation
 at which high quality GaN platelet grow at a rate of 0.1 mm/h.
 in the [1 0  0] direction (see Figure 9). For the estimation,
 we assumed two dimensional layer-by-layer growth on the {100}
 face of the platelet with a thickness of 0.1 mm and length of
 the leading edge of 1 mm. We also assumed that the creation
 of a 2-D critical nucleus on the crystal face results in the
 growth of a new layer. That is, the lateral growth rate is fast
 enough to complete the plane before appearance of the next nucleus
 of the critical size. A heat of GaN dissolution in liquid Ga
 of 0.49eV/bond (see Introduction) was used as a measure of bond
 energy in the crystal in relation to the liquid phase.

<p> For a crystal growing at 1800K, we have obtained a supersaturation
 of the order of 50%. For the growth of GaN on a seed crystal
 with well developed {100} faces, the supersaturation necessary
 for stable two dimensional growth can be significantly lower
 due to large surface area of the fast growing planes. The details
 of this estimation will be published elsewhere [5].

<h> Knowing that GaN in our experimental conditions prefers to grow
 in a stable way in directions perpendicular to the c-axis, we
 decided to use a needle like crystal to seed the growth on the
 {100} faces. In Figure 10, we show the seed crystal which was
 introduced into the cooler zone of the vertical crucible. It
 had well developed {100} prismatic faces and also {101} pyramidal
 ones. A hexagonal surface did not appear due to the fast growth
 of the needle in c-direction.

<p> Prior to the growth, it was necessary to heat the system up
 to 1200oC at low N2 pressure to achieve wetting of the seed
 with liquid Ga. If the sysyem were be heated at high pressure,
 the polycrystalline surface layer would cover the Ga surface
 adjacent to the seed, and eliminate its usefulness for further
 crystallization.

<p> The growth on the seed was performed under conditions where
 high quality platelets were obtained in previously described
 processes without intentional seeding. The resulting crystal,
 after 50 hours of growth, is shown in Figure 11.

<p> The fast growth directions were the [1 0  0], as expected, and
 also the [1 0  1] one perpendicular to the pyramidal face. Since
 the growth rate in the c-direction was very small, a hexagonal
 face developed in the resulting crystal.

<p> As we know from previous considerations, at low supersaturations,
 the growth rate in c-direction is almost zero whereas at higher
 supersaturations we fall into the "difficult" region of the
 abrupt increase of the nucleation rate. Therefore, the growth
 on the hexagonal face is difficult to control and probably is
 very sensitive to fluctuations of temperature, convectional
 flows and uniformity of the nitrogen concentration field in
 the crystal surrounding. This can easily lead to three dimensional
 nucleation or to edge instabilities of the growth.

<p> The quality of the GaN crystals was estimated by X-ray rocking
 curves[6]. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the X-ray
 rocking curves ((0004) CuK reflection) depends on the size of
 the crystal. The value is 20-30 arcsec for 1mm crystals and
 30-40 arcsec for 1-3 mm ones. For larger platelets the rocking
 curves split into a few 30-40 arcsec peaks showing the presence
 of low angle (1-3 arcmin) boundaries separating grains of 0.5-2
 mm in size. Misorientation between grains increases monotonically
 from end to end of the crystal [7]. This indicates a "bending"
 of the crystal during growth, followed by strain relaxation
 leading to the formation of the low angle boundaries. Indeed,
 the lattice constantsmeasured for the two basal planes of the
 crystals differ by 0.001 &#187;, suggesting different growth
 mechanisms and defect structures for the two polar directions
 of the GaN platelet. It was shown by Liliental-Weber et al.
 [8] by TEM examination and confirmed by AFM studies [9], that
 one of the polar surfaces of the GaN crystals (especially for
 the smaller ones) is often atomically flat (2-3 monolayer steps
 present) and the crystal below is practically free of extended
 defects. However a high concentration of point defects, mainly
 N-vacancies and Ga-antisites, were deduced from Convergent Beam
 Electron Diffraction patterns [8]. On the opposite side, regular
 pyramids of 100 - 200 &#187; in size terminate the surface [8][9].
 Below are many extended defects such as stacking faults, dislocation
 loops and Ga micro-precipitates. Such pecularities result from
 the different growth modes of the two polar directions of the
 crystal in the Ga-rich conditions of the process.

<p> For larger (&gt;3 mm) GaN plateletes, the presence of three
 dimensional hexagonal features on the surfaces is typical. This
 results from the system cooling after the growth in the temperature
 gradient.

<p> The GaN crystals are highly conductive, showing metallic behavior
 in the whole temperature range of 4.2-300K. Free electron concentration
 of 1019 - 1020 cm-3 with mobilities of 30-90 cm2/Vs [10] are
 present regardless of temperature. No clear dependence of the
 electrical properties on the growth conditions has been observed.
 Both ab initio calculations of electronic structure of GaN native
 defects [11][12] and experiments [13] confirm that the source
 of free electrons in this GaN is N-vacancies.

<p> The optical absorption spectra of pressure-grown GaN crystals
 and epitaxial GaN layers with a free electron concentration
 of 6x1017 cm-3 have been measured by Teisseyre et al.[14]. A
 shift to high energy of the optical absorption edge for the
 bulk sample is observed and assigned to the Burstein-Moss effect
 [14]. Due to this shift, the bulk GaN substrate crystals are
 transparent to near edge luminescence of GaN.

<p> The dominant luminescence features of GaN bulk crystals are
 near band edge emission at ~3.5 eV and a broad yellow luminescence
 band centered around 2.3 eV.

<p> The first results of homoepitaxial growth of GaN MOCVD layers
 have been recently reported [15]. Pressure grown GaN crystals
 were used as substrates. The layers were grown in a horizontal
 atmospheric pressure Epigress system adapted to the growth of
 nitrides. TMG and NH3 were used as sources of Ga and N, and
 H2 was the carrier gas. The substrates did not require any mechanical
 or chemical surface treatment before the growth. Also the deposition
 of a low temperature buffer layer was omitted. The growth temperature
 was 900 - 1050&#176;C. P-doping was realized using the MCp2Mg
 metalorganic and subsequent annealing of the layer at 700&#176;C
 in the presence of N2 gas. Si was introduced to achieve n-doping
 of the layers.

<p> Atomic Force Microscopy studies performed on homoepitaxially
 grown GaN layers indicate the presence of monatomic steps on
 the layer surfaces, often in the form of large diameter (100
 m) spirals indicating two dimensional growth on screw dislocations.

<p> The X-ray diffraction peaks from the homoepitaxial layer and
 from GaN substrate from [7] are shown in Figure 12. The lattice
 constant parallel to the interface is the same for both the
 substrate and homolayer, whereas the c constant of the epilayer
 is smaller by about 0.02%. The increase of the c lattice constant
 of the bulk GaN crystals is related to the presence of the same
 point defects responsible for the high concentration of free
 electrons. 

<p> The high quality of the homoepitaxial layers is confirmed by
 the photoluminescence measurements [15]. The spectrum is dominated
 by two strong and narrow lines XD (3.4719 eV) and XA (3.4666
 eV) related to the excitons bound to neutral impurity centers
 [15]. The FWHM of these lines is about1.8 meV and 1.0 meV respectively.
 The higher energy XD line shows a double peak structure which
 fitted with Lorenzian curves can be described by energies: E1
 = 3.4711 eV, E2 = 3.4720 eV. The photoluminescence and reflectivity
 of GaN homoepitaxial layers are analyzed in detail in [15].
 Also the lifetime of the bound excitons has been measured [16]
 to be 650 and 700 ps for excitons bound to the neutral donor
 and acceptor, respectively. This is much higher than the corresponding
 values for GaN/sapphire (70 and 140 ps, respectively).

<p> The PL spectra for p-type Mg doped GaN homoepitaxial layers
 have been reported [17]. In addition to the XD and XA exciton
 lines (XA line much stronger than for undoped layers), a series
 of very narrow lines attributed to donor-acceptor pair related
 transitions have been observed between 3.4 - 3.5 eV. The FWHM
 of these lines were &lt; 0.5 meV. The PL lines observed for
 MOCVD grown homoepitaxial layers are the narrowest so far reported
 for GaN.

<p> Recently very high quality homoepitaxial layer have been obtained
 by MBE [18]. The nearedge photoluminescence spectrum of this
 layer is dominated by XD and XA peaks and 3 lines corresponding
 to free excitons. The PL lines for this layer are even sharper
 than for best MOCVD samples. The halfwidth of the XA line is
 smaller than 0.5 meV

<p> High quality GaN crystals can be grown at nitrogen pressure
 up to 15 kbar. The main obstacle to growing larger substrate
 sized GaN crystals is instability of the growth. The instability
 is related to the non-uniform distribution of nitrogen in the
 solution due to the small volume of the crucible in relation
 to the size of growing GaN crystals.

<p> It is shown that high quality homoepitaxial layers can be obtained
 on the "as grown", single crystalline, pressure grown GaN substrates.
 Further optimization of both substrate and homoepitaxial growth
 techniques should lead to the fabrication of efficient optoelectronic
 devices. Special effort has to be paid to increasing of the
 size of high quality GaN substrates.
