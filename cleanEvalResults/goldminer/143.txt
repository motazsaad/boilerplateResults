<p>
 This is our 15th year doing outreach around the State of Oregon
 and occasionally into Washington and California.  We visit approximately
 300 classrooms each school year, fairly evenly distributed in
 grade levels.

<p>LOGISTICS OF OUTREACH SESSIONS: (contents in next section)

<p>
 General Info:  I'm (Rick Kang) probably the person that will
 come to your classroom.  The program is a collaborative extension
 of University of Oregon's Professor Greg Bothun's "Electronic
 Universe" project (see http://zebu.uoregon.edu).
 We may have
 other outreach instructors available during the year, particularly
 in the Portland and Central Oregon areas.  We create specific
 sessions for each class, grade appropriate, and addressing specific
 topics you want covered.
 The program fits into many areas of
 science curriculum FOR ALL GRADE LEVELS INCLUDING EARLY ELEMENTARY.
  Content tie-ins can be forces, motion, cycles, electricity,
 matter and energy, radiation/waves, general physical science,
 and some areas of geology, meteorology, and ecology.  Within
 a specific Earth Science/Astronomy program, the Electronic Universe
 can serve well as an introduction to how we probe deep space
 as well as answering students' questions later on and providing
 a capstone conclusional activity such as one of our digital
 labs (see below for details).

<p>
 The overall program is called the Electronic Universe because
 we use and present a lot of electronics and digital technology.
  We feature three major digital items: Professor Bothun's new
 JAVA (interactive web-based) virtual physics labs/demos, projects
 using a CCD (digital camera), and Oregon Research Institute's
 new Sun-Earth-Moon virtual reality software.

<p>
 I like at least 60-90 minutes, but we can do a 30-45 minute
 session or multiple sessions.  I don't mind doing several repeat
 sessions during a day.  Minimally, I bring a laptop and LCD
 projector, so the room needs to have a screen, be darkenable,
 and have a table for the projector and computer.  If we are
 doing any of the technology pieces, then I bring in a portable
 CCD Camera and/or a small Telescope.  If we are doing basic
 Solar System/Sun-Earth-Moon, we may do some activities outdoors
 (scale models, and solar viewing).  
 For the technology/measuring
 the sky program, there is extensive hardware setup, about 30
 minutes, and also similar take-down time, and several boxes
 of gear to transport, so placing me in one location and rotating
 classes in works best.  Since we do a lot of "hands-on" activities,
 classes should be under 30 students.  We have found that "assemblies"
 don't work for our main inquiry-based type of program.   If
 you'd like a show-and-tell or pictureshow type of general program
 for an assembly, that can be arranged, but our program is primarily
 an inquiry-based introduction to the science of astrophysics,
 with a lot of participatory activities.
 My schedule can get
 booked full particularly in the Spring, so please contact me
 several weeks in advance if possible.

<p>
 Costwise, this year (2005)we are requesting between $10 and
 $100 per school, regardless of number of classes done, on a
 sliding scale, generally proportionate to the number of classes
 done but with consideration of available school budget. (Example:
 1 small class would be $10, a small &#8220;assembly&#8221; or
 morning&#8217;s worth of individual classes might be $30, a
 multi-day presentation to six classes would approach $100.)
  This amount goes to Friends of Pine Mountain Observatory, not
 to the instructor, and  is used to offset our overhead costs,
 primarily the production/distribution of the prep video, curriculum
 materials, and hardware usage.  NASA's Oregon Space Grant currently
 covers instructor cost and travel costs for trips throughout
 western Oregon.  For extended distant trips, we may request
 some additional funding to help cover the travel expenses. 
 Visiting multiple destinations during one trip will help share
 costs.

<p>CONTENTS OF OUTREACH CLASS SESSIONS:
 Variety of programs for
 ALL grade levels:

<p>
 The basic presentation covers how students at any grade level
 can do real science with the Sky by making observations and
 measurements.  For grade 4 and higher we provide an introduction
 to how data can be collected digitally, and how digital data
 can be measured and put to use.  We generally don't present
 historical narratives, collections of statistics, nor cover
 constellation information or lore (we can point you to resources
 for these topics).

<p>
 Prep session, prior to outreach, is very important, particularly
 to clarify vocabulary of objects and vastness of space.  See
 below for suggested topics, and about the new free prep video.

<p>
 Basic Theme: Surveying the Sky:  If we examine the sky with
 our eyes, with a telescope, or with a camera, what do we see?

<p>
 Can we characterize and classify objects by making observations?

 Sorting out objects by apparent size and brightness.
 Observing
 change in appearance and position over time.
 Arranging our
 data to use the data to draw rational conclusions.
 Making models
 to explain our observations.
 What are "physical characteristics"
 of objects/phenomena?
 Can we measure such characteristics of
 very distant objects?

<p>
 We are concerned with the inquiry-based process of scientific
 research, not with "factoids".  Our program stays away from
 "factoids" and does not deal with topics such as constellation
 lore/history (although these topics are excellent cross-curriculum
 content!)  Often we deal with questions that do not have a "right
 answer" nor even any answer at this time.
 We encourage students
 to collect and evaluate data.

<p>
 Integrated with the above investigative strategies, here are
 some of the specific content areas that we can work with your
 students to explore:

<p>a. Introduction to the Solar System:  Sun-Earth-Moon and beyond:
  We can address motions/views of Sun-Earth-Moon and Solar System,
 using kinesthetic models, a new dynamic virtual reality graphical
 model, scale models, and lots of images from various professional
 sources.  Why are planets and stars spherical?  Why do they
 rotate?  Why do the planets orbit the Sun in a plane?  Why do
 we see the Moon and certain planets only at certain times? 
 This program is suitable for early elementary, and can be adapted
 for higher grades where students need information for the Common
 Curriculum Goals Earth-in-Space Benchmarks.

<p>b. Introduction to Technologies to Explore Deep Space:
 How we
 know what we know about very distant objects/phenomena: 
 We
 bring a small Telescope plus a portable CCD Camera that students
 can use to explore how distant light is collected and detected,
 and how digital images can be enhanced and measured.  What are
 the two basic measurements?  What can these measurements tell
 us about characteristics of distant objects?  This material
 is very suitable for grades 4-12 and portions can be adapted
 for early elementary.
 We also use a variety of high tech JAVA
 based interactive graphical "applets" developed by Professor
 Greg Bothun at U of O to illustrate various principles of physics
 and astrophysics such as production of photons, production of
 thermal spectrum, and nature of detectors.
 Greg and ORI are
 both developing new virtual lab activities and we'll showcase
 these as they become available.

<p>c. Computer Labs: Two years ago we commenced this activity, six
 schools, from grades 3-12 were successful.  We preload free
 FITSVIEW image analysis software plus a series of images to
 analyze.   There are four pairs of images taken one night apart,
 that have one of the four outer planets (Saturn-Pluto) in each
 pair of images.  The job of the students is to find the planet
 in each pair of images and then to identify which planet by
 measuring relative shift from night to night and also comparing
 brightness. We do this as a follow-up to the in-class session
 described in part b, above.  If your school has a Windows or
 Mac lab, you can participate.

<p>d. Overview of the Cassini-Hugens Mission to Saturn and Titan:
  A powerpoint presentation covering overview of mission, spacecraft,
 flight, scientific goals, and showing current images sent back
 from Saturn and its Moons.  This program will work for larger
 groups/assemblies.  We do some scale model activities but primarily
 focus on the information and pictures supplied by NASA and JPL.
  We furnish teachers with a summary handout sheet including
 URLs.

<p>WORKSHEETS and EVALUATION SHEETS:

<p>
 Most teachers have requested use of worksheets for classes
 at 5th grade level and higher.  We normally bring a fill-in-the-blank
 style worksheet for duplication and distribution at start of
 class.  
 We can send the master to you ahead of time if you
 wish to print it beforehand.
 Sometimes we encourage students
 to use a blank piece of paper and then we make notes together
 on a projected window from the laptop.
 We supply a key for
 the teacher for use in review after the class.
 We also bring
 a page for students with a few questions to fill out for feedback
 for us on how the classes can be improved, and we supply teachers
 with a more detailed questionaire.  These surveys can be mailed
 back to me and are usually done for homework or the next day,
 as our sessions usually run the whole class period.

<p>
 PREP VIDEO

<p>
 Tom Cleveland, of Think Video/Lane Community Cable Television,
 and I, have put together a 28-minute introductory video for
 use prior to the outreach sessions, or as a stand-alone INTRODUCTION
 to EXPLORING DEEP SPACE.  The material is suitable for ALL grade
 levels, but particularly suitable for Elementary and Middle
 School.  We start with a brief introduction to the emptiness
 of space by taking an imaginary flight upward from Earth, noting
 the results and requirements of leaving the atmosphere and running
 out of air.
 Next we cover, using models, the vocabulary of
 Moon, Planet, Star/Sun, Solar System, Nebula, Galaxy, and Universe.
  Then we create a scale model of the Solar System and beyond
 on a real football field, an activity you can duplicate.  

 Finally we explore the basic concepts of light, introducing
 viewers to the term "photons", and noting that to "see" anything
 we need a source of photons and a detector of photons (stars
 and our eyes).  We tie the whole program together with a final
 demonstration with a flashlight to show how photons from a distant
 source spread out, thus why objects in deep space are so dim,
 so hard to explore.  
 The actual classroom outreach program
 then gives the students the opportunities to explore the collection/detection/measuring
 technologies (telescopes and CCD cameras) and includes computer
 labs where actual research can be done.  
 When you contact
 me to schedule your outreach session, I'll mail you a prep video
 along with several worksheets and answer keys to complement
 the video.  I'll pick up the video when I come to your classroom.
  There is no cost for the video, but we do need it returned.

<p>
 Responses have been very positive from Elementary and Middle
 Schoolers.  Most High School students have felt that the video
 was too simplistic for them, although some have commented that
 the concepts/overview have been very helpful.

<p>
 Our major concern is that students have the overview of vast
 distances, hierarchy/vocabulary of types of objects, and initial
 exposure to concept of photons for the technology program, as
 we don't have time within the class to cover these topics. 
 For example, the students should understand the difference between
 a Solar System and a Galaxy, functionally, in appearance, and
 in scale.

<p>
 If you don't wish to go this route or don't have enough time
 to get the video mailed to you, I can attach a basic vocabulary/distance
 scales info sheet to an e-mail message to you, or you can find
 this document at the Friends of PMO web site.

<p>
 We will also be creating a video that demonstrates the use
 of FITSVIEW and AIP4WIN image analysis software.  This will
 be distributed as follow-up materials for students interested
 in pursuing a research project using digital images of the sky.

<p>
 SOLAR VIEWING:

<p>
 We now have a standard solar filter for the 6" telescope that
 I bring to classrooms, so if the sky is clear, there is potentially
 the opportunity to view sunspots.  We can set up the telescope
 outside before or after class or during lunch or recess.  This
 is not an H-alpha filter like we have at Pine Mountain that
 shows the solar prominences, but the standard filter still offers
 very interesting views of the solar "surface" features.  Queing
 up to view through the telescope takes time, so this usually
 doesn't work well during a class period as too many students
 are left idle, but is certainly suitable as a supplemental before/after
 class/school activity.

<p>REQUESTS FOR SKY VIEWING IN EVENING:

<p>
 Occasionally schools request an evening sky observing program
 in conjunction with the classroom outreach.  This may be feasible,
 working with your local Astronomy Club/Astronomical Society,
 or with any other local people who can bring large telescopes.
  We can set up the portable CCD Camera on a table outside, and
 students have a great time taking actual images of some of the
 larger objects in the sky, such as galaxies, star clusters,
 and nebulas.  We can discuss the arrangements for each request
 specifically, as resources vary considerably around the State.

<p>VIRTUAL REALITY (VR) Sun-Earth-Moon (SEM) project:

<p>
 Oregon Research Institute (ORI), in Eugene, has created a VR
 program where the user can "fly" his/her craft around, above,
 and below the Sun, Earth, and Moon (other planets may be added
 later).  The goal is for the user to conceptualize the motions,
 orientations, and views of these objects by being able to gain
 a wide variety of physical perspectives not normally available.
  Explorations include phases of the Moon and the orbits and
 periods of the Earth and Moon and their relationships to the
 position of the Sun.  This program, called SEM, is funded by
 the Federal Department of Education.  ORI Prime Investigator,
 Dr. Dean Inman, wrote the grant as a program designed to help
 Orthopedically Impaired (OI) students do science labs that they
 ordinarily would not be able to access.
 When I saw the software
 in early Summer, 2002, I was immediately struck that non-OI
 students should also be able to put these explorations to good
 use, and also noted that the software serves to illustrate many
 of the ODE's Earth-in-Space benchmarks.  
 I am now working
 with ORI to develop teacher and student materials for use of
 the SEM program, and will be introducing SEM in many of my outreach
 classes.  Dr. Inman and I will be looking for teachers who are
 interested in collaborating to investigate the efficacy of SEM,
 comparing how students learn with conventional strategies versus
 SEM, for both OI and regular students.  
 The software is free
 and is available either as a download off the web from http://www.ori.org/%7Evr/projects/vrscience/sem/index.html
 or from a CD-ROM that ORI can send you.   Fed Ed has also funded
 availability of high video performance computers from ORI for
 classrooms wishing to participate.  Please contact me if you
 are interested in participating, whether or not you have OI
 students. 

<p>RESEARCH PROJECTS:

<p>Inquiry-based RESEARCH PROJECTS for ALL GRADE LEVELS:
 Digital
 data can be used by students of all ages.  Here are some suggested
 projects that we can assist you to implement in your classroom.
  Depending on student academic levels, you could use/adapt several
 projects at a wide variety of grade levels.
 The projects can
 begin as inquiries after viewing some initial digital images
 of the sky (or viewing the real sky for that matter!)  If you
 come up with your own project, we can assist you with data and
 data analysis software.  We can demonstrate a basic project
 listed below during outreach and can then walk your students
 through the project in your computer lab.

<p>a. How many stars (how many galaxies)?
 Starting from a rudimentary
 counting exercise, students can explore images from various
 areas of the sky and images taken with a variety of exposure
 times.  Questions can be generated concerning distribution of
 objects, types of objects, and how much of what's out there
 we are really able to see, why and why not.  This is a very
 open-ended project that can be a real eye-opener to the vastness
 of space and the nature of how science is done and is very suitable
 for lower elementary grade levels.

<p>b. Do any objects shift position in the sky?
 This involves astrometric
 (positional) measurements, over a period of time.  Starting
 by "blinking" (comparing) images of the same area of sky over
 one or more nights, students can search for objects that shift
 relative position and then attempt to explain the shift observed.
  Students can derive the basic relationship between distance
 and parallactic shift and thus sort out Solar System objects
 versus Galactic objects, discover asteroids, and can begin to
 sort out the various planets at various distances and approximate
 the orbital radii.
 See the astrometric project, initiated by
 Silverton High School Teacher, Ray Kaser, described as the computer
 lab option in the Contents of Outreach Sessions section above.
 

<p>
 Another astrometric project involves the search for asteroids.
  This is an authentic research project with potentially very
 useful results (saving Earth!).  Students can request data or
 can scan archived data.  Best done with Richard Berry's AIP4WIN
 image analysis software, which when combined with a digital
 database, will allow the user to accurately determine coordinates
 of any candidates.  Data can then be compared with list of known
 objects compiled by Lowell Observatory, and if object is truly
 a new discovery, the discoverer may participate in the naming
 of the object.

<p>c. Why are some objects brighter than others?
 This involves
 photometric (brightness) measurements and leads to measurement
 of distances, temperatures, sizes, and brings up issues of instrument
 calibration.  At the basic level, students can intuitively conceptualize
 the relationships and can begin to characterize and classify
 objects in the sky.  
 We have archived sets of data of stars
 of several constellations, which can be measured for relative
 brightnesses.
 At more advanced levels, we can furnish images
 filtered in various colors (BVR) which would lead to measurement
 of temperature from the Planck Blackbody Curve and ultimately
 to construction of an H-R diagram and determining stellar age.

<p>REQUEST or DOWNLOAD DATA (IMAGES of the SKY):

<p>
 Archived data can be "FTPd" (we like WS_FTP software to do
 this) or "Timbuktud" (Timbuktu software from www.netopia.com)
 from IP 128.223.164.30.
 Contact Rick (rkang@efn.org) for user
 name/password.
 Also contact Rick if you want to acquire new
 data either from our COWCAM (1/2 degree FOV, BVR filters available,
 1Kx1K
 pixel CCD, 5 Meg FITS format images) or from our PIGGY
 (1 degree FOV, no filters, 242x375 pixel CCD, 300 KB FITS format
 images), we may be able so set up remote imaging sessions for
 you.
 We encourage you to select suitable targets and to furnish
 us with the identity, RA/DEC, and desired integration time and
 filters for your targets.  We can provide an initial digital
 sky tour if you wish.
 There is a $20 charge to set up a remote
 imaging session, and you will need to have Timbuktu software
 (from http://www.netopia.com) running on your computer.  There
 may be local firewall issues to resolve.

<p>HOW TO BRING YOUR CLASS TO PINE MOUNTAIN OBSERVATORY:

<p>DETAILS FOR OBSERVATORY TOURS:
 Please make advance reservation
 with Mark Dunaway, markpmo@oregon.uoregon.edu or 541-382-8331
 if you are planning to bring your class (or any group larger
 than 10 people) during regular tour season
 (Fri-Sat evenings
 Memorial Day weekend through September, or during
 the off season).

 We are now closed due to winter weather, but come March or April
 if the
 snows don&#8217;t make the road impassable, you may
 be able to bring your group
 to PMO if Mark can fit you in&#8230;dark
 moon weekends fill quickly).
   
 Program starts at dusk, check
 with Mark for exact times as may change as darkness falls later
 or ealier.  Also check with Mark on rates, we&#8217;ve had to
 increase our group rates as we&#8217;ve had to find funding
 for staff to drive up.  We&#8217;re trying to hold regular Fri-Sat
 summertime drop in rates to $3.00/visitor.   Dress warmly (can
 easily get below freezing at the 6500 foot elevation!) and bring
 a small flashlight covered with red cellophane or a brown paper
 bag (to protect everyone's night vision).  We furnish star charts.
  You can stay up with us all night, weather permitting.  Check
 the web site for Quick Cam views of the weather during daylight
 before you come up.  There is a Forest Service campground just
 across the parking lot from the Observatory, first come, first
 served, no reservations, no fees.  Primitive campground, you
 need to bring water.  
 Some schools have made arrangements
 with teachers at local Bend
 schools to use their gym to camp
 out in.
 Try to pick a non-Full Moon night (moon is very bright
 and washes out fainter objects).
 For further details, see the
 How to Visit PMO link and/or call 541-382-8331.
   OBSERVATORY
 TELESCOPE STATUS:
 15" Telescope now has digital setting circles,
 making finding objects much easier.
 24" Telescope has minor
 tracking problems in some positions, we continue to work on
 this, but telescope and PIGGY CCD are basically in service.

 32" Telescope continues to be available for limited collection
 of research data with the COWCAM, including images filtered
 with B, V, or R filters.  Contact Rick with your initial proposal,
 I'll put you in touch with Professor Bothun to work out the
 details.
 Solar Viewing: We now have an H-alpha solar filter
 for use on our portable 8" telescope, that allows visitors during
 daytime to view the huge prominences blasted out by the Sun.
  Normally we have this telescope set up outside the 24" dome
 on Saturday afternoons, 2-5 PM during the regular Visitors'
 Season.
