<p>Sifting and Sorting Through the 4-Blocks Literacy Modelby Cheryl
 M. SigmonThe Media Center as the Hub of Four Blocks

<p> An inquiry came recently from Sylvia Hix, a Library Media Specialist
 at Lakeview Elementary in Nashville, Tennessee. Sylvia and a
 teacher in her school were busy writing a grant to support some
 training in Four Blocks, and she wanted me to share with her
 how---and if---I felt that a media specialist could be helpful
 and involved in the school's implementation of the Four blocks
 framework. Sylvia and I both thought that our discussion might
 be useful to others. 

<p>Yes, media specialists can be critical to the success of 4-Blocks
 in a school. Of course, teachers can be successful in spite
 of that lack of support from the librarian/media specialist,
 but those teachers really have to be super-motivated and super-informed.
 When the partnership is strong between teachers and the media
 specialist, implementation can be so much easier and so much
 more successful. 

<p>Below are some ways that media specialists can help: 

<l> Media specialists can keep teachers updated on good read-aloud
 printed material for their SSR Block. Using a few minutes during
 each faculty meeting would be a great way to model read-aloud
 techniques and to give advice about titles that would be of
 interest to kids at different grade levels.

<l> On some days, librarians can actually do the read-aloud portion
 of the block for classes that are using the library for SSR
 Block on a rotating basis. The kids then select books from throughout
 the library with the help of the teacher and the librarian.
 Learning to pick appropriate books is an important skill for
 students and is usually acquired with help from one of these
 knowledgeable adults.

<l> Librarians can be instrumental in helping teachers make decisions
 about books that would be popular and appropriate to include
 in the students' book baskets during SSR Block. In some schools
 that don't have generous classroom libraries, the librarians
 actually help teachers stock the individual book baskets. Stocking
 the baskets is a difficult task as we look for a variety of
 ranges: readability levels, topics, genres, and authors.

<l> Librarians can help with selections that can be used for the
 grade-level and easier materials during Guided Reading. Multiple
 copies of texts are almost always used for Guided Reading Block.
 Librarians can make recommendations about appropriate texts
 and in some cases might even store multiple copies from which
 teachers can make their selections. It's of little use for an
 individual teacher to have a huge collection of multiple texts
 when these can be stored in the library and made available to
 more teachers. The below grade level texts are sometimes difficult
 for teachers to access.

<l> Librarians can furnish appropriate texts for Words Block where
 teachers are always on the lookout for rhyming texts or those
 books that allow them to explore the word level of reading.

<l> Librarians can encourage teachers to use certain books for their
 modeling during Writing Block where authors use techniques,
 styles or offer exemplars of good Standard English that would
 help students grow in their own writing.

<l> The librarian can set aside space for student publications from
 various classrooms that are publishing during their Writing
 Block. Some librarians may want to actually put a bar code on
 the student publications and find prime display space for them.
 This would really motivate students to improve their writing!
 Students writing is exponentially better when they know that
 they have a real audience---and especially when that audience
 is their peers!

<l> The librarian may want to host a monthly (or whatever time period
 seems reasonable given all the tasks they do!) Authors' Tea
 for students who have published at certain grade levels or for
 representatives from each classroom. This again would keep those
 kids writing! Tables might even be set up for autographing.

<l> The librarian could be the person who helps the adults in the
 school establish a reading habit for themselves. Often, as we
 encourage students to acquire good reading habits we don't see
 that we are their best models for lifetime reading. We may use
 the time in school to help establish students' reading habits,
 but we hope and expect that there will be transfer outside of
 the school. We may never be able to convince kids of this if
 we don't see ourselves as readers. The librarian might be the
 person who includes adult books (not the X-rated ones---these
 are books for adults!) in the faculty newsletter. Or, perhaps
 the librarian starts a book club for faculty members who want
 to gather once a week or once a month to discuss a book they
 all agree to read. We could simulate Oprah's book clubs where
 we chat about the book and have snacks or dinner together. What
 fun! And, the students would know about it, too! They would
 know that we ARE readers---we practice what we preach!

<l> The librarian can serve as the hub for 4-Blocks growth in the
 school not only by furnishing books as stated above, but also
 by keeping the momentum going---displaying posters of students'
 work, displaying teachers' work, posting ideas for teachers
 to try in their 4-Blocks delivery, inviting teachers and students
 to review books and write advertisements for them, displaying
 a Word Wall, etc.

<p>Yes! The librarian can be instrumental in keeping 4-Blocks alive
 and well in a school. There are many additional ways that you
 could use your time to support tremendous changes in teaching
 and learning in your school. I hope that these few ideas will
 spark your creativity as you support Four Blocks implementation!
 ANNOUNCEMENT: My newest book, Modifying Four-Blocks at the Upper
 Grades (2001, Carson-Dellosa) is now out! I'm glad to have the
 writing of this one behind me, and I hope it'll be helpful to
 teachers at grades 4-8 and, perhaps, those at 3rd grade who
 have more advanced students. Let me know what you think after
 you've had a chance to read it. There are some great reproducibles
 in the back on the book!

<p> Notice For Grant Writers: If you're writing grants and need
 assistance with implementation in your schools and districts,
 I'm willing to write letters of intent/commitment to support
 your training and implementation. I've furnished quite a few
 of these lately. I certainly want you to get good training and
 I'll be sure that you do! Just email or call if you need a letter.
 I know that most of your grants are due soon. Training Opportunities:

<p>Below are seminars (some 1 day and some 2 day ones) that I have
 coming up in the future. Please know that I have a small group
 of really excellent folks who work along with me, too. We do
 site-based work in schools and districts at your request. For
 their services, you can simply call 843-549-2684 and speak with
 Cathy Bell or visit her website at www.ergsc.com. We offer various
 types of staff development: classroom demonstrations, on-site
 presentations, classroom observations and feedback, and exploring
 4-Blocks in more depth, among other offerings.

<p>**Seminar Note: If you attend a seminar titled, Introduction
 to Four Blocks, Grades 4-6, please know that "Introduction"
 at upper grades still means that basics will be covered---not
 just the adaptations. For upper grade teachers who've had no
 Four Blocks training, they need---and appreciate---those basics.
 Personal Journal:

<p>Sad news to share with those of you who have written to me since
 Leadership Conference about my critically ill mother-in-law:
 Freida died on March 17th. She was a wonderful, wonderful woman
 whom we'll miss terribly. Thanks for your kind thoughts and
 prayers that have sustained us throughout this difficult time.
 

<p>Sylvia, Eve, and I had another day with the good folks in New
 Jersey. (We couldn't wait to get in that Sunday night to eat
 at Mastori's again!) Thanks again to Suzanne Phillips for taking
 care of travel details and for hosting my day! 

<p>I loved my quick visit to Albuquerque and Phoenix. What a beautiful
 part of the country! Thanks to "mailring buddy" Susan Nixon
 for whisking me to the airport just in time for my flight all
 the way back across the country that evening! Don't know what
 I'd do without a little help from my friends! 

<p>I had a great group of folks in Houston this week who were patient
 with me while I delivered my message with one of the worst colds
 I've ever had! They were very kind. Many thanks! It's hard to
 be on the road when you're sick. I took my cold on to another
 group in San Antonio today. Hope I didn't leave any cold germs
 behind as mementos! It was great to find that 4-Blocks is spreading
 in San Antonio. I've done a good bit of work there over the
 past two to three years through Region 20. The data coming out
 of that area sounds phenomenal! They shared very kind words
 about the new upper grades book that excited me! 

<p>Hope everyone's enjoying Spring Break or that you're now returning
 to your schools renewed and re-energized!
