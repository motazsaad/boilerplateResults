<p> Everyone is unique. Thus, in a safe environment, I try to understand
 your particular dilemma and see the world through your eyes.
 My desire is to empower you to manifest your soul's fullest
 expression and achieve your goals in work, relationships and
 health. I treat marital or career problems, anxiety, depression,
 trauma, grief, chronic pain and illness. I work with those affected
 by abuse and addiction, and am familiar with 12-step Programs.
 Formerly a lawyer, I understand work pressures, and aid clients
 with career stress, goals, and transitions. I mediated divorces
 and resolved custody disputes in Conciliation Court.

<p>
 I try to adapt each session to your special needs. Utilizing
 dynamic dialogue and cognitive behavioral therapy, clients gain
 self-acceptance and understanding, catalysts for change. Sometimes
 I also use dream interpretation, visualization, gestalt, meditation
 and hypnosis. With chronic pain, I teach breath, touch and sound
 techniques to alleviate pain.

<p>
 In addition to my extensive training, I have years of experience
 related to spirituality and healing, and have helped many clients
 through trauma, spiritual and relationship crises, loss and
 illness. "
