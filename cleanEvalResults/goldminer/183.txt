<h>Term "Wife Beater" Gains Acceptance

<p>I have never liked calling white t-shirts "wife beaters" for
 obvious reasons. I've heard too many teenaged boys use the term,
 and think that it's cool. Unfortunately, Ms. Musings reports
 that the word has been accepted into the Oxford English Dictionary.
 Here is what Alison Ward of the Star Telegraph has to say about
 it:

<p>For at least three decades, the controversial term has been used
 to describe the ribbed tank top made famous by violent movie
 stereotypes and the Fox show Cops. Men who beat their wives,
 the thinking goes, like to spend their spare time drinking beer
 in thin white undershirts. 

<p>The shirt has traveled far beyond its blue-collar roots; celebs
 have made it sexy. Paris Hilton wears hers with itty-bitty skirts.
 It's hard to spot Eminem or Kevin Federline (Britney Spears'
 husband) without one. "Most nights I end up wearing a wife-beater
 T-shirt and boxers," Jessica Alba told the leering men's mag
 Maxim.

<p>Newspapers have been claiming since 2003 that "wife-beater's"
 inclusion in the OED is imminent. But in its February issue,
 GQ -- a magazine that oughta know its men's fashion terms --
 swears the word will be added next month in the OED's quarterly
 online update.

<p>Jesse Sheidlower, the OED's North American editor at large, confirms
 this. Well, sort of.

<p>"It's very likely that this is going to appear," he says.

<p>Sheidlower says the dictionary accepts about 250 new words per
 quarter. The third printed edition of the mammoth OED won't
 be published for several more years, but the online version
 -- available by subscription -- serves as an official, ever-expanding
 substitute in the meantime.

<p>So what makes "wife-beater" a contender? "If something is really
 common and relatively widespread, it's likely to go in," Sheidlower
 says.

<h>Comments

<p>I used to know a guy who used to call handlebar mustaches "wife
 beater mustaches". And it was odd because after I heard him
 say that, I actually saw 2 tv shows about men who abused their
 spouses - and both had handlebar mustaches. (One show was "Walker
 Texas Ranger", of course. haha. This was years ago, mind you.)

<p>What I want to know, is yeah - why would someone proudly want
 to wear something called "wife beater"? Seems to me people who
 like those t-shirts (or those mustaches for that matter) should
 vehemently object to the term.

<p>I first heard the word "wife-beater" used in reference to white
 undershirts/tank tops when I was working at a gap outlet store
 and some guy came in asking if we had "wife-beaters."

<p>I gave him a confused look and politely asked him to repeat the
 question because I was sure I had misheard him. Once he said
 it again and I knew I heard correctly I just gaped at him...and
 pretended to misunderstand what he was asking for when he pointed
 to his own white undershirt.

<p>It wasn't until his girlfriend stepped in and specifically said
 "white tank tops" that I politely said "no, we don't carry any
 mens tank tops in the winter."

<p>Trish: Sorry about the multiple ping on the trackback. Would
 appreciate your comments at my post on the commercial angle
 of this guy who sells these tee shirts with the logos Wife beater
 on them. If your regular readers are offended by this guy (and
 I suspect they will be), comments can be addressed to:
 bruised@wife-beaters.com

<p>Thanks for the email link to the wifebeaters site. I've seen
 that site before, and it's nauseating. And it's okay that you
 pinged me a few times. Typepad burped on me a little while ago,
 and I think that's probably why your trackbacks came up more
 than once.

<p>I was talkinga bout this with a friend... And the people we've
 known who've used the term have used it with disdainful irony.
 In that they would never wear an UNDER shirt in a public setting.

<p>Of course I think that's how they got the term, because on those
 cop shows, they show up at the people's private residences when
 there's a domestic violence incident.

<p>Though I still don't know why someone would wear a white undershirt
 to the mall to go shopping at The Gap. LOL.
 Why not just go
 there in your boxers already? How 'bout in just a bra.
 ick.
