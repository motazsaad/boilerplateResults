<p>This document outlines the basic principles underlying the proper
 use of the optical radiation safety calculator. It is designed
 for assessing situations in which the eye is illuminated, either
 to provide a stimulus or to illuminate it for photography, videography
 or direct observation. The optical radiation safety calculator
 performs calculations for radiation at visible wavelengths (400-700
 nm), and near infrared (700-1400 nm). 

<p>The basic principles of radiometry can be found elsewhere (link
 to W&amp;S ref), but will be presented here in brief. Measurements
 can be made either in terms of radiometric units, which correspond
 to raw energy or power, or photometric units, which are corrected
 for visibility. When dealing with safety issues, we are primarily
 concerned with radiometric measures; the same principles apply
 to photometric measurements, however, so when we use a radiometric
 term, the corresponding photometric term will be listed in parentheses.
 

<p>The basic radiometric (photometric) measurements are irradiance
 (illuminance) and radiance (luminance). Irradiance describes
 the total power falling on a surface (such as the surface of
 a detector, or a tissue surface in the eye). The units of irradiance
 are expressed in power per unit area, typically Watts per centimeter
 squared (W/cm&#178;). 

<p>When a surface is irradiated with a certain amount of power,
 the energy comes from a source. Most sources are distributed
 in space, that is, they have some finite size. (This size approaches
 zero for a perfectly collimated beam, such as might be emitted
 by a laser.) The radiance of a source is simply the irradiance
 it produces, divided by the size of the source, where the size
 is expressed as the solid angle (in steradians) subtended by
 the source from the point at which the measurement is made.
 A little reflection should make it clear that the radiance of
 a source is independent of the distance at which the measurement
 is made: if we double the distance from the source, the irradiance
 will decrease by a factor of 4 (inverse square law); but the
 apparent size of the source will also decrease by a factor of
 4, and the two factors cancel out. 

<p>2. Types of ocular exposure

<p>For considerations of eye safety, there are two principle areas
 of concern: the first is corneal irradiance. When optical radiation
 (particularly infrared) strikes the cornea, it can heat and
 dry it, causing damage to the tissue. (Infrared radiation can
 also cause damage to soft contact lenses at levels that are
 considered safe for eye exposure, but to my knowledge there
 is no published data on this!) 

<p>The second area of concern is retinal irradiation. Damage to
 the retina can cause areas of local blindness ("scotomas").
 The calculation of retinal irradiance is fairly straightforward:
 the total amount of power entering the eye can be calculated
 as the product of the corneal irradiance times the effective
 pupil area. The illuminated area of retina will be an image
 of the source, subtending the same angle from the posterior
 nodal point as the source does from the anterior nodal point.
 Therefore, the retinal area is simply the product of the solid
 angle subtended by the source (in steradians) and the posterior
 nodal distance of the eye. 

<p>To convert retinal irradiance to radiance, we need to divide
 by the source solid angle; but at the retina, the apparent source
 is the exit pupil of the eye, so this is the relevant measure.
 It can be shown by a little algebra that this is identically
 equal to the original source radiance! 

<p>For the calculations we assume that the source is uniform. This
 assumption may be violated for real sources; for example, a
 lamp filament will have "hot spots" where the local radiance
 is higher than the average radiance. In these situations, it
 is best to use a diffuser to homogenize the source image. Diffractive
 optical elements capable of diffusing a beam within a narrow
 angular range (such as those manufactured by Physical Optics
 Corporation) are ideal for this application. 

<p>3. Using the program

<p>Detector diameter.
A circular detector area is assumed. For a
 circular detector, simply enter the diameter in millimeters
 of the active surface. For a non-circular detector, calculate
 the area (in mm&#178), then divide by pi (3.14159), take the
 square root of the result and multiply by 2 to obtain the equivalent
 diameter. 

<p>Wavelength
A monochromatic or narrow band source is assumed.
 For a broadband infrared source, the value here is not too critical,
 because the calculations are not too wavelength dependent. To
 be conservative, use a value of xxx nm. Broadband visible sources
 are more problematic, because the "blue light hazard" function
 has a sharp peak at 4xx nm. 

<p>Source dimensions at pupil
These parameters are most relevant
 for setups (such as Maxwellian view optical systems) where the
 source is imaged in the pupil by a system of one or more lenses.
 In the case where the source image is smaller than the natural
 pupil (assumed to be 7 mm), the source area is used for the
 effective pupil area. For cases where the entire eye/face is
 illuminated directly by a source, the values here do not really
 matter, as long as they are larger than 7mm. 

<p>Apparent size and distance of the source
For free viewing of
 a source, simply enter the actual size and distance (in millimeters).
 For Maxwellian view, where the final lens appears uniformly
 filled with light, use the diameter and distance of the lens.
 

<p>Detector power
Enter the power measurement in microwatts. 

<p> 4. Glossary

<p>Effective pupil area: The area of the pupil through which light
 passes. Under free viewing conditions, this is usually just
 the area of the natural pupil. It can be smaller than the natural
 pupil under special conditions, such as viewing through a small
 artificial pupil, or when using an instrument with a small exit
 pupil such as a Maxwellian view optical system.
