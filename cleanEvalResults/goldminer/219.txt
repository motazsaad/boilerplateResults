<h>Hey, Look at This

<h>05/29/2005

<h>Keep your powder dry and your wipes wet 

<p>Most of you will laugh that I even bother to post about this.

<p>Yesterday we were taking Charlie for a ride -- ostensibly to
 the cheese-and-chocolate outlet by way of the gas station that
 for no good reason appears to charge 20 cents a gallon less
 than anywhere else in the state. He's been a bit fussy since
 getting stabbed three times in the leg for his six-month birthday,
 and we thought it might calm him. (As a science geek, I also
 pointed out that if he started crying really loud we could just
 run the car up to mach 1 and outrun the soundwaves.)

<p>Of course, halfway through the trip Charlie went from twisting
 his head around to look forward at me with big appealing eyes
 to calling out for attention to calling out rather more urgently
 for food. No problem, we just waited him out for a few miles
 and pulled into the first available parking lot, at a disused
 carwash, and I got the bottle out of his carefully prestocked
 bag. He fit neatly across my lap as he ate, only occasionally
 kicking his carseat or thumping his head against the passenger
 door.

<p>Cue one gastrocolic reflex. Also no problem -- the bag has long
 been stocked with diapers -- in his current size yet -- and
 moist wipes. Which were after a month or so of no in-car events
 about as moist as a civil-defense cracker from 1955. 

<p>We are gifted improvisers, and Charlie did just fine being changed
 and mostly cleaned under the shelter of a liftgate and an open
 carwash booth. Whoever empties the dumpster at the apartments
 across the way, my thanks and apologies.

<p>So now we know to rotate our stock of moist wipes, and all the
 more-experienced folks out there are shaking their heads at
 the exponentially more messy hijinks that await us. But every
 day we do something new with Charlie without utterly screwing
 up I like to imagine at least a tiny glow of accomplishment,
 and that was yesterday's.

<p>so these are the adventures my partner and i have to look forward
 too! cant wait i say bring it on it may break up a boring trip
 to good knows where or it could destroy a trip to somewhere
 good like with all you take the good with the bad and get on
 with life and finding a way to doo all along with bub.

 its about my male view
 of our pregnancy

<p>I have made very few comments on your blog, but I've been reading
 for quite a while. 

<p>I like to think that parenthood is a constant steam of improvisation.
 My final verdict: who gives a shit. that is all (um... i have
 a PhD in developmental neuroscience, and I say this in full
 knowledge of all the current research on brain development).
 But... you know your kid, and that's what matters.

<p>Heck, we've gotten over a YEAR on the wipes-in-a-Ziploc for moisture
 retention! We also keep two small grocery bags in with the diaper
 stuff: one for poopy nappy disposal and one for poopy onsie/pants.
 ALWAYS having an extra change of clothes in the bag goes without
 saying...live and learn!

<p>Hey necessity is the mother of invention, right? Or maybe it's
 the mother of Charlie. ;-) Good for you guys, glad it turned
 out ok. And thanks for the tip, I admit I wouldn't have known
 either. Making a mental note now.

<p>I've seen you linked all over the place, and had to surf on over.
 I'm creating a list of "Blogs Across America" and "Blogs Across
 the World." I'd love to include yours. I'm finding women with
 varying posts and interests (thereby, making MY blog yet more
 interesting!).

<p>If you're interested, shoot me an email and let me know either
 the country you reside, or the state. I completely understand
 if you choose not to disclose this info.

<p>I also encourage others to email with their own blogs, or those
 of others. I'm trying to really spread things around and get
 a varied list.

<p>dry wipies can be re-moistened with water, if you have any--works
 fine.

<p>I remember one very interesting diaper explosion in the stroller.
 The experience of casually inquiring about the restroom, praying
 that the shopowner doesn't glance down at the child rolling
 about in her liquid excreta, does not fade appreciably even
 after seven years. I'm telling you, no amount of moist wipes
 covers that one.

<p>I second the ziploc bag suggestion (or is third by now?). Our
 youngest has been diaper free for just over 2 years now, and
 we haven't used wipes in that long. We were going to an event
 on Sat. that required the application of sunscreen, but I wanted
 to wait until we were just about there before I put in on the
 kids. I thought I remembered having wipes in the bathroom, but
 I thought for sure they'd be bone dry. Nope, they were fine,
 in a ziploc bag. They were actually dripping with that special
 wipes moistness.

<p>COSTCO WIPES. I don't know if you live anywhere where there is
 a Costco, but their wipes are by far the best, and cheapest
 out there. They are so good, and they don't smell, which is
 great for wiping my nose when I need to, or cleaning off the
 McDonalds goo before I get discovered. I can keep them in the
 hot car for months, and they are still perfectly moist. 

<p>Okay, I love the cat idea. Our dog has eaten entire poopy diapers
 before, dug them out of the trash, so I know it can be done.

<p>But Liz is right, put the wipes in a ziploc baggie and they'll
 keep forever. We found a bag in the pocket of a tote last used
 a year ago, and they were fine. Rather freaky, that, actually.

<p>Oh, and on Saturday night, we took the kids to a friend's house
 for dinner. Wilder stubbornly refuses to poop in the potty,
 Calder foolishly left Wilder in a pull-up all afternoon, and
 we discovered that Wilder had filled his pants when we pulled
 into the friends' driveway. Oops--no diaper bag in sight. Okay,
 we borrow the friends' wipes (er, use them up--not giving 'em
 back, after all) and Wilder goes commando. Then he pours his
 water all over his lap at dinner--oops, no dry change of clothes,
 because no bag. Okay, we borrow clothes (including underpants,
 because the friends don't realize Wilder's going free-range
 and figure he has soaked undies) and everything is fine.

<p>But it's been four years, and we're STILL having these brain-cramp
 oversights? Yeesh.

<p>Honey, you all did swimmingly. A good friend of mine had a baby
 diaper blowout so bad, she tossed all the clothes in the trash
 can and bought new ones! No lie. That's what they make SuperWalmart
 for.

<p>Why do they make wipe boxes that don't retain the moisture? This
 looks like a job for Tupperware.

<p>We once had a diaper blowout incident during the appetizer course
 in a restaurant while vacationing in Florida. Since we were
 ONLY going out to dinner and wouldn't be gone too long, we didn't
 bother to pack a change of clothes. Bad move. I had to throw
 the clothes in the bathroom trash can (yes, it was THAT bad)
 and ended up buying a resaturant t-shirt in the smallest size
 they had, which was a 4T. Did I mention that the blowout baby
 was 7 months old? The t-shirt came down to the top of his feet.
 The poor kid finished out the evening looking like he was the
 poster child for a trailor park christening.

<p>After that, I packed three changes of clothes even if I was only
 carrying him out to the mailbox at the end of the driveway.

<p>Incidentally, the Huggies wipe boxes retain moisture better than
 the Pampers ones......I'm comparing the non pop-up variety of
 boxes, which I'm not even sure Pampers makes anymore. Any pop-up
 wipe variety is more susceptible to drying since there are multiple
 openings on the box, and it's easy to shut the box with some
 wipe caught in the edge, leaving an air space.....but no matter,
 Zip-locs do solve the problem.

<p>I can always tell when my husband has changed a diaper, because
 he forgets to close the lid on the wet wipes box. There are
 things you expect to argue about -- money, sex, the remote control...
 I never thought we'd be arguing about wet wipes.

<p>Ziplocs are also great for disposing of radioactive diapers.
 If you're staying in a hotel, for example, you really don't
 want to come back to that smell.

<p>The plastic baggie trick works very well, as does remoistening
 with water. But I am lazy and I just buy the Huggies travel
 wipes in their own hard plastic case. As long as you shut it
 correctly, the wipes stay moist for a very long time. You can
 just refill the wipes case with whatever brand of wipes you
 normally use. The case holds about 25 wipes.

<p>My worst blowout story happened while we were negotiating to
 buy my car. We didn't think we would actually buy a car that
 day, and so I only had one back-up outfit with me. As usual
 when you buy a new car, we were in the dealership for 10 years.
 About an hour into our negotiations, Madeline spit up all over
 herself and me, so I changed her and spot-cleaned my t-shirt
 with those Huggies wipes. Very soon thereafter, she had the
 worst blowout of her life while being held up against that same
 t-shirt. I had to 1) throw-out the diaper and the one-piece
 outfit she as wearing in the dealership ladies room, 2) rinse
 off the vomit splattered outfit I had just changed her out of
 in the sink, 3)dress her in said wet and vomit stained outfit,
 4)take off my own poop and vomit stained shirt and wash it in
 the sink (I highly reccommend adding some Shout Wipes to your
 diaper bag), and 5)go out into the dealership in my wet t-shirt
 to tell my husband I didn't care what he had to agree to in
 order for us to leave immediately. 

<p>Everyone knows that you can tell a kid's birth order by the size
 of the diaper bag: full suitcase = firstborn; knapsack or tidy
 shoulder-bag = secondborn; one disposable diaper stuck in pocket
 of Mom's purse = everyone from there on.

<p>I pushed the limits of those time-tested rules with one of my
 kids. Set out for a walk around the neighbourhood with NO diaper
 bag of any kind and a CLOTH-DIAPERED kid in the stroller. One
 thing led to another and I found myself on foot much farther
 from home than I'd planned--over the river and a long walk from
 the next bridge. I went to the grocery story and bought a cheap
 pack of dishcloths, pinned them triumphantly in place on my
 child, tied filthy diaper and plastic pants securely in the
 grocery store's plastic bag, and booted it home in haste before
 he soaked through the nice new fabric. (Um humm, our grandmas
 didn't have plastic pants, can you imagine.) Thank god I had
 packed my wallet!! 

<p>I still have that 3-pack of dishcloths kicking around the house
 (well-washed and bleached, I assure you) and I smile fondly
 at the memory every time I use them to wipe up.
