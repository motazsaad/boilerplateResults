<p>NOTICE! 12/28/2001Back when Charity gave me permission to list
 her links, she had found the need to focus her attention at
 home, rather than on maintaining a website. Although I set out
 to repair the many links that had gone out of date, I find that
 life is intervening in way that makes it impossible for me to
 continue to update this Unit Studies page as well, at least
 at this time. My brother is now living with us while he fights
 brain cancer, and our attention is necessarily on his health,
 wellbeing and happiness. If you find that the unit studies you
 are interested in are out of date, or the links are broken,
 try copying the title of the unit and doing a search for it.
 You can also try searching for the term "unit study". You may
 be pleasantly surprised. Good luck in your endeavors!!

<p>Finding materials to use in setting up your daily curriculum
 can be quite a challenge. We are grateful to Charity Lovelace,
 of Hilltop Homeschool(no longer available after Sept 15,2000,
 but we can hope she finds time to share her extraordinary talents
 again), for putting together this long list of Unit Study sites,
 and kindly allowing us to copy and share it. Although it does
 not include any of her own, it is a wealth of good ones.

<p>
 Be sure to visit the Links listed in the green box at the left
 on this page, and Sassafrass Grove's MAIN HOMESCHOOLING PAGE
 for much more information, many more links and lots of support.
 

<p>Thank You for Visiting!

<p>If you find errors or broken links, please let us know via e-mail.
