<h>Internet Democracy Gone Bad

<p>We are all working in a more interconnected world, with unprecedented
 access to information and other people with skills. You might
 think that having a pool of thousands of new and skilled people
 working with you on a project would be a bonus. Unfortunately,
 the same accessibility that makes great people accessible also
 makes questionable people just as likely to contact you. The
 same democratic principles that make the Internet a great thing
 also mean that you may be democratically exposed to con artists
 and incompetent people claiming great skills.

<p>The following information may appear to be common sense, and
 most of these suggestions are the same things you might do if
 someone were applying in person to work with you at a business
 or on a project. Apply the same principles to working with people
 on the Internet that you would in &ldquo;real life.&rdquo;

<h>Beware of Lofty Claims

<p>Someone who claims great things should be able to prove it. If
 she teaches at an internationally renowned institution, she
 will give you equivalent material to back up the claim. Additionally,
 most institutions list their affiliations and employees on the
 Web. If you visit the institution Web site and she is nowhere
 to be found, something is probably wrong.

<p>If an applicant is really known for her work in a particular
 area, there is a high chance of finding corroborating evidence
 on the Web.

<h>Beware of Inconsistencies

<p>Someone who claims to be a teacher and a week later claims to
 be an Art Director is misrepresenting something. If he were
 both a teacher and Art Director, he would have presented that
 information to you in the first place. You want nothing to do
 with him. I have never found an exception in which someone &ldquo;accidentally&rdquo;
 forgot to mention all the important information.

<p>Look out for &ldquo;backtracking&rdquo; with information. If
 a potential partner or applicant claims to work somewhere, and
 upon being questioned changes the employer, something is wrong.
 After all, don&rsquo;t we all know who we work for? There is
 no example I can give in which someone legitimately misrepresented
 his current job, title, position, and employer.

<p>A potential contributor may profess to be many things, but he
 should be able to back it up. For example, if she claims to
 be a video camera operator and video editor, she should be able
 to give proof of both skills and not just one. Simply providing
 proof of camera work does not prove editing skills, and vice
 versa.

<p>Also beware of people who state &ldquo;I would like to&hellip;&rdquo;
 such as, &ldquo;I am a cameraman who would like to be involved
 in production.&rdquo; This person is telling you that while
 he may have video experience, he wants to be something else
 that he has no proven skills with. He will refrain from doing
 his proven work (video camera work) and will instead try to
 only do what he imagines as his &ldquo;proper&rdquo; position
 and title. What he is really saying is, &ldquo;I am a cameraman
 but don&rsquo;t want to do that anymore and I want to be a Producer
 even though I have no experience.&rdquo;

<h>Ask for References

<p>The same things that apply in the rest of world apply on the
 Internet. Someone with false claims will be unable to present
 corroborating references. Of course, it is also important to
 check the validity of references to make sure they are legitimate.

<p>If someone gives you a reference that is extremely impressive
 (example, Steve Jobs) then don&rsquo;t be impressed&hellip;yet.
 E-mail the person in the reference, no matter how important.
 If the reference in question, no matter how lofty, responds
 favorably, then you are in good shape. You might be surprised
 at how many times you will get a response of non-association
 and unfamiliarity.

<h>Writing

<p>If a potential partner isn&rsquo;t willing to adhere to the established
 principles of grammar and spelling, you shouldn&rsquo;t waste
 your time. No more than 10% of an article should need correction
 and/or editing, and that is being generous. The more you let
 partners get away with, the more work you and your competent
 staff will suffer by being forced to compensate.

<h>Language is Not a Problem

<p>Don&rsquo;t let anyone fool you with providing excuses like &ldquo;I
 didn&rsquo;t understand your request,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Forgive
 me, I do not speak well.&rdquo; If she can manage to express
 those sentiments, she can also understand everything else perfectly.
 While the Web language translation engines are far from perfect,
 they can usually give clear enough translation for most people.

<h>Pay Attention to Presentation

<p>Professionalism translates to e-mails just as much as it does
 with other media. If someone professing to be a designer doesn&rsquo;t
 present you with images and examples that indicates an understanding
 of line, shape, negative space, composition, type, and color,
 then he is not a professional designer.

<h>Beware of Forums &amp; Forum-presented Content

<p>A large number of people want their &ldquo;name in lights&rdquo;
 but are too lazy to present their materials properly. It is
 enough for them to have their artwork, their articles or other
 content posted in forums&mdash;because this gives them the attention
 they desire.

<p>Even decent articles and artwork are not best represented by
 a forum presentation. If someone proudly displays her work in
 that format, she is unlikely to understand the demands of a
 professional organization. These days it is too easy to set
 up a Web site (even for free) for anyone to use the excuse that
 her only option is displaying work in forums on another Web
 site.

<p>If the forum-presented work is exceptional, you can judge the
 work based upon the exact content but not on other abilities.
 Judge the work in the forum, and realize the person cannot show
 you examples of how she is competent to present her excellent
 works.

<p>Judging Web design, design, and presentation skills based on
 forums is impossible because forums are easily had. For example,
 someone who has set up a PHP Nuke forum Web site does not necessarily
 know Web design. Installing PHP Nuke or any equivalent forum
 technology is easy, and there are hundreds of free templates
 available to present the site well. A poorly presented PHP Nuke
 Web site demonstrates a lack of understanding or outright laziness
 about proper presentation, design, and merchandising. Having
 a PHP Nuke Web site means she installed PHP Nuke, but nothing
 more.

<p>As tempting as it may be, you should also avoid advertising for
 new contributors and staff on forums-based Web sites. If you
 advertise this way, you will only increase your work as you
 weed through the responses.

<h>Demand Original Files

<p>You might be surprised at the number of people who present work
 from others as their own. Anyone can copy images, 3D graphics,
 or other content from the millions of Web sites available. There
 is no way to check to see whether a person has stolen content
 from other sources without spending months searching the millions
 of Web sites worldwide.

<p>By demanding original works in original formats from the application
 used for creation, you can increase the chances that you are
 actually seeing work that represents the person in question.
 A designer who copied a graphic, photo, or other material from
 another Web site will have no supporting material.

<h>Listen to Your Gut Reaction

<p>&ldquo;Listening to your gut&rdquo; sums up everything above.
 Many times when people are in need of services, they have a
 tendency to look for what they want rather than what is actually
 being presented. Be as objective as possible in your determinations
 and your communications with people over the Web.

<p>Do not worry about having to turn away people you feel are questionable.
 The people who truly offer something will shine though the mire.
 You may get thousands of e-mails and only end up with a half-dozen
 people to work with, but at least the ones you pick are more
 likely to come through.

<p>Remember the scene from Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade: &ldquo;He
 chose poorly.&rdquo; By not paying attention to what is in front
 of you and instead picking what you envision, you will most
 likely &ldquo;choose poorly&rdquo; and destroy everything you
 intended to create.
