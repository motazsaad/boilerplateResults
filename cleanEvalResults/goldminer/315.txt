<l>UNION GIVES STRIKE NOTICE AFTER COMPANY REFUSES "WRITTEN RECOMMENDATIONS"
 ASKS MEDIATOR TO BOOK OUT 

<l>April 25, 1997 

<l>At the Labour Relations Board last Monday the Union, after a
 number of hours of discussion, offered Starbucks "a way out"
 of both the Distribution Centre crisis that they created and
 the impasse in collective bargaining. We proposed the following:
 

<l>- three days of negotiations with the assistance of both the
 present mediator, Debbie Apps and the Associate Chair of Mediation,
 Brian Foley. The Company also had to come to the table with
 a WAGE OFFER. Following these negotiations we proposed that
 the mediators make written recommendations. Under the process
 of written recommendations both sides are obligated to take
 a vote on the principals: 

<l>i.e. Starbucks Howard Shultz or his designate 

<l>CAW Local 3000 Starbucks employees represented by the Union 

<l>Starbucks refused and so the Union now has asked the Mediator
 to "book out" and we have served seventy-two hours strike notice.
 As we are under Section 55 proceedings the Associate Chair of
 Mediation determines when the Parties are in a legal position
 to exercise their mandate. In his letter to the Parties, Mr.
 Foley states that the strike/lockout option will be legal "just
 after May 14th". This is not uncommon if written recommendations
 are rejected by one side as an option. Earlier today I concluded
 a first collective agreement a couple of hours before the notice
 had legal effect. This was at Link Technologies in Delta. Oh,
 by the way, that Company was threatening to close its doors
 too but the membership held firm - 125 workers were involved.
 

<l>At last Wednesday's meeting it was nice to see our members support
 the combination of the unstrike at the retail outlets and picketing
 at the Distribution Centre. This was originally planned for
 May 1st if we were in a legal position but this has been nixed
 at least until May 15th. 

<l>HARGROVE TO MEET YOUR NEGOTIATIONS COMMITTEE AND LOCAL UNIONS'
 LEADERSHIP. 

<l>Our National Union President, Buzz Hargrove will meet with our
 Union Negotiating Committee and the Lower Mainland CAW Local
 Union leadership this Wednesday at our Union Hall in New Westminster.
 

<l>After his assistant, Peggy Nash, and the undersigned gave a report
 to our recent CAW National Leadership Conference in Ontario
 and Buzz said "if Starbucks does not return to the table and
 deal with the key issues including wages we may have to organize
 a boycott" (of course when we are in a legal position to do
 so). 

<l>A worldwide boycott of Starbucks would only be as a last resort.
 However, Starbucks has to realize with closure of the Distribution
 Centre and its failure to bargain in good faith with our Union
 the result is a boycott. We will not only rely on the strength
 of our membership at Starbucks but on the entire support of
 the labour movement around the world. 

<l>UNION NEGOTIATING COMMITTEE TO ALSO MEET CLC HEAD - BOB WHITE
 

<l>On Saturday afternoon at our Union Hall (May 3rd) Bob White will
 meet with your Committee. In addition to heading up the Canadian
 Labour Congress, Bob is an officer of the International Confederation
 of Trade Unions. We know we can count on Bob to get the word
 out on Starbucks conduct in negotiations to date. 

<l>GENEVA DELEGATES HEAR FIRST HAND 

<l>CAW Local 3000 President, Denise Kellahan, spoke of the announced
 closure of the Distribution Centre and the other key issues
 in bargaining to the Food Union's world wide Congress in Geneva,
 Switzerland a couple of weeks ago. She has made some invaluable
 future contacts. Seventy-four countries from around the world
 attended the Congress. 

<l>GUATEMALAN LABOUR EDUCATION SUPPORT GROUP CONTACTS CAW 

<l>Stephen Coats informs us that Starbucks wants a meeting soon
 with his Chicago based group after his group threatened a boycott
 of Starbucks for its failure to enforce its Code of Practice
 for coffee growers in Guatemala. 

<l>Stephen seemed to be really upset with the announced closure
 of the Distribution Centre just after our successful strike
 vote. He has asked us for more details about our dispute. 

<l>LRB HEARING MAY 7TH - 9TH 

<l>The adjudication side of the Labour Relations Board will begin
 to hear sworn evidence on the Union's complaint concerning of
 the Company's illegal lockout and bargaining in bad faith surrounding
 the announced closure of the Distribution Centre and the failure
 of the Company to produce a wage offer to date as well as its
 illegal proposal on benefits. 

<l>These hearing take place at the Labour Relations Board which
 is located at Library Square. They are open to the public but
 have very limited seating unfortunately. 

<l>'CITIZENS IN SUPPORT OF STARBUCKS WORKERS' BEING FORMED 

<l>Since the public announcement of the closure of the Distribution
 Centre we have had lots of calls. This has resulted in a 'Citizens
 Group' being formed to support you.
