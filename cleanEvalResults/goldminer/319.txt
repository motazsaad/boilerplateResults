<p>NewTeamwork Vs. Teams

<p>Teamwork and teams have been buzzwords for about a decade. Many
 organizations want to hook onto the "team" train. Teams are
 great - in the right circumstances. Teamwork is expected. However,
 there is a difference. Teams are a noun or the "what". Teamwork
 is an adjective or the "how" or the process. Establishing teams
 and teamwork first comes with understanding of what they are
 and in what situations they can be effective. Join this workshop
 to find out whether teams and teamwork are right for you and
 your company. Topics include: - understanding the difference
 between teams and teamwork - applying teamwork principles -
 when and when not to establish teams - effective team characteristics
 - why teams succeed and why they fail
