<h> Christmas Tree Fertility 

<p>Optimum fertilization promotes quality growth and gives trees
 luxuriant foliage with a deep, rich color. Trees with balanced
 nutrients are more resistant to pest problems and environmental
 stresses. The amount of fertilizer or lime needed to achieve
 optimum nutrient levels in the tree will vary with different
 soils and sites or even different land use history. Too much
 of a nutrient is often as harmful to Christmas trees as too
 little. The only way to optimize tree growth is to follow through
 with site-specific fertilizer applications based on the results
 of timely soil and tissue analysis. Effective fertilizer management
 is an ongoing process that succeeds best when carefully planned
 and maintained throughout the crop rotation. 

<p> Soil samples should be taken regularly throughout the course
 of growing Christmas trees. The first soil samples should be
 taken during initial site evaluation. If the pH or nutrients
 such as phosphorus or calcium are low, materials can be tilled
 into the soil before tree planting with greater success than
 later top dressing of fertilizers or lime. Subsequent soil samples
 should be collected at least every other year, and many growers
 choose to take annual samples. Time invested in careful collection
 of soil samples will increase effectiveness of any following
 fertilizer applications. In North Carolina, soil sample boxes
 can be obtained and samples sent from any North Carolina Cooperative
 Extension Service County Center. The North Carolina Department
 of Agriculture provides soil and plant tissue analysis as well
 as other diagnostic services to in-state residents. 

<p> Once the trees in a field are well established, plant tissue
 samples should periodically be collected along with regular
 soil samples. Tissue analysis provides the status of 11 nutrients
 inside the plant (four more than reported in soil analysis).
 Tissue sampling also reflects what a plant is actually able
 to obtain from the soil, not just what is available. Under normal
 growing conditions, tissue samples should accompany the soil
 samples at about the middle of the rotation and then again the
 year before harvest. Usually about two shoots are collected
 from the same five to 10 trees from which soil is sampled. Tissue
 sampling is a necessary tool for evaluating and fine-tuning
 fertility management. 

<p> When fertility problems occur in a field, additional sampling
 can be useful. Problem areas should be sampled (and managed)
 separately from normal areas of a field. The contrast between
 normal and problem samples can often pinpoint the cause of a
 fertility problem. Often multiple-depth soil sampling can provide
 greater insight than a single topsoil sample. When nutritional
 problems occur, matching tissue samples should accompany any
 special soil sampling. It may take several seasons to correct
 a fertility problem. 

<p> Fertilizer materials should be targeted to the recommendations
 and deficiencies identified by soil and tissue analysis for
 each field, without applying a single blended material across
 the board. Annual applications of nitrogen per acre are recommended
 based on the requirements of the crop and the age and size of
 the trees. Different amounts of a nitrogen fertilizer will be
 needed depending on the percentage of actual nitrogen contained
 in it. Different nitrogen sources have varying effect on pH,
 soluble salt index, and leaching and should be selected accordingly.
 Different blends can also satisfy the need for certain amounts
 of phosphorous, potassium, or other nutrients and should be
 selected to fulfill the ratio of requirements for each nutrient.
 See Table 4 for a list of commonly used fertilizers and their
 characteristics.

<p> Both the timing and method of fertilizer application are critical
 to successful nutrient management. Different nutrients have
 their own requirements for timing. Materials with a high soluble
 salt content containing nitrogen or potassium should not be
 applied during the heat of summer or during a drought. Large
 applications should be split between two timings. Phosphorus
 should be built up early in a crop rotation rather than adding
 an incremental amount each season. Early in a rotation, many
 growers band fertilizer outside the dripline of small trees
 to maximize availability, but after trees are about 2 years
 old, broadcast applications are most effective. Where growers
 mechanize their fertilization, they are often able to achieve
 a more uniform broadcast application. While ground-applied fertilization
 is the primary method of nutrient delivery, it occasionally
 must be supplemented with foliar-applied liquid sprays particularly
 where micronutrients are deficient or tied up in the soil. 

<p> For a fertility program to succeed, a variety of tools and methods
 must be used, usually in different combinations from season
 to season. 

<p> Vegetation may be grouped into five major categories: perennial
 grasses, perennial broadleafs, annual grasses, annual broadleafs,
 and woody perennial vegetation (trees, shrubs, and vines). 

<p> Whether the vegetation occurs between the rows or within rows
 is also important. Competition is greatest from vegetation in
 the area immediately around the tree or within a row. Vegetation
 growing between the rows is less of a competitive threat simply
 because it is further from the tree. 

<p> Since perennial grasses are very competitive, growers should
 minimize them within rows. In addition, perennial grasses found
 between rows should be mechanically or chemically mowed (suppressed
 via low rates of post-emergence herbicides) to control competition.
 

<p> While woody vegetation is not particularly competitive, it does
 interfere with tree work, and is easiest to control prior to
 planting. Since most woody vegetation is perennial with well
 established deep root systems, it can be particularly difficult
 to control. Choice of control measures and timing is critical.
 

<p> Vegetation desirable for use as groundcover generally exhibits
 one of two useful characteristics: it is naturally less competitive,
 or it is reliably controlled either through mechanical or chemical
 mowing. Less competitive groundcovers include broadleaf annuals
 or perennials that seldom grow tall enough to interfere with
 tree growth. Such species include strawberries, violets, dandelions,
 plantains, groundsels, and common trailing cinquefoil. Groundcovers
 that can and must be suppressed because they are otherwise too
 competitive or interfere with shearing or harvest include clover,
 smartweed, wild carrot, yarrow, red sorrel, nimblewill grass,
 chickweed, annual grasses, and some perennial grasses. 

<p> The two principal methods for maintaining groundcover at an
 acceptable height between the rows are mechanical mowing and
 chemical application, either separately or in combination. 

<h>Mechanical Mowing

<p>Mowing is an effective way to keep competing plants under control
 between rows. Properly timed mowing reduces competition, rodent
 damage, and fire hazard. Rotary-type mowers are usually preferred
 for grass control, as sickle bars are particularly apt to damage
 or cut trees. However, mechanical mowing will favor grass species
 that are most competitive to trees. 

<p> Mowing alone must be repeated several times during the growing
 season. It should be done often enough to prevent the grasses
 from forming seeds that could germinate within the row. Weather
 greatly determines timing of the first and subsequent mowing
 operations. A cool, dry spring can delay the first mowing. Subsequent
 mowing during the growing season depends largely on the frequency
 and amount of rainfall and fertility of the site. 

<h>Chemical Application

<p>Herbicides are an effective substitute to mechanical mowing for
 controlling competition by weeds and grasses. Herbicides are
 generally classified as either pre-emergent or post-emergent,
 depending on the stage of the weeds the herbicide is designed
 to control. 

<p> The effectiveness of a chemical can vary from no response to
 a complete kill, depending on application conditions and procedures.
 To be effective, herbicides should be carefully selected. Several
 different uses of chemicals are in new plantings in a cleanly
 cultivated field, new plantings in a sod, or on established
 plantations. Response to chemicals will depend on several factors,
 such as size, kind and growing condition of target plants, time
 of application, soil composition, rainfall, temperature, rate
 of deterioration before being incorporated into the soil, and
 persistence of the chemical. Most properly-formulated herbicides
 are short-lived in the environment, but still they must be carefully
 used to prevent long-lasting effects by changing the composition
 of the plant community. 

<p> "Chemical mowing" is a term used to describe the practice of
 applying post-emergent herbicides at low rates to stunt or suppress
 weeds and grasses. This practice was developed to provide growers
 with a cost-effective, soil conserving alternative to broadcast
 application of pre-emergence herbicides or mechanical mowing.
 Chemical mowing can be used as a broadcast application or as
 a between-row treatment where trees were previously banded in
 the row with pre-emergence herbicides. 

<p> Chemical mowing is generally more economical than traditional
 mechanical mowing. The application of low rates of herbicides
 two or three times during the growing season is usually less
 expensive than maintaining mowers and paying for the labor to
 mow several times a season. Chemical mowing typically provides
 control for 6 to 8 weeks, compared to 3 to 4 weeks for mechanical
 mowing. 

<p> Chemical mowing also fits well with many of the strategies used
 in Integrated Pest Management (IPM). It is especially important
 to the management of white grubs. By leaving a ragged height
 of suppressed vegetation, May and June beetles (the adults of
 white grubs) are less likely to lay their eggs than they are
 in mechanically mowed vegetation. 

<p> It should be noted that the need for pre-emergence herbicide
 applications cannot be totally eliminated by chemical mowing.
