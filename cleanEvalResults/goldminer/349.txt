<p> Don't Lie To Me by: Amuro Namie translated by: Curi yeah yeah
 wanna be little girl Tracing my finger down your back Walking
 along with you Inside your gentle eyes, lonliness was imprisoned
 so rumbling the trouble feeling your life covered with lie in
 tonight Your desperate face, once again Like a puzzle where
 one piece is missing, oh don't lie, don't lie to me If this
 kind of kiss is a thread that coils itself around your heart
 Then teach me how to unfasten it don't lie, don't lie to me
 Don't decieve me with your words Raise the limit of your affections,
 but I don't need just the shape gimme your hidden face you navigate
 me silently guiding the back of my neck It looks like I'm going
 to lose If I'm okay now in the future perhaps I'll grow to trust
 you be destined to paradise take it to life, ticket to ride,
 get it up night But, however A fragment with no meaning It's
 okay that it's broken But I can see true love don't lie, don't
 lie to me if in an instant It looks as if a flower can bloom,
 that's nature's way Love can spread, I can find it don't lie,
 don't lie to me If your honesty makes me sad, it's okay I don't
 want you to honey coat it You only have to show it to me tell
 me your love belief don't lie to me don't lie to me just try
 to do the things honestly you don't have to lie don't lie, don't
 lie to me If you make that kind of promise If fear is wrapped
 around my heart Then tell me how to untie it don't lie, don't
 lie to me Always wandering around Raise the limit of your affections,
 but I don't need just the shape If this is forever don't lie,
 don't lie to me if in an instant It looks as if a flower can
 bloom, that's nature's way Love can spread, I can find it don't
 lie, don't lie to me If your honesty makes me sad, it's okay
 I don't want you to honey coat it You only have to show it to
 me tell me your love belief -------

<p> LOVEBITE by: Amuro Namie translated by: Curi NEVER GONNA SAY
 No one, whoever, surely wouldn't understand MOONLIGHT The things
 of life are heartbreaking to anyone CRY (YES I DON'T KNOW WHY)
 NEVER GONNA SAY Chance encounter, misunderstanding, those days
 were worthless MOONLIGHT SO LET ME SEE I only drift through
 MY LIFE (YES I DON'T KNOW WHY) In the beginning, there was no
 meaning, I knew the time but... OH NO You held me so much LIKE
 A LOVEBITE * (I DON'T KNOW WHY, I WANT TO KNOW) The whispers
 were LIES... DON'T TELL A LIE (I DON'T KNOW WHY, I WANT TO KNOW)
 They fall from your lips * repeat I FEEL YOU, DARLIN' In the
 beginning you just made fun But...when we were together I learned
 too much LIKE A LOVEBITE ------- 

<p> Lovin' It- Amuro Namie & Verbal (mflo) Translated by: Curi I
 definetly don't know the name of every morning encounter Sometimes
 my smiling face is a look of loneliness I can't forget I have
 a modest spirit Like circumstances from a distant day Snow still
 doesn't come Where did it go? I look at the stars Are things
 all right? I'm concerned Perpetually? Like the feeling from
 the night sky dissapearing, latter days Completely, many times
 repeating deja vu It won't stop Pass by while I'm sitting here,
 the person reaches out (It's crazy) Going against instinct Their
 real nature revealed Beginning to become a new legend, I rock
 it The challenge is my only thought Ah, in this way people will
 meet up Ah, and people will come together This is all, but I
 want this to happen Who important people have next to them What
 important things are next to them * every day every morning
 I thank the lord above for the kindness of your love every day
 every morning I thank the lord above for the tenderness of your
 love of your love... (RAP) I be lovin' it, I be lovin' it...human
 nature I be lovin' it, I be lovin' it...always progressing I
 be lovin' it, I be lovin' it...everyday I be lovin' it, I be
 lovin' it...love, lovin' it I be lovin' it, I be lovin' it...your
 sensitivity I be lovin' it, I be lovin' it...always fresh I
 be lovin' it, I be lovin' it...everyday I be lovin' it, I be
 lovin' it...love, lovin' it * repeat every day every morning
 I thank the lord above for the sweetness of your love The snow
 still doesn't come Things I sadly can't forget, I remember what
 I've done ---------------  Namie Style by: Amuro Namie Translated

  Put 'Em Up by: Amuro Namie Translated by: Curi Just one day,
 suddenly the morning's over The stupid boys cause a disturbance
 Let me see who's over there with club chics Wherever you look,
 these snobby Casanovas Think it's fun to make a habit of cheating
 There's nothing like that kind of appearance I missed the evidence
 before But starting now, I think I get it If I go somewhere,
 then I can go out I can do things, I can mess around Which one
 is 'beneath me,' ain't nothing new Anything you do, I'll do
 it better than you A flirting love game, fine I can play games
 Forgetting your name, I can do the same I'm the number one sharpest
 one It's impossible to deceive a woman's emotions Secretly bend
 backward, put 'em up My unintentional, sudden impulse is your
 fatal wound Thanks to you, my weaponry is your dilemma I can
 get down, I can get down The rules of dying abroad I've exposed
 your cheating, fool If you got chics then you better put'em
 up You lose, you were too late The instant the phone rings In
 a confused manner, a secret is revealed In a sweet voice, 'where
 is she?' Could this be my challenger!? I'm not just listening
 in I'm using my own judgement I get in the car That boy is mine,
 I believe it * repeat ** repeat 4x Secretly bend backwards,
 put 'em up ** repeat --------

 Is it love, is it passion, oh no on the front lines, on purpose
 Showing off all the time, only to do it again thought it's juss
 foolish Too late, someone saw you doing it The way you break
 dates with people you meet i said "sorry boy..." A sudden indication
 eye 2 eye (eye 2 eye) Moon on a clear night face 2 face (face
 2 face) Bodies facing each other heart 2 heart see my destiny
 This instant Where did you go until now? And Although I searched
 the whole time And whispering to my chest Drawing you towards
 me holdin me too tight * so crazy my passion awakens My awoken
 heart resets Ooo you step into my life (step into my life) Everything
 changes so crazy nothing, I don't know I could keep it closed
 but I don't know I maybe crazy however (crazy however) No one
 can stop (crazy 4 ya love) Almost seduced Falling for you funny,
 it's funny Up until now I've been by myself Somehow I know how
 to laugh my girls just don't understand It's a miracle that
 we ended up meeting i think he is the one Always connecting
 hand 2 hand (hand 2 hand) One over the other soul 2 soul (soul
 2 soul) Trusting our instincts body 2 body must be destiny Absolutely
 Harmoniously gazing into each other's eyes This is the real
