<p>Risk Disclosure: Trading foreign exchange on margin carries a
 high level of risk, and may not be suitable for all investors.
 The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as
 for you. Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange you should
 carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience,
 and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain
 a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore
 you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose.
 You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign
 exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial
 advisor if you have any doubts.
