<p> WHATEVER MAKES YOU HAPPY - REVIEWS 

<p> 

<p>Dan Lander, Rolling Stone - July 2004

<p> 

<p>A great guitarist resists the urge to over play. 

<p>Jeff Lang comes to &ldquo;Whatever Makes You Happy&rdquo; draped
 in his finest singer-songwriter regalia, letting his renowned
 guitar work serve the songs rather than sit as the only attraction
 on the album. Tracks like &ldquo;Alive in There&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
 Day I Got Chewing Gum Stuck in my Hair&rdquo; intertwine his
 delicate guitar with aching, ambient backings to build songs
 that focus on his gentle voice and subtle turn of phrase rather
 than his fret work.When Lang does unleash his guitar genius,
 like on the rollicking minor blue-grass of &ldquo;The Road is
 Not Your Only Friend&rdquo;, it is clear that he is still striving
 to put that guitar into the context of a good song, and his
 commitment to that approach pays off.

<p>Whammo Review

<p> 

<p>Jeff Lang could potentially be the most commercially viable of
 the 'blokes with acoustic guitars' revolution, swinging from
 Malacca's reverence of dust to Petty's slick swagger, often
 applied with punchy hooks more akin to Billy Joel than a rootsy
 master of strings. He's got a powerful voice when it clicks
 into fourth gear and as for his work on guitar; if it's got
 strings, he can play it. To me, it sounds like there was - and
 possibly still is - a worship of the American classics, but
 while he allows this to be an influence, Jeff doesn't go ruining
 the whole sound with a thick yank drawl; the local accent shines
 through enough for us to claim this music as homegrown.

<p>From the most raw folk through to the more upbeat rock-tinged
 numbers, Lang runs the full gamut of organic genres and Whatever
 Makes You Happy is a worthy contribution to the short list of
 truly able players that are bubbling to the surface in 2004.
 Initially, I was impressed with a dense sound that filled the
 room as The Save blasted out of my many speakers, but after
 Alive In There, I was starting to think that Lang's sound was
 bigger than any of his songs. Luckily, Rain On Troy proved his
 worth as a composer, aided by the guidance of his smooth vocal
 tones. Current Jeff Lang fans will be interested to know that
 a Special 2CD Limited Edition of this album comes with studio
 outtakes and the many fans of John Butler get extra value out
 of the bonus material with two live tracks recorded at the Continental
 in Melbourne, with Jeff, John and Angus Diggs. 

<p>Jeff Lang probably has a more mature appeal than his peers, but
 if there was any time for a push into mainstream circles, 2004
 must be the perfect opportunity and with an album like Whatever
 Makes You Happy, many doors are sure to open.

<p> 

<p>Roots-inspired music and its assorted genres are in the middle
 of a massive explosion. Jeff Lang&rsquo;s new set proves that
 the quality and talent is there and now it is up to the marketing
 department to get the sounds out to the public. The album opens
 with an irresistible foot-tapper in The Save, a clear winner
 with its propulsive percussion and melodies. But then this is
 an entire album of appealing material that elegantly twists
 its way into your subconscious. An upbeat number like You Should
 Have Waited emphasis the importance of shading when putting
 together an album like this. Everything here is in equal measure,
 compliments everything else and just makes you wanted hear it
 interpreted live.

<p> 

<p>Jeff Lang is one of those unusual musical characters in that
 he divides the listening public not into one of love or hate,
 but simply into those that know and those that don&rsquo;t,
 yet. It&rsquo;s a borderline cult obsession the man unwittingly
 casts through his dramatic and interactive live shows and unwavering
 recorded (and live) consistency. Hell, Lang can lure a crowd
 to a backwater venue in a quaint US country town for God&rsquo;s
 sake, and did so last year. Not to mention performing with both
 the Bobs (Dylan and Geldolf) in recent times. 

<p>All this background is needed to first understand exactly what
 a new Jeff Lang release means to many people, and secondly to
 appreciate why the polite Melbourne singer/songwriter has done
 what he&rsquo;s done on Whatever Makes You Happy. Strictly speaking
 this new album from Lang isn&rsquo;t a solo offering. He&rsquo;s
 gone against the grain of the solo ethos and enlisted backing
 vocalists, piano, brass and harmonica to his now core band of
 Angus Diggs (drums) and Grant Cummerford (bass).

<p>The results are typically stunning, brimming with life and the
 overall feel is still recognisable as having tumbled from Lang.
 Check out The Save, You Should Have Waited and the slower By
 Face Not Name and Rain On Troy for some inspired sounds.

<p>Time for a big fat one.

<p>
 &ldquo;Whatever makes you happy&rdquo; the new cd by Jeff Lang
 is destined to become one of those fade-proof recordings that
 gives a good cd collection its bones. This is a disc full of
 blues informed stories carried on a contemporary-roots hybrid
 music style - with plenty of pounding pantry percussion, some
 quiet whispering, and lots of legit musical goodness.

<p>On it, the guitar plays second string to the writing as Lang
 gives his songs only what they need. Don&rsquo;t be alarmed
 though, because there&rsquo;s enough busting out lickety-split
 guitar (and mandolin) to keep axe heads happy. After all, guitar
 art is what Jeff Lang is known for best. 

<p>Unusual in construction, instrumentals hang off of the end of
 some songs like post-it notes, giving the whole recording an
 extended presence. Most songs are fretted with a raw and vaguely
 troubled undertow. The winged and wild, &ldquo;The road is not
 your only friend&rdquo; works up to an alarmingly neurotic shrill.
 Come track 9, &ldquo;Rejected novelist fails again&rdquo;, and
 we find that we are not alone (el sol salio anoche y me canto!)
 I&rsquo;d flag this song as a favourite. &ldquo;Slip Away&rdquo;
 has a gorgeous groove, reminiscent of, say, a Kelly Joe Phelps
 recording. 

<p>What I like about the production of &ldquo;Whatever makes you
 happy&rdquo; is the fact that Jeff didn&rsquo;t go for super
 slick hydraulics (which he could easily have done if he did
 in fact have the plump production purse inferred by several
 Australian music-journalists) Nope, this is spag bog with grit;
 ice cream and tomato sauce, or if you prefer, raw pineapple
 with salty yeast spread. The inclusion of a dilly bag full of
 other talented Aussie musicians has enabled Lang to deliver
 a musical picture in wide screen format, and hints of big possibilities
 for future recordings.

<p>The instrumental &ldquo;Whatever makes you happy&rdquo; is like
 a carefree shrug at the end of the cd, and bugger me if there
 isn&rsquo;t just the teensiest hint of reggae. Yes. Me thinks
 it&rsquo;s time for a big fat one.

<p>JEFF APTER, The Bulletin, August 2004 - 

<p> 

<p>There's a real lost-in-space vibe about the latest album from
 Jeff Lang, the Melbourne blues/folk guitar ace. Whatever Makes
 You Happy could have just as easily emerged from Woodstock,
 1969, as Melbourne, 2004.

<p>Now bankrolled by a major, Lang brings in some pals (blues-belter
 Chris Wilson, harp-blower Matt Walker), as well as tinkering
 in the studio with everything from pre-digital gear to op-shop
 kitchenware. While best known for pulling off the type of fleet-fingered
 stringwork rarely heard this side of trailer-park bard Chris
 Whitley, don&rsquo;t overlook Lang&rsquo;s knack for storytelling.
 It&rsquo;s as if he wrote most of this first-rate album with
 his car window cracked, as he barrelled down the highway, heading
 for some dusty outpost

<p> 

<p>Tony Hillier  - Barfly 5 FLIES

<p> 

<p>If 2001&rsquo;s Everything Is Still lifted Jeff Lang to a new
 benchmark, Whatever Makes You Happy nails him to the upper rung
 of creative artists.  The Victorian&rsquo;s last studio album
 was a prime candidate for best domestic release of the decade;
 his debut recording for ABC Music is in many ways its equal,
 and in some respects superior.

<p>
 Whatever Makes You Happy sees Lang move a little further away
 from his original blues base.  Long regarded as one of the country&rsquo;s
 most innovative and versatile guitar slingers, he is now firmly
 established among the upper echelon of singer-songwriters, alongside
 the likes of Paul Kelly, Don Walker and Shane Howard.  Lang&rsquo;s
 songs have a cinematic quality; his vignettes resonate with
 vivid imagery, poetry, passion, and intelligence.  Many seem
 to reflect the writer&rsquo;s protracted spells on the road
 both here and in the USA; the loneliness of the long distance
 touring artist if you will.

<p>
 The songs are given additional depth by Lang&rsquo;s sheer
 musical invention; the writer&rsquo;s trademark heart-tugging
 melodies, the dexterity of his guitar playing and sharp sense
 of dynamics (two of his strongest qualities), and the telepathic
 rapport he enjoys with his regular rhythm section, drummer extraordinaire
 Angus Diggs and bassman Grant Cummerford.  In Whatever Makes
 You Happy, Jeff also recruits the services of some carefully
 selected special guests and instrumentation, giving his songs
 an expanded range of stylistic setting.  On &lsquo;By Face,
 Not Name&rsquo;, a chilling story of rape and its aftermath,
 he engages in a vocal duet with Suzannah Espie with the latter&rsquo;s
 GIT colleagues and Chris Wilson on back-up vocals.  On &lsquo;Rain
 on Troy&rsquo;, a song of despair that cuts to the quick, the
 pervading sadness is eerily echoed by Azo Bell&rsquo;s eloquent
 singing saw.  &lsquo;You Tremble&rsquo;, a disturbing love song,
 employs vibraphone and looped percussion as atmospherics.  On
 the boisterous &lsquo;Rejected Novelist Fails Again&rsquo;,
 the inherent frustration and impending sense of calamity is
 bolstered by trombones and tuba.  In &lsquo;You Should&sup1;ve
 Waited&rsquo; and &lsquo;Sleeping&rsquo;, Bruce Haymes&rsquo;
 Bruce Hornsby-esque piano is complements Lang&rsquo;s acoustic
 and electric guitars and lap steel.  Matt Walker&rsquo;s harmonica
 proves a perfect foil to Jeff&rsquo;s national guitar in the
 superbly evocative &lsquo;Alive in There&rsquo;, a bluesy song
 that reeks of country Australia or mid-West USA (&lsquo;It&rsquo;s
 a dry heat that blew him through town / Why would a service
 station throw its shadow down? / Does anybody live here? / Is
 there anyone alive in here?&rsquo;).  Fiddle follows Lang&rsquo;s
 fast and furious mandolin and national guitar finger-picking
 to give the closing song, &lsquo;The Road Is Not Your Only Friend&rsquo;,
 a kind of New Grass Revival meets Richard Thompson feel. It&rsquo;s
 almost a companion piece to the riveting first track, &lsquo;The
 Save&rsquo;, which, courtesy of Diggs&rsquo; percussion (and
 Lang&rsquo;s guitars and trowel), hurtles along like the Indian
 Pacific mentioned in the opening line.

<p>
 The songs on Whatever Makes You Happy are punctuated by four
 short, sharp instrumental interludes (three of less than 40
 seconds duration), two featuring the talents of that under-exposed
 guitarist and percussionist Chris Finnen.  The Adelaide maestro&rsquo;s
 affinity with Indian music - and no doubt Jeff Lang&rsquo;s
 increasing interest in world sounds, cultivated by his liaison
 with Bob Brozman - is evident on the bonus disc of outtakes,
 which features some inspired jamming including a heavy duty
 work-out.   Also included on CD2 is a medley of two songs recorded
 live at Melbourne&rsquo;s sadly defunct Continental Cafe with
 a cameo appearance from John Butler (who cites Jeff Lang as
 a major influence). 

<p>
 As far as this reviewer is concerned, Whatever Makes You Happy
 is already a top candidate for 2004&rsquo;s Australian album
 of the year.

<p>Julie Fox - Sydney Blues Society Newsletter

<p> 

<p>Have you ever heard anyone describe Jeff Lang&#8217;s style as
 mellow or peaceful &#8211; well neither had I, and never thought
 I would be using those words to convey how I felt on listening
 to this excellent offering - Jeff&#8217;s long awaited 13th
 CD. I had heard touches of Jeff&#8217;s vocals reach quite high
 notes before, but this recording showcases an entirely different
 format for his music. Previously as an Independent artist, Jeff
 always seemed to be hovering on the doorstep of commercial success
 and acceptance in Australia, but with this latest CD, and signing
 to the ABC label, surely the doors must open to welcome him
 onto mainstream play lists. If Whatever Makes You Happy doesn&#8217;t
 do it then I can&#8217;t imagine what else could! 

<p>Jeff&#8217;s new approach might have had something to do with
 the musicians he chose to help him on this production. Featuring
 heavily with backing vocals is the all-girl group Git from Melbourne,
 whose voices blend perfectly with Jeff&#8217;s vocal pitch.
 Jeff also enlisted the help of fellow singer/songwriter/guitarist
 Tim Hall to co-produce this album. Then we have the perfect
 rhythm section of Angus Diggs (drums/percussion) and Grant Cummerford
 (electric &amp; acoustic bass). Several tracks also feature
 Chris Wilson (backing vocals), Matt Walker (harp), Chris Finnen
 (acoustic guitar), as well as various others on piano, vibraphone,
 fiddle, a horn section and one guy playing singing saw! 

<p>If you are talking &#8216;value for money&#8217; then CD one
 contains 15 tracks, all written by Jeff, with some collaborations
 being Lang/Finnen/Diggs/Cummerford. Included are 4 beautiful
 instrumentals; although so short they are almost a teaser. Standout
 tracks would have to be the haunting piece By Face, Not Name,
 with Suzanah Espie (Git) sharing vocals and Jeff playing lap
 steel guitar. Rejected Novelist Fails Again has the best lyrics,
 with a touch of Jeff&#8217;s heavier electric guitar and horn
 section. You Tremble, beautifully sung with Jeff using his National
 steel guitar and loop percussion. The Road Is Not Your Only
 Friend changes tack with the use of mandolin and fiddle; frenetic
 Celtic music might a good description &#8211; works well! The
 title track, another too-short instrumental, finally brings
 this CD to a close, but wait, there&#8217;s more &#8211; CD
 two contains 3 tracks &#8211; Studio outtake one and two &#8211;
 both instrumentals, each running for around 20 minutes! Track
 3, Too Easy To Kill/Hellhound On My Trail sees Jeff back on
 vocals. This bonus CD was recorded live at the Continental in
 Melbourne and also features guest artist John Butler, who aptly
 sums up the situation with this comment: &#8220;Jeff Lang is
 the man as far as I am concerned&#8221;!
