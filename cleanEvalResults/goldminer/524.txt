<p>Precision Instruments for accomplished Engineers

<p>Quality of workmanship, field engineering and system performance
 are determined by the skills and expertise of the engineer but
 no engineer can perform precision works without precision instruments.
 The course will also cover the following instruments: 

<p>UnaOhm SBM105C Satellite Analog Digital Signal AnalyserThe SBM105
 analyses the quality of satellite receive signals and offers
 all measurements required by digital communication channels.
 Is also offers level measurement of analog signals as well as
 spectral analysis of the band.

<p>SMARTToolPrecision level meter for setting and alignment of antenna
 to ensure optimum signal strength and maximum system reliability.

<p>SUUNTO Bearing Compass &amp; ClinometerThe Suunto Tandem is a
 liquid-filled precision compass and clinometer in one compact
 aluminum housing that is easy to use and rugged enough to protect
 against impact, corrosion and water.

<p>GARMIN&#8217;s eTrex Personal NavigatorThis compact, easy-to-operate
 GPS is perfect for measuring and recording of location coordinates
 with the accuracy required for VSAT network control systems.

<p>Handheld ToolsThe perfect set of handheld tools to ensure that
 you have the correct tool for every need while at the same time
 being lightweight and convenient to carry under all circumstances.
 All of which are supplied in an easy and convenient canvass
 bag.

<p> Bookings will only be confirmed after you have made payment.

 The VSAT Training event is the ONLY event in West Africa that
 brings VSAT value, learning, networking and opportunity together
 in one place. Do you want to be part of the current and future
 African Telecom boom? You MUST attend this event.
