<h>Journalism Tools

<p>This page offers links to a Tool Box of ideas, strategies and
 techniques about how to produce and understand journalism. The
 materials were collected by the Committee of Concerned Journalists,
 a consortium of more than 7,000 working in news around the world.

<p>There are Tools For Citizens, including a Citizens Bill of Journalism
 Rights, as well as tools for people who work in print, in television,
 radio and online, as well as for teachers and for students.
 The ideas, collected from talking with citizens and journalists
 around the country, are regularly updated. They are meant to
 help both the the public that consumes the news and the journalists
 who endeavor produce it on the public&#39;s behalf.
