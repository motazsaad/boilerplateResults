<p>Well, I finally saw return of the king last night. I thought
 it was (predictably) great, and I (predictably) kicked myself
 for having not seeing it on the big screen. I&#8217;ll probably
 watch it again tonight so I can see all the parts I missed while
 Melissa was chatting, cheering, crying etc.

<p>Tonight when I watch it though I&#8217;m going to drink&#8230;
 and from the looks of things heavily. Tim and I made up a few
 rules to a Lord of the Rings drinking game today during lunch
 time. Let me know the results if you end up trying it out yourself.
 Use the comments feature on this site to suggest/add your own
 rules too.

<p>Every time a close-up of Frodo&#8217;s eyes takes up more than
 50% of the screen&#8230; take a drink

<p>Every time you mistake the (male) elf briefly for a hot blonde
 chick&#8230; take a drink (NOTE: your ability to distinguish
 between the two is sure to diminish the longer you play this
 game, making this particular rule a very slippery slope)

<p>Trying watching all three The Lord of the Rings movies&#8230;
 The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of
 the King&#8230; sequentially while playing this game and you
 have a whole weekend full of entertainment right there! 

<p>Talk about some mad Photoshop skills! This site is running a
 very cool image editing contest&#8230; dress up famous nudes.
 I&#8217;ve posted my &#8216;winner&#8217; below but definitely
 worth a click-through. We&#8217;re not talking run of the mill
 famous nudes here like Pamela Anderson or other Playboy bunnies&#8230;
 we&#8217;re talking classical famous nudes like David, Venus,
 etc.. These uber-talented Photoshop users are prolly the same
 guys who make the women on the covers of magazines look so amazingly
 beautiful&#8230; and fake.

<p>From time to time inevitably everyone has to justify their existence
 within a corporation. &#8220;What do you do exactly?&#8221;
 &#8220;What value do you provide the organization?&#8221; &#8220;What
 impact would it have on &#8216;us&#8217; if &#8216;we&#8217;
 didn&#8217;t have &#8216;you&#8217;?&#8221;

<p>When it comes to design, measuring quantifiable value can be
 difficult and we are often forced to use more qualitative metrics
 to measure the value that good aesthetics and proper design
 brings to a company.

<p>In the past couple days I&#8217;ve found a couple good resources
 that attempt to illustrate in quantifiable terms the impact
 of design on an enterprise. The net net of both is a conclusion
 that most of us who work in the applied arts field already know&#8230;
 companies that are design-driven outperform those that are not.
 Now bring on the charts and figures!

<p>Impact of Design on Stock Market Performance- The Design Council
The
 design council has produced an excellent research report documenting
 the valuation of companies considered to be &#8216;design-driven&#8217;
 vis-a-vis those that are not over a period of 10 years. A great
 test in terms a CFO can understand. Over time what is the tangible
 effect of design on a company and it&#8217;s shareholders The
 results? Design driven companies outperform the market by 200%!

<p>&#8220;Companies recognized as effective users of design strongly
 outperform their peers on the stock market - that is the key
 finding of a ground-breaking study which has tracked a total
 of 166 design-led companies over ten years of UK share price
 activity. 

<p>A group of 63 companies, grouped into a &#8216;Design Portfolio&#8217;
 for their consistent showing in various design award schemes,
 outperformed both the FTSE All Share and FTSE 100 indices by
 around 200% between 1994 and 2003, the study reveals.&#8221;

<p>My buddies have a little non-profit fundraising group called
 Debauchery for Donations and they&#8217;re pulling together
 a great benefit party this weekend call Spring Bling to benefit
 Big Bam; an organization that provides medical services to women

 Crossley, Bixby Jamison, Dana Pauls, David Dolby, George Hume,
 Jessica Sterling, Jim Black, and Lisa Ludwig) is known for having
 some of best events in the City and you should come check it

<p>The party will take place on Saturday, May 22nd and will feature
 live music from one of the Bay Area&#8217;s hottest tribute
 bands - STUNG!, the ultimate tribute to the POLICE. Followed
 by hip hop beats spun on two turntables and a microphone.

<p>I&#8217;ll be there&#8230; and if you&#8217;re lucky I&#8217;ll

<p>This is not a politcal blog or activism website. I don&#8217;t
 have an agenda, but I do have a problem with the way we are
 running our international affairs. Specifically, I think we
 are loosing the war in Iraq.

<p>America hasn&#8217;t made friends of the Iraqi people.
In the
 poll, 80 percent of the Iraqis questioned reported a lack of
 confidence in the Coalition Provisional Authority, and 82 percent
 said they disapprove of the U.S. and allied militaries in Iraq.
 (Salt Lake Tribune, May 13)

<p>Bremer, and the Iraqi Governing Council have failed and their
 jobs will be turned over to the UN if it&#8217;s a mission they
 choose to accept.
&#8220;We sit in the council while the country
 is burning and argue over procedure,'&#8217; says Sheikh Yawar,
 a Sunni tribal leader who lived abroad until last year. &#8220;We&#8217;re
 like the Byzantines in Constantinople, debating whether angels
 are male or female with the barbarians at the gate.&#8221; Under
 Mr. Brahimi&#8217;s plan for a transitional government, all
 25 members of the US-appointed council would be culled in favor
 of a team of technocrats to be chosen next month by Brahimi&#8217;s
 team and influential Iraqis, with US input. The group would
 take power in July and shepherd Iraq to elections next January
 - in which, ideally, they would not participate. (Christian
 Science Monitor, May 13)

<p>The war is expensive, bloody, and indefinite.
The official, Deputy
 Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz, acknowledged that a surge
 of violence and other problems in Iraq had led to rising costs,
 with no certainty yet when they would fall. (NY Times, May 13)

<p>The world is less safe than it was before we started, and there
 are more terrorists now than ever.
The AP-Ipsos poll, released
 Wednesday at The Associated Press annual meeting, found: Half
 feel that, in some measure, the terrorists might be winning
 the war on terrorism. One in five in the poll feels strongly
 the terrorists are winning while an additional 30 percent say
 there is at least “a little truth” to that statement.
More
 than one-third say they have less faith in government’s ability
 to protect them, and an additional one-fourth say there’s
 at least some truth to that idea.
Nearly half feel strongly
 they are more pessimistic about the possibility of there ever
 being peace in the world while an additional one-fourth say
 there may be some truth to that. (MSNBC, April 22)

<p>More than 50% of America&#8217;s troops are deployed, reservists
 tours are extended again, and the military is stretched thin.
The
 US has committed most of its heavy ground forces and deployable
 aircraft carriers, as well as a large share of its best attack
 aircraft and air- and sea-lift units. (Washington Post, April
 
The newly announced troop extensions — which broke the Pentagon&#8217;s
 promise that Iraq tours of duty would be limited to one year
 — are forcing many to change plans, cancel weddings and delay
 return to normal life. Meanwhile, the anxiety felt by those
 at home increases each day. (ABS News, April 23)

<p>America has failed to uncover the weapons that led us into this
 war.
During the annual Radio and Television Correspondents Dinner
 this week, Bush presented a slide show of quirky photographs
 from inside the White House. In one, the president is looking
 under furniture in the Oval Office. &#8220;Those weapons of
 mass destruction have got to be somewhere,&#8221; Bush joked.
 &#8220;Nope, no weapons over there &#8230; maybe under here?&#8221;

<p>Google launched a cool new service called Gmail. I&#8217;ve landed
 a beta account and it seems pretty hot. You get 1000megs of
 space vs. MSN Hotmails 2megs making it an actually useful mailbox.
 It&#8217;s pretty interesting how it turns back and forth barrage
 of short emails into threads or &#8216;conversations&#8217;.
 It also takes advantage of Google search technology to keep
 my email life organized. I&#8217;ve set up my kk@burnkit.com
 address to forward there. Gmail would be really cool though
 if you could POP several accounts like you can over at Hotmail
 where I had been popping my old TWU mail, my Burnkit mail, and
 my groovy.com mail. Anyway, I&#8217;m hooked. Checked it out
 when it becomes generally available.

<p>I&#8217;ve also been expiramenting with this other online networking
 tool called LinkedIn. I got turned onto it from a good friend,
 Ean Jackson, in Vancouver who always seems to be on the cutting
 edge of this type of thing&#8230; he got me up and running on
 Plaxo too. It kinda seems like Friendster but for business contacts.
 You upload information about yourself and your professional
 experience and jobs you&#8217;ve held. People who have worked
 with you in the past can write testimonials or references. It&#8217;s
 kinda fun to mess with and a good way to &#8216;practice&#8217;
 marketing oneself, but I&#8217;m still skeptical that I&#8217;ll
 get any good job leads or new contacts from it&#8230; we&#8217;ll
 see. Lemme know if any of you guys sign up and I&#8217;ll write
 you up a little reference and beg you for one for me as well.
