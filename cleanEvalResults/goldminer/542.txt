<h>Better Opportunities for Single Soldiers

<p>Better Opportunities for Single Soldiers (BOSS) is a program
 that supports the overall quality of single Soldiers' lives.
  BOSS identifies well-being issues and concerns by recommending
 improvements through the chain of command.  BOSS encourages
 and assists single Soldiers in identifying and planning for
 recreational and leisure activities.  Additionally, it gives
 single Soldiers the opportunity to participate in and contribute
 to their respective communities.

<p>The BOSS program originated in 1989 to respond to the recreational
 needs of single Soldiers ages 18 - 25 who make up 35% of the
 Army.  As the program was implemented throughout the Army, it
 became evident that quality of life was the primary concern
 to single Soldiers.  In 1991, the Chief of Staff of the Army
 officially expanded BOSS to include all aspects of Soldiers'
 lives.  Some BOSS members then began to express an interest
 in participating in community service projects, which was added
 as a component of the program.  These components...recreation
 and leisure, well being, and community service are the core
 of the BOSS program.

<h>A Place To Call Home

<p>written by a Staff Writer for the Fort Lee Traveller,

<p>The Better Opportunities for Single Soldiers building was a work
 in progress much like the program itself. The grand opening
 of the renovated facility Friday recognized the achievement
 of both.

<p>Not long ago, the BOSS program was a membership of few. Senior
 advisor Command Sgt. Maj. Wayne Hall, Fort Lee garrison command
 sergeant major, and civilian advisor James Mitchell led a handful
 of representatives determined to make the program relevant on
 post.

<p>Housed within the cramped office space within the barracks off
  A Avenue  , the group expanded to more than a dozen active
 members. Representatives became responsible for fundraising
 projects around post, and alerted fellow single Soldiers to
 social activities and events.

<p>As the program evolved, the opportunity to relocate became available.
 BOSS members helped the Red Cross move to their new location,
 and even volunteered to paint the new facility. Renovations
 began immediately on the BOSS building.

<p>More space meant more work, as BOSS members spent their free
 time painting, tearing down walls and decorating.

<p>The  Fort Lee  community chipped in with donations. Contributions
 of home furnishings and other items helped create what BOSS
 president Spc. Michael Gray said in closing remarks at the grand
 opening ceremony, &ldquo;a place to call home.&rdquo;

<p>Gray credited several organizations for their support, including
 Army Community Service, Morale, Welfare and Recreation and the
 Association of the United States Army.

<p>&ldquo;Never before has BOSS had a centrally-located facility
 with enough space where representatives can conduct meetings,
 members can enjoy amenities &#150; and most importantly, a place
 where the members can relax and interact socially,&rdquo; said
 Gray.
