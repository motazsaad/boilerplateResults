<h>High Blood Pressure Guide

<p>Blood pressure is defined as the force in the arteries when the
 heart beats (systolic pressure) and when the heart is at rest
 (diastolic pressure). It's measured in millimeters of mercury
 (mm Hg). The measurement is written one above or before the
 other, with the systolic number on top and the diastolic number
 on the bottom.

<p>High blood pressure, or hypertension, is defined in an adult
 as a blood pressure greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg systolic
 pressure or greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic pressure.

<p>High blood pressure directly increases the risk of coronary heart
 disease and stroke, especially along with other risk factors.

<p>High blood pressure can occur in children or adults, but it's
 more common among people over 35. It's particularly prevalent
 in blacks, middle-aged and elderly people, obese people, heavy
 drinkers and women who are taking birth control pills. It may
 run in families, but many people with a strong family history
 of high blood pressure never have it. People with diabetes mellitus,
 gout or kidney disease are also more likely to have hypertension.

<p>Some people can have high blood pressure for years without knowing
 it. The only way to know if you have high blood pressure is
 to have your blood pressure checked. According to recent estimates,
 one in four U.S. adults has high blood pressure, but because
 there are no symptoms, nearly one-third of these people don't
 even know they have it. This is why high blood pressure is often
 called the "silent killer."

<p>A single reading showing high blood pressure doesn't mean you
 have high blood pressure, but it's a sign that you need to watch
 it carefully. High blood pressure is typically only diagnosed
 after consistent or consecutive high readings.

<p>If your blood pressure is normal, get it checked at least every
 two years. If your blood pressure is near the top of the normal
 range, or if you have a family history of high blood pressure,
 you're at higher risk. Your doctor will tell you how often to
 have it checked.

<h>Categories for Blood Pressure Levels in Adults*

<p>When systolic and diastolic blood pressures fall into different
 categories, the higher category should be used to classify blood
 pressure level. For example, 160/80 mm Hg would be stage 2 hypertension
 (high blood pressure).

<p>BLOOD PRESSURE LEVEL (mm Hg)

<p>Category

<p>Systolic

<p>Diastolic

<p>Optimal**

<p>less than 120

<p>less than 80

<p>Normal

<p>less than 130

<p>less than 85

<p>High Normal

<p>130-139

<p>85-89

<p>High Blood Pressure

<p>Stage 1

<p>140-159

<p>90-99

<p>Stage 2

<p>160-179

<p>100-109

<p>Stage 3

<p>greater than or equal to 180

<p>greater than or equal to 110

<p>* For those not taking medicine for high blood pressure and not
 having a short-term serious illness. These categories are from
 the National High Blood Pressure Education Program. 

<p> ** Optimal blood pressure with respect to heart disease risk
 is below 120/80 mm Hg. However, unusually low readings should
 be evaluated for clinical significance.
