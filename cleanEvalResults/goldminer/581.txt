<p> DD had her annual evaluation today. She did GREAT!!!!! She is
 smack right on target for her age. She is not above or below,
 but right on target. That is good enough for me! I am so proud
 of her. 

<p>
Her teacher said we could let today be her last day or do next
 week. Truth be known, I am so DONE with biweekly visits. I asked
 DD if she wanted to come next week and work on /SH/ or be finished
 today. She wanted to do one more week. 

<p>
We went across the street and bought two videos at the pawn
 shop to celebrate &#40;they only cost $3 ea!&#41; 

<p>
I am so proud and happy for her. So glad we got her tonsils
 out. Life is GOOD! 

<p>
My DD has made HUGE strides with her speech since starting therapy
 at 3, however I think she has at least another year to go. It
 has done her a world of good for her self confidence as well.
 She only goes once a week and loves her therapist. 

<p>
I can&#39;t wait for my dd to be done with hers. She has it
 2x week in school and a double session at the hospital weekly.
 Its a pain. 

<p>
DS used to take speech but he caught up last fall and is to
 be re-evaluated this fall to see if he needs to restart again.
 I hope he doesnt have to because it is a lot of running around.
 

<p> Congrats!! Wonderful news Dana. I can assure that her speech
 therapist is just as excited. It is always a thrill to discharge
 a child who &#34;graduates&#34; because they are doing great
 &#40;as opposed to those who move, quit coming, etc.&#41;Kudos
 to both of you!! 

<p> P.S. Renee, as a therapist who works at an outpatient clinic
 at a hospital let me just tell you how highly you are esteemed
 by your DD&#39;s therapist&#40;s&#41;. We all quickly get a
 feel for &#34;good parents&#34; &#40;those who rarely miss appts.,
 who follow through with the home program, are on time, etc.&#41;
 and the not-so-good parents. We also realize what a huge sacrifice
 it is to haul your kid &#40;usually with siblings in tow&#41;
 to therapy twice a week and then sit and wait while entertaining
 bored kids in the waiting room while we work with your child.
 You are a jewel among moms! Hope your DD makes super fast progress!!

<p> Pam, you made me chuckle. How in the world did you know by my
 lil comment that I always made sure she made it to speech, we&#39;re
 never late and practiced with her??? 

<p>
I thought for sure I came off pretty badly stating how much
 a pain it was. lol 

<p>
Actually, I&#39;m not sure how long it will be before we are
 done. Out therapist hasn&#39;t yet determined if dd has apraxia
 yet. A lot leads to it but.. But she has made lots of improvement
 in the past 2 years. 

<p> Dana, apraxia &#40;a HUGE interest of mine!&#41; is when a child
 is physically capable of making speech sounds in that there
 is no muscular problem, but they have difficulty sequencing
 the sounds of speech and stringing them together. For example,
 the child can produce /p/ and /t/ and even consonant-vowel syllables
 with these sounds like pea, poo, pah, tuh, tay, etc. But when
 the 2 syllables are combined, like in &#34;potty&#34; for example,
 the child might end up saying &#34;gahfee&#34;. It is the same
 type of thing that happens if you try to say &#34;linoleum-linoleum-linoleum&#34;
 repeatedly very fast. Your mouth knows what to do, but the message
 gets short-circuited in between your brain planning the subtle
 fine motor speech movements and your mouth actually doing them.
 Apraxia results in poor articulation, but the errors are inconsistent
 and in no particularly pattern. Speech therapy to treat apraxia
 is very different than a traditional or a phonological approach
 to articulation. 

<p>
Renee, I&#39;m very curious as to why they haven&#39;t yet determined
 if she has apraxia yet if she&#39;s already been in speech 2
 years?? 

<p>
I think one reason why its taking so long is that DD has behavoral
 problems that the therapist has been working on in addition
 to the speech. I would love for them to dx it so that our insurance
 would cover it since its not covered at the moment. 

<p>
Plus dd has had problems with muscle movement She just now is
 getting used to using her tongue correctly. Before therapy started,
 she would talk without moving her mouth and it looked and sounded
 like a person whose had a stroke. 

<p>
Even though our therapist is wonderful, it does leave me wondering
 now, why it isnt dx fully yet. hmmmmmmm...
