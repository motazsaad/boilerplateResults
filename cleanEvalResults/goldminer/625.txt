<p> Does anyone know the open carry status in Tennessee? I'll be
 travelling there from NC at the end of this week. Also, what
 about car carry?

<h>Cannot carry with "the intent to go armed"

<p> From what I understand about the law in TN, you cannot carry
 on your person or loaded in your car a pistol or any other loaded
 firearm. If you carry a loaded pistol on your person or in your
 car, it is defined by law a "carry with the intent to go armed"
 and is illegal unless you have a license to carry. So I would
 carry unloaded in a case and seperated from the ammunition.

<l>General Questions on Concealed Firearm LawsQ: Why are "Concealed
 Carry Badges" frowned upon by most non-newbie ccw license permit
 holders and police?A: Because badges are a symbol of authority,
 they are easily misinterpreted as law enforcement badges, which
 for a non LEO is a bad thing. Concealed carry licences/permits
 give no authority, rather, only the permission to carry a concealed
 weapon. If the state, city, county, or town wanted to issue
 CCW permits/licences in the form of a badge, they would do so.
 If you want a badge, join a law enforcement agency or a fire
 department...their badges are usually quite pretty.
