<p>Squirrel CountingAdd fun to your early childhood counting curriculum
 with this preschool activity by Jana M.

<p>Materials: Small dixie cups , squirrel pattern and nuts. 

<p>Description: Teachers take a squirrel pattern and staple it to
 dixie cups. Write a number on each squirrel.  Now, have the
 child count out how many nuts they need for that squirrel. 
 Have a different number on each squirrel. You can also have
 the child take nuts away from the squirrel, to see how many
 he has left.

<p>Comments: Some  three's I find are not quite ready for this.
 I find that by the end of the year they're doing it much better.Take

<p>Year 'Round "Seasonal Tree"Share the ideas of the changing season
 with children just as Terry H. does.

<p>Materials: Large paper cut out of a tree with bare limbs.Summer
 - - green leavesFall - - colored leavesWinter - - Misc. items
 to be hung on tree (snowmen, mittens, hearts,Easter eggs)Spring
 - - green leavesConstruction paper and tape.

<p>Description: We place a large brown tree with bare limbs  on
 a vacant wall.  We begin the school year with green leaves on
 this tree. Teachers can put children's name on individual leaves.
 The children enjoy seeing their names placed around the room.
 I generally put flowers at the base of the tree and a sunshine
 could be put up over the tree.

<p>FALL:  Gradually start changing the green leaves to fall colored
 leaves. Once they have all changed, have them begin to "fall
 to the ground" untilthe tree is bare.  We make pumpkins to put
 under the tree to replace the flowers and at halloween time
 add faces to these pumpkins.

<p>WINTER:  Explaining the seasons to the children, we tell them
 aboutsummer and fall.  Since our tree is now without leaves,
 during the winterwe will add our own "special" things to the
 tree. We make:

<p>Snowmen in DecemberMittens in JanuaryHearts in FebruaryEaster
 Eggs in March.

<p>Then the leaves begin to reappear for the spring.

<p>New for this year, we're adding apple blossoms (made from tissue
 paper) to the tree in September and then change those blossoms
 to apples. Showing it as a fall apple tree  (before we do the
 color change on the leaves).

<p>Comments: This was a new idea for last year. We are going to
 use it thisyear to really discuss the changing seasons and also
 incorporate ourapple lessons.

<p>Fire Safety SongTry this Fire Safety Song  from Valerie W. during
 Fire Safety Month.

<p>Materials: Song on chart (song is below), dog puppet, white styrofoam
 cup,googly eyes, construction paper (red, white, black) to make
 ears, (white construction paper), red tongue, red hat, and black
 spots.

<p> Description:1.  Using a dog puppet, sing this song to the tune
 of Popeye the Sailor Man.

<p> I'm Fire Safety Sam.  (ruff, ruff) Substitute lines 3 and 4
 with the following words for new verses.

<p> It's important to say..  With matches, don't play. 

<p> If there's smoke you should know,  You'd better crawl low. 

<p> Have a fire escape plan.  Every family can. 

<p> If there's a fire, get out.  Use your escape route. 

<p> Go to a neighbor's when alone,  Then call 9-1-1 on the phone.
 

<p> Clothes on fire?  Here's your goal:  First stop, then drop,

 at me    Form circles with fingers.I shook that tree as hard
 as I could    Pretend to shake a tree.Down came those apples.And

<p>Fall WreathThis early childhood education activity by Lynn A.
 begins outdoors with a naturewalk and then continues indoors.

<p>Materials: Pine cones, fall leaves in many colors, nuts, acorns,
 etc. and cardboard or oak tag, and glue.

<p>Description: After going on a nature hike for the above materials,
 cut a wreath shape out of cardboard.  Ask children to decorate
 their wreath with their own findings.  You may want to have
 them put ribbon on it too.

<p>Comments: This wreath looks so nice when done that it can be
 keptall year round.Take a look at the expanded list of Fall
 Picture Books
  

<p> Color Song:  Leaves on the TreesDuring this Autumn activity
 preschool children stand in a circle, sing this song and perform
 actions to the tune of "The Wheels on The Bus".

<p>The leaves on the trees come tumbling down,Tumbling down, tumbling
 down.(Children flutter their hands and fingers down to the floor
 each time the phrase 'tumbling down' is repeated)

<p>The leaves on the trees come tumbling down,All over town.(Children
 flutter hands down, then turn around)

<p>The leaves on the trees are red red red,Red red red, red red
 red,(Everyone wearing red clothes goes to the middle of the
 circle and shakes themselves)

<p>The leaves on the trees are red red red,All over town.

<p>The leaves on the trees are green green green,Green green green,
 green green green.(Everyone wearing green goes to the middle
 of the circle and shakes)

<p>The leaves on the trees are green green green,All over town.Repeat
 for orange and yellow leaves

<p>Leaf Classification Bar GraphThis preschool education lesson
 plan begins outdoors, takes advantage of Autumn's colors and
 encourages young children's classification and sorting skills
 as they work with concrete materials and compare amounts.

<p>You will need:Enough large paper bags for half the children in
 your group, tape, glue/glue stick, craft paper and a felt tip
 marker 

<p>In advance explain to preschool children that they will collect
 fallen leaves.  Remind children not to put leaves off plants,
 bushes or trees.  Only collect the leaves that have fallen on
 the ground.  Encourage young children to use the "buddy system"
 when collecting (two preschoolers share each collection paper
 bag).  As the children collect leaves teachers use descriptive
 words, "I see you've found 3 orange leaves" etc.

<p>Back inside the preschool classroom, during small group time,
 sort the leaves according to color, size or kind.  Together
 with young children count how many of each color, size or kind.
  Are there more brown leaves than green leaves?

<p>Creating a vertical bar graph will help children compare the
 leaves according to a classification category such as color
 etc. On craft paper teachers list the leaf colors.  Next ask
 children to tape or glue leaves in the appropriate color column.
  Display on children's eye level and refer to the bar graph
 often during the fall season.
