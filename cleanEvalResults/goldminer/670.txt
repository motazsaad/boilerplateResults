<l> Date of assessment (used to show the year when the assessment
 was done). Any assessments older than ten years will have an
 .out-of-date. flag. This is indicated on the web site by the
 letters .OD. in the Caveat field. The Caveat field is only present
 when there are out-of-date assessments. 

<l> An indication if a petition about the status of the species
 has been lodged and is pending a decision from the Red List
 Standards and Petitions Subcommittee (see http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/redlists/petitions.html).
 This is indicated on the web site by the letter 'P' as a flag
 in the Annotation field on the initial search results page.
 The Annotation field is only present when there is a petition.
 

<l> The Assessors field indicates the names of the people or organizations
 responsible for making the assessment and compiling the information.
 

<l> The Evaluators field indicates the names of the people who have
 peer reviewed and accepted the assessment and the supporting
 documentation. There is always a minimum of two evaluators (these
 may overlap with the assessors) and the name of the Red List
 Authority or organization they work for is indicated. 

<l> A justification for the listing (including any numerical data
 used, or inferences made, that relate to the thresholds in the
 criteria). This may include a link to a PDF file containing
 extra information. 

<l> Red List History (a history of global listings for the taxon
 concerned on the IUCN Red Lists and BirdLife lists . this is
 a work in progress). 

<h> Distribution is recorded in terms of country names following
 the 5th edition (and subsequent web updates) of the ISO-3166-1
 standard (ISO 1997). Unless geographically very remote from
 each other, islands and other territories are included with
 the parent country. In the case of species that inhabit islands
 significantly distant from the mainland, the island name is
 given in parentheses (e.g., Spain (Canary Islands)). The naming
 of such islands follows edition 2 of the  World Geographical
 Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions (Brummitt et al. 2001)
 prepared for the International Working Group on Taxonomic Databases
 (TDWG). The TDWG geographic system also provides a standard
 set of Basic Recording Units (BRU) that are sub-country units
 based on provinces or states. The BRU's are used to subdivide
 very large countries like Australia, Brazil, China, South Africa,
 the Russian Federation and the United States of America, etc.
 into smaller more conveniently sized units for recording distributions.
 This system has been adopted for the IUCN Red List wherever
 possible. Most plant taxa on the Red List have had their distributions
 recorded down to BRU level where appropriate, but unfortunately
 sub-country information is still lacking for most of the animal
 species. Hence this feature is not currently searchable. Each
 country or territory has also been assigned to a single geographic
 region to enable users to search by larger geographic areas.
 (View the list of Countries by Regions).

<p> Geopolitical events during recent years may have led to some
 inconsistency or errors in the distribution information provided.
 Within reasonable limits every effort has been made to determine
 which of the new nations that were part of the former Czechoslovakia,
 Yugoslavia and USSR support species previously attributed to
 the larger unit. There may be some species in the Red List that
 have still not been fully resolved. Adherence to the ISO system
 also creates some problems, as there is often a time lag between
 a political change and a new ISO code being allocated for the
 new country. The version of the ISO codes used for example,
 maintains Hong Kong and Macao as separate units. 

<h> For marine species, country records have been provided wherever
 possible. This information has been derived from a number of
 sources, e.g. FishBase and the many FAO publications. Any species
 without a country name in the Red List is not included in any
 of the analyses or tables presented. For some marine species,
 especially those that are most strictly marine, their distributions
 are also shown as generalized ranges in terms of the  FAO Fishing
 Areas, indicated as follows (e.g., Atlantic-eastern central).
 For many inland water species, usually those restricted to a
 single water system, inland water ranges are also given with
 a clear indication from the name if it is a river or a lake.
 In a few instances, a second river name (e.g. Colorado River,
 Concho River) indicates a section of the drainage in which the
 species occurs. In most cases, the countries in which these
 freshwater species occur are also recorded, but there are a
 few instances (e.g., cichlid fish in Lake Victoria), where the
 precise country distribution is unknown, so the only distribution
 information is the Lake name.
