<p>Land Tax is an annual tax based on land ownership and usage of
 land as at 30 June. Revenue from Land Tax is paid into the general
 revenue account of the South Australian Government, and assists
 in the provision of public services such as education, health
 and public safety.

<p>Who is liable for the payment of Land Tax?

<p>The owner of the property as at 30 June is liable to pay the
 land tax assessed for the new financial year. The owner is generally
 taken to be the person whose name appears on the Certificate
 of Title at the Land Titles Office.

<p>As Land Tax is calculated as at 30 June, the Notice for Payment
 will contain details of properties owned as at that time. Where
 a property was sold after 30 June, the vendor (seller) is still
 liable for the land tax. However, it should be noted, if the
 Land Tax is not paid at settlement it remains a first charge
 on the land and may be passed on to the purchaser.

<p> It is an industry based convention for the legal real estate
 contract to provide for land tax to be apportioned (based on
 a calculation of the single holding tax see single and multiple
 holding tax ) between the buyer and seller of land. 

<p>How is Land Tax calculated?

<p>The Land Tax Notice for Payment is calculated on the basis of
 the total site value of all land owned (either solely or jointly)
 as at midnight 30 June, excluding exempt land. (see what land
 is exempt from land tax)

<p>It should be noted that where an owner owns more than one taxable
 property, land tax is calculated on the total site value of
 all properties owned. (For examples of calculation of land tax,
 see single and multiple holding tax).

<p>What are the Land Tax Rates?

<p>Land tax is calculated according to the following:

<p>Rates effective from 1/7/2005 

<p>
Total Taxable Site Value 

<p>Rate

<p>Up to $110, 000

<p>Nil

<p>$110,001 - $350,000

<p>30 cents for each $100 or part $100 above $110,000

<p>$350,001 - $550,000

<p>$720 plus 70 cents for each $100 or part $100 above $350,000

<p>$550,001 - $750,000

<p>$2,120 plus $1.65 for each $100 or part $100 above $550,000

<p>$750,001 - $1,000,000

<p>$5,420 plus $2.40 for each $100 or part $100 above $750,000

<p>Over $1,000,000 

<p>$11,420 plus $3.70 for each $100 or part $100 above $1,000,000

<p>Single and Multiple Holding Tax

<p>The terms "single holding" and "multiple holding" refer to the
 apportionment of land tax amongst taxable properties within
 an ownership.

<p>Single holding tax refers to the calculation of land tax where
 there is only one taxable property in the ownership (see example
 below):

<p>Example - only one non-exempt land holding 

<p>Site value is $120,000

<p>Tax on first $110,000 = Nil

<p>$120,000 - $110,000 = $10,000 @ 30 cents per $100 = $30 

<p>Total tax = $30.00 

<p>Multiple holding tax refers to where more than one non-exempt
 property is owned. RevenueSA is required to apportion the total
 land tax payable to each taxable property within the ownership.
 The total land tax payable is therefore apportioned amongst
 each of the taxable properties in the ownership based on their
 value as a proportion of the total site value of the ownership.
 (see example below):

<p>Example - more than one non-exempt land holding 

<p>Site values are: 

<p>12 Smith St 

<p>$250,000 

<p>51 Johns St 

<p>$200,000 

<p>2/41 Queen St 

<p>$150,000 

<p>Total Site Value 

<p>$600,000 

<p>Tax on site value up to $550,000 = $2,120 
 Tax on $600,000 -
 $550,000 = $825.00 ($50,000 @ $1.65 per $100)

<p>Total Tax = $2,945.00

<p>Apportionment between properties:

<p>Tax for 12 Smith St

<p>$250,000 (site value)

<p>x $2,945 (total tax) = $1,227.08

<p>$600,000 (total site value)

<p>Tax for 51 Johns St

<p>$200,000 (site value)

<p>x $2,945 (total tax) = $981.67

<p>$600,000 (total site value)

<p>Tax for 2/41 Queens St

<p>$150,000 (site value)

<p>x $2,945 (total tax) = $736.25

<p>$600,000 (total site value)

<p>Total Tax = $2,945.00

<p>
Where land is sold and adjustments are made to account for land
 tax (see who is liable for the payment of land tax) the calculation
 of land tax to be apportioned between the seller and buyer must
 be based on the calculation of a single holding tax for the
 property concerned. By using the single holding tax, the adjustment
 is calculated as if the property being sold is the only taxable
 property in the ownership. 

<p>Why this may be your first Land Tax account

<l>The total site value of all taxable land owned by you as at 30
 June may have exceeded the general threshold level of $110,000
 for the first time;

<l> You may have bought additional land, or your land has been revalued
 in the last financial year;

<l> Land previously exempt may now no longer satisfy the exemption
 criteria.

<p>What land is exempt from Land Tax?

<p>Principal Place of Residence Exemptions:
 Land that is owned
 by a natural person and is used as their principal place of
 residence as at 30 June is exempt. A land tax exemption is available
 to natural person's for the land on which their principal family
 home is situated (caravans or tents are not regarded as a principal
 place of residence). 

<p>Properties that are the owner's principal place of residence
 and a business is run from the premises may also be eligible
 for a partial exemption provided that: 

<l>one of the registered owners lived at the property on 30 June;
 

<l>buildings on the land have a predominantly residential character;
 and 

<l>no more than 75% of the floor area of all the buildings are used
 for business purposes. 

<p>A 'natural person', means an individual and does not include
 a company (or other body), which is classed as an artificial
 person. The principal place of residence exemption is not available
 for companies or other organisations, even if the land is occupied
 by any of its shareholders or members.

<p>
 Land Tax relief may be provided under the following three scenarios:

<l>Where a person as at 30 June owns a property subject to land
 tax and occupies this property during the new financial year
 as their principal place of residence e.g., construction of
 a residence on vacant land. Application Form 

<l>
 Where a person is in the process of selling a home and as a
 result owns 2 properties as at 30 June, one of which is the
 current principal place of residence (and eligible for exemption)
 and the other is intended but not yet occupied principal place
 of residence (and liable for land tax). Application Form 

<l>
 Where a person purchases a property, which was taxable in the
 ownership of the vendor (seller) and is to be occupied as a
 principal place of residence, the purchaser may be refunded
 any proportionate land tax paid as part of settlement. Application
 Form 

<p>It should be noted that:

<l> Unless the Commissioner otherwise allows, no rental income can
 be received from properties during the period that homes are
 owned concurrently and the former residence must be sold before
 the end of the financial year. 

<l>Land Tax assessed will still be payable if the property was not
 your principal place of residence on or before the due date
 of your Notice for Payment. 

<p>If you would like to apply for exemption under any of the above
 scenarios, please download and complete an applicable Application
 Form and return it to RevenueSA. Please note all Applications
 must be submitted by 30 September of the year following the
 year of assessment. 

<p>Other Exemptions
 Exemptions are also available where land is
 used for the following purposes;

<l>Land which is used wholly or mainly for primary production purposes
 and primary production is the owner's main business;

<l>Land which is used wholly or mainly for religious or educational
 purposes;

<l>Land which is used for non-profit associations for the purpose
 of recreation for the local community, the preservation of buildings,
 the holding of agricultural shows or other specified purposes
 (charitable or sporting purposes).

<p>Applications for these other exemptions must be submitted in
 writing and forwarded to RevenueSA. 

<p>Does GST apply to land tax?

<p>Land Tax is included in the Federal Treasurer's determination
 under section 81.5 of A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax)
 Act, 1999 and is NOT subject to GST.

<p>How do I pay my Land Tax Notice?

<p>
 Details of the payment methods available are listed on our
 payments page.

<p>Penalties and Legal Action

<p>If your account is not paid by the due date, interest and penalties
 will be imposed on the unpaid tax.

<p>If the tax and penalty then remains unpaid, legal action may
 be commenced without further notice and you may be liable for
 any costs incurred.

<p>How is the value of my land assessed?

<p>The land/site value is determined by the Valuer-General. If the
 site value on the account differs from the previous year, it
 will be as a result of a revaluation by the State Valuation
 Office. 

<p>Formal objections regarding the valuations must be in writing
 served personally or by post to the State Valuation Office.
 Objections must be lodged within 60 days after the date of service
 of the first Notice served.

<p>
 PLEASE NOTE:

<l>The 60-day objection period starts at the date of the first Notice
 received. If you receive  further Notices under the Land Tax
 Act, 1936, the objection period does not change.

<l>You may not object to the valuation if the Valuer-General has
 already considered an  objection by you in response to another
 rating authority for this financial year.

<p>All queries and objections regarding the valuation of your land,
 should be directed to:

<p>State Valuation Office 
 GPO Box 1354
 ADELAIDE SA 5001

<p>What should I do if my Notice is wrong?

<p>If you think your Land Tax Notice for Payment is incorrect in
 any way, please return it to RevenueSA with an explanation of
 the amendments required. Please provide a daytime contact and
 telephone number in order to process your enquiry promptly.

<p>If you lodge an objection, your Land Tax Notice should still
 be paid in accordance with the due date shown thereon - any
 reduction in Land Tax resulting from the objection will be provided
 by way of refund.

<p>Trusts

<p>Where a property is owned by an individual or organisation on
 behalf of a trust, the owner(s) (trustees) can apply to have
 that property assessed separately from other land owned by the
 trustee in another capacity.

<p>
 To apply, please provide this Office with:&middot;

<l>A letter advising which property is owned on behalf of the trust.

<l>
A stamped copy of the relevant trust deed in its entirety.

<l>
Evidence to show that the property was purchased on behalf of
 the trust.This can be in the form of a stamped transfer document,
 settlement statement, minutes of the Trust meeting, contract
 for sale or financial statements of the trust. If financial
 statements are supplied the statements should identify that
 the property is an asset of the trust.
