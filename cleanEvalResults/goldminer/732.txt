 SPLITTING FILM 

<p> Since many film types were only available from the film manufacturers
 in 35mm stock, several submini camera manufacturers designed
 film splitters to allow cutting a smaller strip of film from
 35mm stock. With a film slitter, you can get some amazing film
 into your submini, such as 2475 recording film, B&amp;W or color
 infrared film, Tech pan, Agfapan 25 and Ektar 25.  Sometimes
 called film slitters -- and NOT to be confused with film SPLICERS
 -- these devices came in various styles to cut different size
 strips. Some cut a 35mm strip in half to produce two 17.5mm
 strips for cameras that used that size film. Others would cut
 16mm strips, 9.5mm strips and even 8mm strips. Some of the companies
 that made these slitters were GaMi, Minolta, Yashica, Ricoh,
 Mikroma, Microtec, Acmel, and Varitype. There are undoubtedly
 more. They basically work the same way. Using razor blades,
 of some type, they cut out smaller strips of film from 35mm
 film. These items are no longer being made and are very difficult
 to find. 

<p> If you want a ready-made slitter, we suggest you check out:

 If you prefer an older model, check out the SWAPMEET section
 of the SUBCLUB.   

<p> If you are handy or determined, you might even want to built
 your own slitter. All you need are a few small pieces of wood,
 a couple of razor blades, some basic tools, a little ingenuity
 and time.  Here are some pictures of a completed splitter. With
 this slitter, you place a bulk roll of 35mm film on the part
 that looks like a black handle. The film is pressed down onto
 the cutting block and a removeable pressure plate is screwed
 on top. Then the film is pulled through the slitter and rolled
 up on the other side. Two pieces of felt on either side of the
 film keep it from getting scratched. 

<p> You can use various materials in the construction of your slitter.
  The decision on material is up to you.  Wood is normally easier
 to work with if you just have standard tools, but other materials
 may offer advantages, if you are familiar with them and have
 the necessary tools.  In building your own slitter, one big
 problem you will come across is that the film is measured in
 millimeters, but American building materials are normally cut
 in inches. To complicate matters even more, when you add in
 the razor blades inbetween the wood blocks, the width is increased
 very slighly, but it can be enough to through off careful measurements.
 Here are some helpful measurements:

<l>
 3/8" wood = .375 inches = 9.525mm -- A piece of wood this thick
 will need to be sanded down somewhat to produce the size of
 the Minox film (9.2mm). 

<l> 5/8" wood = .625 inches = 15.875mm -- A piece of wood this thick
 (plus the added thickness of the razor blade) should be just
 right for 16mm film. 

<l> 11/16" wood = .6875 inches = 17.4625mm -- A piece of wood this
 thick (plus the added thickness of the razor blade) should be
 just right for 17.5mm film. 

<l> 1 3/8" wood = 1.375 inches = 34.925mm -- Pieces of wood that
 total to this thickness (plus the added thicknesses of the razor
 blades) should be just right for the total width of the 35mm
 film. 

<p>
 If you need just a little extra spacing, pieces of construction
 paper will probably work fine.  If you need a little less spacing,
 sand down the wood with fine sand paper, measuring as you go.
 

<p> Here are a few diagrams to use depending on the type and size
 of film you plan to slit.  The diagrams are NOT to scale.

<p>
 You can see from these diagrams is that if you only use one
 size of film to slit from (ex. 35mm) and one size of film to
 slit to (ex. 16mm) your job will be easier.  If you plan on
 slitting from different film sizes (ex. 35mm AND 16mm), or slit
 to different film sizes (ex. 16mm AND 9.5mm) your work is more
 involved.  You will need to make different film slitters or
 make a slitter with different slitting block pieces.  It's up
 to you to decide which is the best route to take. 

<p> Before you get started, here are few points to ponder.   

<p> Making a slitter takes time even if you are familiar with hand
 tools.  The measurements must be precise and the pieces of material
 are small, making cutting difficult.  It also makes it easy
 to cut yourself, so watch out! 

<p> The more planning you do up front the better your results will
 be and the easier the job will be.  The plans outlined here
 are generic plans and need to be modified depending on the type
 of film you plan to slit, the type of film you want to produce,
 the type of materials you plan to use and the features you want
 to built into the slitter.  You will first need to spend time
 designing your slitter using these diagrams as a starting point.
  If you have trouble designing your slitter, it's best not to
 build one yourself. 

<p> The amount of wood used in the project is very small.  Becasue
 of this you can probably afford to move up from a soft wood,
 like pine, to a harder wood, like oak.  Your slitter will last
 longer, but your saws and drill bits won't.  Harder woods are
 trickier to work with.   

<p> The SUBCLUB can assume no responsibility for the success of
 your splitter, nor for any damage you do to yourself or your
 camera during its construction or use.   In other words, you're
 on your own.  If you have the slightest doubt about building
 a slitter, you probably shouldn't built one. 

<p> If you are working with wood, the tools you will need are:

<l>
 electric drill and bits 

<l> screwdriver 

<l> hammer 

<l> sander and sandpaper 

<l> wood glue 

<l> C-clamps 

<l> saw 

<l> pliers 

<l> ruler 

<l> pencil 

<p> The materials you will need will vary depending on size of the
 slitter you make and the design and features you build into
 it.

<l>
 wood (see diagram to design and measure your own pieces) 

<l> screws (flat head will probably work best) 

<l> bolts (there are several kinds available) 

<l> wing nuts (to go with the bolts) 

<l> washers (to go under the wing nuts) 

<l> felt (available at any fabric store) 

<l> dowels (depending on your plans) 

<l> razor blades (many types are available) 

<p> If your are a Minox user, you can see some great plans on this
 site.
