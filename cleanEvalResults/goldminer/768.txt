<p>Housing Assignment Services staff creates homes away from home
 for UD students

<p>Ever wonder what keeps UD running smoothly? Up Close &amp; Personnel,
 a weekly feature, profiles the employees who keep UD ticking
 around the clock throughout the year. This week, the focus is
 on Housing Assignment Services.

<p>3:55 p.m., Feb. 1, 2005--With a staff of seven and more than
 7,200 students living on campus, Housing Assignment Services
 has a challenging job. All freshmen must live on campus unless
 they live with their parents or guardians, and all undergraduates
 who apply and meet application deadlines must be accommodated
 each year, according to director Linda Carey. 

<p>&#147;We have a small, close-knit staff, and we all work together
 to try to accommodate students&#146; housing needs,&#148; she
 said. 

<p>Housing Assignment Services has changed and expanded over the
 years, reflecting the ways the University itself has evolved,
 Carey said. There are different housing programs and opportunities
 for freshmen and undergraduates, such as LIFE (Learning Integrated
 Freshman Experience) clusters and special interest housing units,
 which are initiated by students, she said. (For more information,
 visit [www.ugs.udel.edu/gened/FYE_links.htm]).

<p>&#147;With modern technology, students also have different expectations
 and needs in their housing, and we work with Facilities and
 Residence Life to integrate what students require and want in
 housing and their residence halls,&#148; she said. Because they
 know what students want and need, the staff was asked for their
 input on the new residence halls that are being built now on
 the Laird Campus.

<p>&#147;We work closely with residence life, which occupies the
 second floor of our building, in helping students resolve any
 housing or roommate problems they may have,&#148; Carey said.

<p>&#147;We also see that housing regulations are enforced, such
 as no pets, except for service dogs and small fish aquariums,&#148;
 she said. 

<p>Computers have enhanced and streamlined Housing Assignment Services,
 according to Kirsten Brown who coordinates room assignments
 and has worked in housing for 15 years. 

<p>&#147;We used to ask three questions of students and then go
 through all the applications one by one to match students with
 similar interests. Now we can ask 11 questions, ranging from
 neatness to night and day personalities, and the computer compiles
 the information and links the likes and needs of students to
 help pair compatible roommates. Since we handle such large numbers,
 this is invaluable,&#148; Brown said. (For more student housing

<p>Martha Bailey, Jolene Moores and Kirsten Brown

<p>Jessica Matson, who has been at UD for nine months, is the meeter
 and greeter at the office&#151;the first person a student or
 parent sees upon entering the office. She said she enjoys her
 job even when it gets busy.

<p>Also on the front line is senior secretary Ruthie Riale, who
 has been on the job for three years. She handles administrative
 matters such as housing contracts and fields telephone calls
 from parents and students. &#147;Many students go online to
 sign up for housing, and computerization makes it easier to
 accommodate them. The second week of the semester is a busy
 time during open room change for students who wish to change
 room assignments,&#148; she said. 

<p>Jolene Moores, room assignment adviser, helps students with current
 housing problems and guides them in the right direction when
 making decisions about future housing arrangements. She also
 helps organize different housing options, such as the Friends
 Together program in Christiana Towers, where friends can live
 in adjoining apartments. 

<p>&#147;I get all kinds of questions from students and parents,&#148;
 Moores said, &#147;from where is Gore Hall to operating the
 washing machines in the dorms.&#148; 

<p>Moores, who&#146;s been working in Housing Assignment Services
 for more than five years, handles it all with a smile, trying
 to make sure that the needs of homesick freshmen and quarreling
 roommates are met. 

<p>&#147;We&#146;re not miracle workers, but we do try our hardest
 to accommodate each and every student,&#148; Moores said. 

<p>Martha Bailey, records analyst and coordinator, works on graduate
 student housing and also with sororities, such as Alpha Phi,
 whose building is owned and regulated by UD. There are 48 units
 for graduate students and their families at the Conover Apartments,
 she said, and Graduate Student Housing at 183 West Main St.
 &#147;I enjoy my job, and the graduate students are grateful
 and pleased with the facilities UD provides,&#148; Bailey said.
 

<p>Janette Humphrey

<p>Janette Humphrey is responsible for marketing and publications
 with housing information. From special housing events to brochures
 to e-mails and letters to parents, Humphrey uses all resources
 to get the word out about housing options. 

<p>&#147;Housing assignments are a major concern for many students,&#148;
 Humphrey said. &#147;In order to make the assignment process
 as convenient and accommodating as possible, we offer extensive
 information and instructions for current, prospective and transfer
 students and their parents. The more educated students are about
 their housing options, the better their chances of receiving
 their preferred housing location.&#148; (To view a sign-up guide
 for current students that details on-campus housing assignment
 processes, visit [www.udel.edu/has/on_campus.html].)

<p>Currently, Humphrey is preparing for this spring&#146;s Housing
 Fair, an annual event that kicks off the housing application
 period when students can send in their requests for the next
 year. This year the fair will be held from 11 a.m.-4 p.m., Tuesday,
 Feb. 22 in Multipupose Rooms A, B and C in the Trabant University
 Center. 

<p>The fair gives students an opportunity to ask questions, get
 one-on-one assistance with housing applications and view a presentation
 of campus residence halls, while enjoying refreshments and prizes.
 There also are information tables from other departments that
 are involved in campus life. 

<p>Prizes include the grand prize of a year of free housing and
 dining, other housing and dining awards, free University trips
 and UD apparel and merchandise. 

<p>&#147;We try to make the fair entertaining and appealing to students,&#148;
 Humphrey said. &#147;There are many benefits to attending the
 fair, and we want as many students as possible to take advantage
 of them.&#148;
