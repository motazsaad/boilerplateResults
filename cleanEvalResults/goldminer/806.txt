<h>Evaluating the Bologna Degree in the U.S.

<p>By Mariam Assefa, Executive Director, WES
 and Robert Sedgwick,
 Editor, WENR

<p>The first Bologna bachelor's degrees were awarded in 2003, which
 means that European students will soon begin using the new qualifications
 to gain entry to graduate-level programs in the United States.
 The Bologna bachelor's is (in most cases) a three-year, freestanding
 degree designed to prepare students for further study or employment.
 How then does this new degree compare with the traditional American
 bachelor's degree? At first glance, there are some fairly obvious
 similarities between the two: the nomenclature is the same,
 and both are terminal first degrees leading to either access
 to the job market or graduate study. At the same time, the degrees
 are quite different from one another, as we shall see. 

<p>In the last issue of WENR we presented an overview of the new
 Bologna bachelor's degree, comparing and contrasting it with
 the traditional first degrees in Europe. This article puts the
 Bologna degree up against the American bachelor's and illustrates
 how it will be evaluated when presented in the U.S. for graduate
 study. 

<p>The U.S. Bachelor's Degree 

<p>In the United States, institutions set degree requirements in
 terms of credits that are typically distributed over a period
 of four years. Each year is divided into semesters or quarters.
 The built-in flexibility of the system allows students to adjust
 the number of credits they choose to complete annually, so it
 is possible for students to earn their degrees in less than
 four years. They can also take longer than four years to complete
 their undergraduate education if they take fewer credits or
 attend school on a part-time basis. 

<p>Most bachelor's degree programs require the completion of a minimum
 of 120 semester credits drawn from three areas of study: general
 education, the major and electives.

<p>General education is unique to the American system of undergraduate
 education. It is generally known as "the breadth component of
 the undergraduate curriculum and is usually defined on an institution-wide
 or college-wide basis. It generally involves study in several
 subject areas and frequently aims to provide a common undergraduate
 experience for all students at a particular institution. It
 has been variously described as the necessary prerequisite for
 specialized study" (Levine 78). 

<p>Students are usually expected to complete their general education
 requirements early on in their undergraduate studies. Most undergraduates
 undertake these courses during their freshman and sophomore
 years before they begin to concentrate on a major.

<p>General education can be offered as either core curricula, distribution
 requirements or free electives. When it is set in the form of
 a core curriculum, general education consists of a set of common,
 broadly based and interdisciplinary courses usually required
 of all students and consist of subjects in the humanities, social
 sciences and natural sciences. Distribution requirements ensure
 that students complete their general education by taking a minimum
 number of courses or credits in specified academic areas drawn
 from the humanities, social sciences and natural sciences. Free
 electives allow students to take courses outside their major
 to fulfill the general education requirements. 

<p>The quantity of general education varies from institution to
 institution. However, on average between 40 and 60 percent of
 U.S. bachelor's degree programs are devoted to general education.
 The remaining credits are devoted to the major and related subjects.

<p>Comparing the Two Degrees

<p>Even though the Bologna Process has resulted in shorter degree
 programs that are defined in terms of required credits and introduced
 a two-tiered (undergraduate/graduate) system, the new European
 bachelor's is still quite distinct from its U.S. counterpart.
 Based on the sample "Bologna" bachelor's degrees we examined
 from Austria and Italy (see previous issue of WENR), it is apparent
 that the European degrees are more heavily concentrated in the
 major &#8212; or specialization &#8212; and that the general
 education component which is so crucial to U.S. undergraduate
 education is absent. The new degrees, awarded by traditional
 European institutions, are undeniably European in character.

<p>
 Below we have juxtaposed two programs for a bachelor's degree
 in business administration: one from Indiana University in Bloomington,
 and the other from the Bocconi University in Milan, Italy. 

<p>In the Italian program, courses in the major are taken starting
 in the first semester of study. The entire curriculum is devoted
 to business and related subjects including mathematics, computer
 science and foreign languages that are all taught in the same
 faculty. The sheer number of required courses in business and
 related subjects indicates that the program is heavily concentrated
 in the major, which is covered in great depth. 

<p>In comparison, the U.S. degree program includes subjects drawn
 from a wide range of disciplines to fulfill the university's
 general education and distribution requirements. The Kelly School
 of Business mandates that students who major in business "take
 at least 62 semester credits outside of business and economics
 coursework" in the different departments and faculties at Indiana
 University. Courses in the major and related subjects constitute
 50% of the 124 credits required for the bachelor&#8217;s degree.

<p>At the same time, the objectives and intended outcomes of both
 programs are remarkably similar as they aim to equip students
 with the tools and skills required for employment or for graduate
 education in their chosen field.

<p>The Kelly School of Business states that its graduates should
 &#8220;possess a broad-based knowledge of business and the business
 environment and the role that business plays in society; understand
 the national, international, political, social and economic
 environment that landscapes a firm&#8217;s operations; be able
 to articulate their thoughts orally and in writing and be computer
 literate; understand and incorporate ethical principles in all
 processes and decisions; possess an appreciation of the opportunities
 and problems involved in managing complex organizations; have
 the skills and capability to work effectively with others in
 the completion of joint tasks; possess the ability to find and
 formulate problems, think analytically, and recommend solutions;
 have the understanding and expertise needed to function effectively
 in an advanced technological society.&#8221; 

<p>The Bocconi program aims to "give students an understanding of
 the economic, financial, social, cultural, legal and technological
 foundations of business, and to equip them with the analytical
 and decision making tools that will allow them to manage different
 businesses in a changing environment. Graduates will be qualified
 for professional and managerial positions in marketing, sales,
 finance or human resources.&#8221; 

<p>The main differences between the two programs &#8212; the number
 of years of study, the amount of coursework devoted to the major,
 and the absence of general education from the Italian curriculum
 &#8212; reflect the distinct characteristics of each educational
 system

<p>The Evaluation

<p>The task for the credential evaluator is to examine the new qualification
 and determine whether it constitutes sufficient preparation
 for graduate admission in the U.S. To achieve that end, it is
 necessary to establish a coherent set of criteria that can be
 used for comparing the American and European degrees. The main
 criteria that World Education Services (WES) considers when
 assessing a degree are the level, structure, scope and intent
 of the program. Those factors are expressed in terms of: requirements
 for admission to the program; its contents and structure; and
 the function that the credential is designed to serve in the
 home system, respectively. After having considered all the relevant
 factors, WES regards the new three-year Italian laurea as functionally
 equivalent to a U.S. bachelor's degree.

<p>The number of years of study is merely one of the elements that
 define the structure of a program. In this particular case,
 the discrepancy in the number of years between the Italian and
 U.S. bachelor's degrees is outweighed by the similarities between
 the two programs. 

<p>Failure to recognize the Bologna bachelor's degree solely because
 it is a three-year qualification would leave U.S. graduate schools
 no choice but to reject candidates who apply for admission using
 these degrees, even when their records demonstrate that they
 have completed more than enough subjects in their discipline,
 have achieved the same skills and level of knowledge as their
 U.S. counterparts, and would very likely succeed at the graduate
 level. Such decisions would not only lack any academic merit,
 but they would also have profound and negative implications
 for international academic mobility. 

<p>CONCLUSION

<p>Academic credentials serve as recorded proof of an individual&#8217;s
 itinerary and accomplishments within a coherent and unified
 system of education. Credential evaluation exists first and
 foremost to facilitate the international mobility of students,
 scholars and professionals. This ideal is codified in the Convention
 on the Recognition of Qualifications Concerning Higher Education
 in the European Region, adopted in 1997 and signed by 41 countries
 including the United States. The Convention calls on member
 states to promote, encourage and facilitate the recognition
 of credentials earned outside of their borders to encourage
 the mobility of students and professionals. It also specifies
 that "Each country shall recognize qualifications as similar
 to the corresponding qualifications in its own system unless
 it can be shown that there are substantial differences." 

<p>To be effective, credential evaluation must examine the nature,
 structure and objectives of different systems of education and
 build the bridges that allow students and professionals to use
 their educational qualifications internationally.

<p>SAMPLE PROGRAMS

<p>Kelley School of Business (Indiana University)

<p>The bachelor's program at the Kelley School of Business provides
 a general-education component complemented by the study of business
 and economics. The application of this principle promotes a
 balanced program of study while it enables a student with an
 interest in a professional area of business to specialize in
 that field. 

<p>In addition, all undergraduate programs include courses that
 ensure the development of a basic understanding of the principles
 and practices involved in the management of business firms in
 the dynamic economic, social, and political environment of the
 world today. Four interrelated, rigorous junior-level courses
 in marketing management, operations management, financial management,
 and strategic management, known collectively as the integrative
 core, are required of all business majors. Consideration is
 given also to basic trends that are likely to shape the pattern
 of the business world in the years ahead. Beyond these basic
 requirements, students are given an opportunity to pursue studies
 from a wide variety of subject areas. 

<p>Graduates of the Undergraduate Program of the Kelley School of
 Business at Indiana University should have a general knowledge
 and appreciation of accomplishments in the physical sciences,
 arts, humanities, and social sciences; possess a broad-based
 knowledge of business and the business environment and the role
 each business plays in society; understand the national, international,
 political, social, and economic environment that landscapes
 a firm's operations; be able to articulate their thoughts orally
 and in writing and be computer literate; understand and incorporate
 ethical principles in all processes and decisions; possess an
 appreciation of the opportunities and problems involved in managing
 complex organizations; have the skills and capability to work
 effectively with others in the completion of joint tasks; possess
 the ability to find and formulate problems, think analytically,
 and recommend solutions; have the understanding and expertise
 needed to function effectively in an advanced technological
 environment.
