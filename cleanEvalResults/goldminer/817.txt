<p>Ok, this is getting tedious. It looks like I need to investigate
 writing some code to automating writing the inital part of these
 earthquake posts.

<p>At 9:21 this morning we had a 3.5 magnitude earthquake at almost
 the exact same location as yesterday evening&#8217;s quake.
 I was still lying in bed when this one hit. I felt a quick,
 thudding jerk to the right, followed by a series of smaller
 bumps that diminished in amplitude. It lasted for only about
 1 second. The direction of the initial movement was away from
 the epicenter. 

<p>
Just two days after our 3.7 temblor, another earthquake just
 struck tonight at 10:50 pm. This one felt a little weaker at
 our house, but it had more of a rumbling, rolling character.
 It seemed to last just over one second, with one loud thump
 followed quickly by several thumps of diminishing amplitude.

<p>It was also a 3.7 according to the USGS. When I first went to
 the page for tonight&#8217;s it was listed as a 3.6, but when
 I refreshed the page it had changed to a 3.7 after review by
 a seismologist. This quake was also 2 miles ESE of Berkeley,
 but it was 6.2 miles deep instead of 5.6 miles deep.
 Let&#8217;s
 hope the North Hayward fault is just letting off a little stress,
 and not warming up for the big one. 

<p>
Not a huge quake, but it was pretty close to us. The preliminary
 USGS report says it was a 3.7 at 7:12 pm 2 miles ESE of Berkeley.
 The epicenter was very close to the Claremont hotel in Oakland.

<p>I felt a couple of thumps over about 2 seconds. There was one
 relatively strong thump and a couple of mild ones. The only
 damage we know of so far at our house was one cookie sliding
 off a cookie sheet in the oven.
 I filled out the USGS survey
 indicating how strong the shaking was at my house. The Community
 Internet Intensity Map for this quake is available online.

<p>A friend who was still at the office in Alameda IM&#8217;d me
 immediately to ask if I also felt the quake. My wife called
 KALX and they didn&#8217;t feel anything there, even though
 they are much closer to the epicenter. Of course, the radio
 station is in the basement of a building on which a ton of money
 was spent on seismic retrofitting.

<p>Given how minor the quake was, I don&#8217;t think the seismic
 work we had done on our house this summer made much of a difference,
 but I&#8217;m still very happy to have had the work done.

Not a mad German, actually, but mad skills (I refuse to write
 skillz, damn it, I just did) demonstrated by a German woman
 from Universität Würzburg. She performs some amazing stunts
 while riding a fixie in a gymnasium. I&#8217;ve seen guys do
 some of this stuff on stunt bikes, but I think it&#8217;s a
 lot easier on a small bike that is built for stunts. Not that
 I would really know. My best stunt was doing a stoppie on my
 road bike while skidding through an intersection past the hood
 of a car that almost cut me off. Maybe that and fishtailing
 around a dog that ran directly in front of me in the street
 as I was coming down a 11 percent slope at about 35 miles per
 hour. Don&#8217;t tell my mother about either of those.
 I think
 she is performing at some kind of end of semester event at the
 university. I tried to understand the conversation in German
 at the beginning, but they weren&#8217;t talking loud enough
 for me to understand much of it.

In response to the notification from Avaya that my personally
 identifiable information may have been compromised, I decided
 to try the automated phone systems used by Equifax, Experian
 and TransUnion for adding a fraud alert to my credit file. All
 three automated DTMF/voice applications were pretty bad.

<p>Equifax

<p>The app used two significantly different male voices. What was
 really bad, though, is that the app played essentially the same
 long winded message in both voices informing me that Equifax
 would automatically request that Experian and TransUnion place
 a fraud alert on my credit file. You almost get the feeling
 they don&#8217;t want you to set up a fraud alert.

<p>The Equifax app also had the absolutely useless intro message
 of &#8220;Please listen carefully, as our menu options have
 changed.&#8221; Who would ever call this app enough times to
 have memorized the options? Also, when did the options last
 change? Yesterday, two years ago? About the only reason an app
 should have this prompt is if it is frequently used by power
 users and the options really have changed very recently.

<p>The app provided no confirmation of spoken digits, even when
 I intentionally spoke them quickly and slurred the numbers.
 When I slurred the digits so much that it didn&#8217;t hear
 all of them, I got a prompt indicating that the number needed
 to be ten digits.

<p>The app failed to place a fraud alert on my credit file, very
 likely due to the fact that it probably collected incorrect
 numbers that it failed to confirm with me so i could correct
 them.

<p>Experian

<p>The app was DTMF only, so there was much punching of digits on
 the keypad. This made the data collection process slower and
 more painful than for Equifax and TransUnion.

<p>The app started with a menu of options. Setting up a fraud alert
 wasn&#8217;t one of them. By stepping through several layers
 of menus, I finally got to the point where fraud alerts were
 mentioned.

<p>Along the way, I was offered the option to hear an eight-minute
 recording of California rights, since I called from a California
 area code. Neither Equifax and TransUnion offered this. I don&#8217;t
 know if they are supposed to, but I can pretty much guarantee
 no one will listen to it. Since Experian is paying the toll
 charges for the phone call, they don&#8217;t want you to listen
 to it, either.

<p>The app was very repetitive. It presented the same info in several
 ways. Many of the prompts repeated themselves. It was repetitious.

<p>One good thing about the app was that it used a single female
 voice for the prompts. The VUI design was not very good, though.
 The confirmation dialogs were particularly painful.

<p>Several prompts in, I was informed that to place a fraud alert,
 I would need to be transferred to a separate secure system and
 that I would not be able to return to the main menu. Which made
 me wonder, why did I start out in the insecure system? What
 made the secure system secure? It&#8217;s not like our conversation
 was suddenly being encrypted.

<p>The best thing about the Experian app is that I was able to use
 it to successfully add a fraud alert. It was a painfully slow,
 mind numbing experience, but it appears to have worked.

<p>TransUnion

<p>The TransUnion app started with a very specific fraud alert intro.
 It also used a single female voice throughout the app. Like
 the Equifax app it accepted spoken digits and yes/no, in addition
 to DTMF digits.

<p>The confirmation dialogs for digits were clunky &#8220;We captured
 one two three four five&#8221;, but at least they were there.
 I&#8217;m still wondering who the &#8220;we&#8221; was. I only
 heard one voice. Maybe it was the royal &#8220;we&#8221;.

<p>Summary

<p>The VUI for each of the apps appears to have been designed by
 someone with little experience in IVR application design. As
 far as usability goes, I would rank them as follows:

<l>TransUnion

<l>Equifax

<l>Experian

<p>However, I have to give Experian some extra points, because it
 was the only app that alowed me to successfully place a fraud
 alert on my credit file. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s hard to call
 any of them a winner.

<p>While plodding through these automated systems, I took the opportunity
 to clean up dead links and out of date info on my privacy and
 security page. 

<p>
I just received a letter from Avaya informing of the theft of
 an employee&#8217;s laptop that may contain my personally identifiable
 information (PII). The letter suggests that I contact one of
 Equifax, Experian or TransUnionCorp to have a fraud alert placed
 on my credit file. If you contact one, they will allegedly automatically
 contact the other two.

<p>While I&#8217;m glad to have received the notification so I can
 take action before something bad happens, I wish Ross Senholzi,
 Director, Finance, (or more likely, one of the people in his
 group) had spent a few more minutes proofreading the letter.
 One glaring error in the letter is the URL for filing a complaint
 with the FTC. Somehow I don&#8217;t think that www.consumer.gov/idtehft
 (sic) is the correct URL. Unless, of course, the people managing
 the website at the FTC can&#8217;t spell &#8220;theft&#8221;
 either. At least this is an obvious mistake that virtually everyone
 will correct if they type it into a browser.

<p>A far worse error is an incorrect number for Experian. The correct
 number is 888-397-3742, not 800-397-3742. In Avaya&#8217;s defense,
 lots of other people get this wrong, too. Search on &#8220;800-397-3742&#8243;
 and you will find a lot of sites listing this as the Experian
 fraud alert line. But they could have at least tried calling
 the number once.

<p>If you call 800-397-3742, you get an amazingly bad DTMF app.
 After a welcome message &#8220;Hello and thank you for calling&#8221;
 that never mentions Experian, you are presented with a one choice
 menu, &#8220;To hear how we can easily help repair your credit
 by removing negative or erroneous items from your credit report,
 please press 1 now&#8221;. If you don&#8217;t do anything, the
 prompt repeats. A few seconds later, the app hangs up on you.

<p>Here&#8217;s the rub, though. If you do press 1, you get a sales
 pitch from the &#8220;Consumer Information Bureau&#8221; for
 a paid service to repair your credit record. If you press 0
 to try to reach an agent, the app hangs up on you. The owner
 of this number appears to be some other company that has latched
 on to the fact that many websites have the wrong phone number
 for Experian. A reverse lookup on 888-397-3742 returned Experian
 as the owner of the number. A reverse lookup on 800-397-3742
 returned nothing.

Microsoft supposedly spent 18 months working on the 45 built-in
 system sounds for Vista. This may seem like a long time (and
 I guess it is), but I have yet to use an OS where I enabled
 the system sounds for any significant amount of time. It may
 not seem like a difficult task to come up with 45 short sounds,
 but they need to appeal to a lot of people, produce a cognitive
 association with a specific type of event, sound good on a wide
 array of sound production devices, etc.

<p>OS X has probably been the closest to acceptable to me. With
 previous Windows versions, I&#8217;ve usually turned off the
 system sounds within just a few days of turning them on. I&#8217;ve
 been trying out the standard set of system sounds with Fedora
 Core, but I&#8217;m not too enamored with them, either.

<p>I was pretty surprised to learn that Robert Fripp was hired by
 the Vista team to produce a lot of recordings, some of which
 were used to develop the four-second startup sound. It turns
 out that Brian Eno actually did some recordings from Windows
 95. I don&#8217;t remember any Windows 95 sounds being particularly
 Enoesque, but then I don&#8217;t remember Windows 95 very well
 at all, either.

If your web browser (this happened for very recent versions
 of Firefox and Opera for me) hangs within seconds after launching
 on Fedora Core 6, check in the System Monitor to see if a process
 called acroread is consuming virtually all the CPU cycles. Killing
 the process isn&#8217;t sufficient. A new acroread process will
 be started every time you launch the browser, presumably due
 to a browser plug-in. There is a solution, though:

<p># rpm -e acroread

<p>Fortunately, there are plenty of other options for viewing PDFs
 with Linux. 

<p>The KALX Fundraiser for 2006 runs through this Sunday. But don&#8217;t
 wait, call (510) 642-5259 to donate now. Yes, now. Hey, how
 can you possibly live without a t-shirt displaying an acorn
 radio lovin&#8217; squirrel? I like the fact that it actually
 appears to be a hybrid wombat-squirrel.
