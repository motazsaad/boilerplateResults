 once beloved and now forsaken. Check it out.

<p>The scoop&#8230;

<p>Everyone has a song that&#8217;s been ruined by an ex. Ruined
 Music is the place to talk about the music you&#8217;ve lost:
 the songs you can&#8217;t stand to hear ever again, that record
 she always played when she was over at your house, the band
 you went to see together a week before he called it quits, That
 Song that was on That Mix, the record that was playing the night
 you (fill in the blank), the album you got for a Valentine&#8217;s
 Day gift. But wait! You&#8217;ve got a story about a song that
 was ruined not by an ex but by a roommate, a bandmate, a former
 best friend, a bad trip, a teacher, or an ocelot? Great, we&#8217;ll
 take those too! Tell us your story. Feel better. Reclaim your
 record collection. Guidelines are here. 
 And hey, we&#8217;re
 on MTV.

 my breakfast kipper on my plate, when Sherlock Holmes joined
 me at table. Holmes was not in a jovial mood. His dressing gown

 specific about the guy doing the&#8230;

<p>Hey John&#8212;I got your voicemail. Or, I saw that I missed
 your call. I didn&#8217;t actually listen to your voicemail.
 I was at a shoot. For Desperate Housewives. Listen, I heard

 “So how are
 you going to spend your bonus, Bateman?” Price is already
 buzzed and I am still nursing my Finlandia as Courtney lights
 up at the mere mention of money.

 Like burnt-out coals,

 My snow blind eyes will not revive,
 And what

 Dear Friends

 As the holiday season approaches, our family would
 like to share news of the extraordinary changes and growth we’ve
 experienced this year. As many of you know, my husband Frank
 has been prone to embarrassing bouts &#8230;

 Christmas to you all! It sure is nice getting your Christmas

 It’s been an EXPLOSIVE 2004 for the Jones family. You WON’T

<h>Disquieting Modern Trends: Our Prescience Frightens Us Edition

<p>Little did we know, friends, that when we dropped goofy little
 Footnote #2 in our most recent missive (see: D.M.T.: Things
 That Should Work Better in an Age of Unprecedented Technological
 Mastery and Yet, Maddeningly, Do Not Edition) we were setting
 off a series of events that would shake up the world of what
 still passes for entertainment these days. We feel compelled
 to review the bidding and offer you&#8212;our ever-salivating-for-more
 public&#8212;a response commensurate to our position as cultural
 provacateurs à la mode. Without further ado&#8212;

<p>Will Layman & Chris Osmond are an old-fashioned comedy team in
 the tradition of Burns & Allen, Abbott & Costello, or Bush &
 Cheney. They cowrote the song &#8220;Jenny Bought Burritos,&#8221;
 which is the only hit song about Mexican food that you&#8217;ve
 never heard.

<h>Coming Soon(-ish)

<p>Mr. Josh Abraham, your humble coëditor, had been mostly absent
 from this site for much of the past year, busy making a moving
 picture (or &#8220;talkie&#8221; as the kids are calling them
 these days). The film, American Standard, is currently in postproduction,
 undergoing the exciting processes of color correction, sound
 mixing, and the occasional reshoot or pickup shot.* The rough
 cut was shipped off to the fine folks in Park City, Utah, last
 week. Please enjoy the teaser and the extended trailer, below.
 And, yes&#8212;investment opportunities remain available!
