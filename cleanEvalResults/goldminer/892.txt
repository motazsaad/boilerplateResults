<p>I live by a simple saying "Give a man a fish feed them for a
 day, teach them to fish feed them for life"

<p>
 So Im looking for fellow Aucklander's who would be willing
 to spend time teaching me what they know. I can read but learn
 best by been shown or having things explained person to person.

<p>
 Hell I have even rung proffesional people and offered to pay
 them but no one wants my money.

<p>

 I'd like to help, but obviously you really need to talk to
 someone in Auckland. I'm happy to talk with you on the phone,
 and I'll be in Auckland in December, so maybe we could meet
 up then. In the meantime, good luck! If you have a specific
 request, you can email me.

<p>There was a thread a couple of weeks back where several NZ people
 met up and got drunk and naked (or maybe I'm thinking of some
 other event!!!!) Maybe they just looked at and played around
 with at each others equipment (or maybe I'm thinking of some
 other event!!!!) 

<p>
 Anyway, seemed like a friendly bunch. I think there were some
 images in the people section. Be worth doing a seach on some
 keywords like ...erm ... NZ, or something. I know Wazza (username)
 was involved as he had a daft old lens and took some good shots
 with it. Search for his user name. Maybe one of them is near
 Aukland.

<p>Ah that would be our fine crowd, not sure about the drunk and
 naked stuff though? Anyway that group would be Moppie, Joseph,
 MThorpeDavies, ScottNZ, Wazza, and myself! Did I leave anyone
 else out? Anyway, we got together the first time a few weeks
 back, there have been a couple of less formal gatherings since
 then.

<p>
 I know I am all too happy to assist! I suppose it depends on
 who is closest, I know Moppie, ScottNZ and I are all out in
 the Pakuranga Howick area, Wazza is a westie (should be obvious
 from that lens  ).

<p>Hi Tony! I'm from Auckland (Eastern suburbs.) I've been taking
 photos almost all of my life, but quite a newbie to doing things
 the manual way -- thanks to digital cameras I don't have to
 worry about the cost of processing! 

<p>
 There are quite a number of photography clubs in the country.
 Have a look at: http://www.ivan.co.nz/ClubIndex.htm to find
 one nearest you -- there are 4 camera clubs in Auckland: Manukau,
 North Shore, Henderson, and Howick.

<p>
 I'm thinking of joining the Howick Camera Club (http://www.howickcameraclub.org.nz/index.html)
 as they meet 3 times a month... though I don't plan on being
 there that often  Have a look at their website to have an idea
 of their activities.

<p>
 Now, back to finding a job. It's a bummer when you're made
 redundant!

<p>Aha! another Easterner, Howick Camera Club is pretty good, although
 they do take things pretty seriously there, not so much the
 social aspect there. I went along for a while a few years back
 it was all rpint and slide back then, no digital, I hear things
 have changed now, and they are one of the top digital clubs
 inthe country. Toyed with the idea a bit since then.

<p>Im in Mangere. I guess my biggest problem is Portraits in our
 lounge at night. just cant seem to get the lighting right. I
 have a Sunpack 455 Tri flash with a white unmbrella, an assortment
 of other lights. Im getting better, but Im still missing some
 key in my understanding about light shutter speed a F stops.I
 know what they all do but Im waiting for that "eurika" "click"
 to go off in my head.

<p>
 I dont have a light meter / flash meter so to an extent im
 shooting in the dark (excuse pun. Night is the only time when
 my wife is able to be my model (mind you she did say last night
 I need to get a model, umm I dont think she would be happy with
 a 18yr old babe in the house).

<p>
 I cant post pictures of our shoots as the arrangement was she
 would pose but I was not allowed to let anyone else see them.
 So that makes it a little harder for people to help. I have
 to respect her wishes or get a 18yr old babe  ummmmmmmmm

<p>Hi Tony,
 I don't actually remember getting drunk or naked for
 that matter, but the guys on the outing are a great bunch and
 I'm sure will be able to help. Myself, I'm generally a portrait-free
 zone so not going to be much use to you - I have a 380EX but
 it gets very little use. Most of my photos' are landsacapes,
 aircraft etc where I have no control whatever on the lighting
 other than just turning up &amp; hoping it's okay!

<p>Hmmm, most of the portrait work I do is natural light only, as
 artifical light is a bit of an art form in itself. For now it
 might be best to try and use some bright normal lights, and
 compensate in the white balance. 

<p>
 It will be very difficult to control all that flash light without
 a flash meter though. You should be able to get something OK
 with one flash and a brolly.

<p>
 Can you post an example?

<p>
 Might be able to swing by at some point, nights are best for
 my busy scehdule!

<p>
 From your lens collection, I would pick the EF50, and stop
 it down a bit

<p>A get togather would be a great idea. Its funny I did some portrait
 pics last night, afterwards I wondered if I was any good at
 photographing people. I find my nature photos far better maybe
 its because im a nature person not a people person and it shows
 in my photography.

<p>
 Just a thought.
