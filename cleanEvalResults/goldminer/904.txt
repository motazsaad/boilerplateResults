 Hello, everyone! I'm the author of Second Chances? and I've
 decided to start another one -- a more realistic story. No,
 I am not going to discontinue my other one, I just wanted to
 try something different. Let me know what you think, okay? Ok,
 good. I hope you like this one as much as well. 

<p>You woke up staring straight at the bright white ceiling. The
 fan was on high, and you were wrapped in a crisp, clean, bleach
 white sheet. It seemed pretty dull, and you weren't even sure
 exactly how you got there. Not moving, you tried to remember
 everything from last night. Maybe if you nudged him, he'd tell
 you what happened. Maybe he wouldn't and he'd just freak out
 and leave you there, naked wearing only a thin layer of cotton.
 You weren't sure. You don't remember his name, you don't remember
 his age, you don't remember coming back to your hotel room last
 night. It was all a blur. You were finally in Cancun, Mexico
 for spring break and you managed to get drunk the first night
 you hung out with your friends. Amazingly, you didn't have the
 urge to throw up... no, not yet, at least. Your head ached,
 but you weren't sure if it was because of the alcohol the prior
 night, or because of the current situation you were in. His
 chest was bare, and his skin was ivory. His slow, deep breaths
 made you feel somewhat calm despite the thousands of thoughts
 in your mind. You felt that if you even batted your eyes, the
 eyelashes would tickle his skin, and he'd wake up in an instant.
 So you closed your eyes tightly and forced yourself to go back
 to sleep. It wasn't exactly working. What was the worst that
 could happen? You had no idea, you've never been in this predicament
 before. This was so out of character for you. Yet, maybe, to
 be optimistic, nothing happened. Maybe you just fooled around
 a tiny bit and fell asleep. Yea, right. You knew that sounded
 too good to be true. You thought a bit more about getting up.
 If he reacted badly by the waking of your hand, it probably
 would be no different than him waking up himself. You figured
 this was the best idea, because nothing was going to change.
 Yet, getting up meant that you were going to walk around without
 a sheet, or that you'd take the sheet and leave him sleeping
 naked. So many decisions for stupid actions, huh? You saw the
 towel on the armchair close to the bed from yesterday morning
 when you got back from the pool. Ah hah! You thought to yourself,
 slowing retreating from his masculine grip. You began to make
 your way off the bed, but sadly his grip tightened, and he pulled
 you back towards him. This time, you were pulled into his chest
 in such a way that you could see his sleeping face. His soft,
 yet masculine features. His messy hair that made you smile a
 childish smile. He was rather attractive, you admited, and he
 smelled good. You gave yourself a pat on the back for the fact
 that you at least woke up next to someone who did not look hideous.
 Then you thought about how you looked right now. Would he find
 you attractive as well? What if he completely regrets it? Well,
 you couldn't say you didn't regret it either. You were still
 not sure what had happened. Then, as if your thoughts of not
 wanting to be the one who wakes him up first were read, the
 phone began to ring. You hastily jumped from his arms and reached
 for it. Sitting on the edge of the bed, you answered. 

<p>
"Hello...?" You whispered.

<p>
"Hi, this is the morning wake up call you requested at check
 in." Some woman replied in a cheery tone.

<p>
"Uh, thanks. I'm up." You said, afraid to look behind you, and
 hanging up the phone.

<p>
"Am I dreaming?" You heard a voice ask.

<p>
You slowly looked backwards and replied "I sure do hope so!"

<p>
He sprang up so now he was sitting, and he covered his face
 in his hands. You grabbed your towel and begun picking up your
 clothes from the floor.

<p>
"O' my god..." He muttered. "I cannot believe it."

<p>
"I know, me neither. I'm sorry." You said sympathetically.

<p>
"No, I'm sorry! It was probably my fault, anyway."

<p>
"Why? Do you remember anything?" You asked intently.

<p>
"I remember what happened, I don't remember how it happened."
 He looked up and then straight into your eyes.

<p>
"Uh... I - I'm going to uh, get dressed in the bathroom." You
 stuttered, while heading towards that direction. You looked
 in the mirror and smacked yourself. You begun to get dressed
 and wondered why you didn't feel dirty; why you didn't have
 an urge to take a shower to rinse any kind of fingerprints he
 left on your body.

<p>
You were done getting dressed and you had to admit that you
 looked great in what you were wearing, and that's probably how
 it all happened. You made a mental note not to dress up this
 much to go out drinking. How could your friends just let you
 leave with some guy you didn't even know? You felt like killing
 them even though you knew it was entirely your fault and responsibility.

<p>
You walked out the bathroom and saw him fully dressed staring
 out of the balcony window.

<p>
"Nice view, huh?" You asked him, coming out while tying your
 hair up into a ponytail.

<p>
"Yea, really nice." He replied, looking you from head to toe.
 "The... the view, that is, of course."

<p>
"Um hmm, I love it here." You said, sitting down on the bed
 putting your shoes on.

<p>
"You come here a lot?" He asked, sitting right next to you.

<p>
"Well, I've been here twice, and I love this hotel. Particularly
 the jacuzzi's on the roof!" You exclaimed.

<p>
"Yea, I love those, too!" He said, with a twinkle in his eye.

<p>
You blushed a little bit and looked down at your pale pink manicured
 toes.

<p>
"Well, I guess this is it..." You said, getting up and walking
 to the door.

<p>
"I guess so." He said, following you.

<p>
You opened the door and no one went through it.

<p>
"What are you waiting for?" You asked, impatiently.

<p>
"What are you talking about? This is my room!" He snapped.

<p>
"What!? No it's not, this is my room! I get wake up calls in
 the morning!" You said.

<p>
"Me too!"

<p>
"Well, I left a towel on the armchair from the pool yesterday!"
 You said, walking into the bathroom and showing him the towel
 you took in there.

<p>
"Me too!" He said.

<p>
"Well, my room number is 308, and this is my black suitcase!"
 You said, showing him the suitcase and then opening the door.

<p>
The door said 306.

<p>
"Wow..." You said gasping.

<p>
"Yes, wow. That means, this is my room!" He said, with a sense
 of pride.

<p>
"So then, wait." You said, walking to a door in the middle of
 the room. "Keep this one unlocked, okay?" He nodded. You grabbed
 your purse off of his dresser and walked to the room right next
 to him, 308. You placed your purse down, walked to your door
 in the middle of the room, and surprise, surprise, there he
 stood.

<p>
"I guess we're connected." You said, with a sly smile on your
 face.

<p>
He started laughing, "Hmm, so maybe yesterday might not have
 been a mistake?" He asked, even though it seemed it was more
 so stated to himself.

<p>
"Maybe. I'm ***** *******." You held your hand out while standing
 in the door way.
