<p>Hello, we know you're still subscribed to this blog (9,000 of
 you are on Bloglines, for instance). So, please unsubscribe
 from this blog and come over and visit me in my new home at

<p>I should have been clearer. My new blog is over on WordPress's
 new hosted service, which is still in beta. I've been posting
 frequently over there. http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/

<p>I'm still playing around, though, and learning the new system.
 I'm also setting up a separate blog over on TypePad to learn
 that blog tool. And have yet another one over on DABU too.

<p>Oh, and of course, there's our book blog (which is also on TypePad)
 and the Channel 9 video blog, done on modified version of Community
 Server. So, I'm getting around to a variety of blog tools and
 services. I find I don't like a lot about all the tools. It's
 interesting to me that no one has really come out with a big
 blog breakthrough lately.

<p>I'm getting another demo of Flock tomorrow, too.

<p>Oh, and ou might check in on Channel 9. I just uploaded three
 videos, including my first Xbox 360 one, an interview with a
 Vice President in charge of half of our developer division (we're
 shipping Visual Studio "within days" I hear).
