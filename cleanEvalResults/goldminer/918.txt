<p>It doesn't take much poking beneath the surface to tap a potent
 brew of hostility between many a motorist and bicyclist in Seattle.

<p>As the songs say, we could all use a little more peace and brotherhood
 on the roads. In that spirit, we talked with drivers and cyclists
 about their perceptions of each other and why they do what they
 do.

<p>The sins of cyclists that seem to incense motorists most: running
 red lights or stop signs, going the wrong way down one-way streets,
 splitting lanes by riding between two lanes, changing lanes
 or turning without signaling, a holier-than-thou attitude.

<p>And, driver trespasses that stress out cyclists: failing to yield
 the right of way when turning left; not looking when turning
 right; opening the car door without looking (thus, giving a
 cyclist a painful "door prize"); failure to use turn signals;
 running red lights or stop signs; a holier-than-thou attitude.

<p>Drivers said many cyclists want to be treated like vehicles but
 don't want to follow the same rules. But drivers who respect
 traffic laws and the speed limit 100 percent of the time also
 are an endangered species. Many motorists were sympathetic to
 the risks cyclists face, and some cyclists excoriated their
 own for illegal moves.

<h>Behind the handlebars: Cyclists sound off about dangerous drivers

<p>Eric Heller commutes to work seven miles each way from Green
 Lake to Amazon.com on Beacon Hill. Heller has been hit twice
 in the past three years -- both times in the bike lane on Second
 Avenue when drivers turned into him. In what cyclists say is
 a common occurrence, one motorist drove off; the other drove
 down the block before returning to help. Heller had scrapes,
 bruises and a bent frame. 

<p>"So I don't ride in the bike lane anymore. I ride in the street,"
 he said, though he gets "the finger all the time." People yell,
 "Get into the bike lane. You're breaking the law." (It is not
 illegal to ride in traffic lanes.)

<p>Blings, a messenger who didn't want her real name used, said
 she feels some animosity from drivers. "I don't blame them.
 I'd be upset if I was driving around too," she said. "I think
 they're mad that we can get away with breaking traffic laws."

<p>Blings was recently hit by a woman who turned right into her
 bike, then drove off before checking on her. She was unharmed.
 

<p>She says she doesn't use arm signals and knows only one person
 who does. She runs stop signs and yield signs when it looks
 clear -- partially because it takes much more energy and effort
 to stop and restart the bike with muscles, unlike pressing an
 accelerator or brakes.

<p>And she won't sit behind a line of cars at a light, because that
 means sucking up exhaust. She rides to the front of the line,
 which infuriates some drivers. She also rides between lanes,
 which she says is a courtesy to not slow cars down. "We feel
 comfortable riding down those lanes, and people can pass us
 on either side."

<p>Cyclist Joseph Sheedy, who uses a bike to go everywhere and owns
 10 to 20 bikes, says he sometimes splits lanes too. "That definitely
 provokes strong emotions from people." 

<p>He said he's safety-conscious in an aggressive way, usually riding
 between 20 and 25 mph.

<p>"Speed is safety," he said. "If I can stay at or near the speed
 limit, I should have the complete right to be in the middle
 of the lane. It's mostly to increase our visibility to motorists
 and control the situation around me."

<p>Sheedy, like many cyclists, is wary of riding at the right edge
 of a lane when there's no shoulder or bike lane, because many
 drivers try to pass with razor-thin, heart-stopping margins.

<p>A few weeks ago, Sheedy says he was deliberately hit from behind
 by a driver in the University District at a slow speed. He wasn't
 hurt, but stopped to call police. After yelling at him and referring
 to cyclists as "hippies of the road," the driver left, but was
 later visited at her home by an officer. "She just didn't like
 the fact that I was slowing her down 5 mph," Sheedy said. "There's
 definitely a strong us vs. them mentality there."

<p>He says he can't criticize others since he bends the law, but
 hopes drivers understand the seriousness of piloting a 2,000-pound
 vehicle around bikes. "I think a lot of motorists don't really
 understand the consequences for cyclists of not using their
 turn signals or opening their door without looking."

<p>Nick Spang, a 29-year-old graduate student, said it's not fair
 for cyclists to follow rules that were designed for cars. 

<p>"They never had the vulnerabilities or capabilities of bicyclists
 in mind when they created those rules," said Spang, who sits
 on the city's Bicycle Advisory Board, but whose views do not
 reflect the board's. "Bicyclists are small and can't cause the
 same amount of damage."

<p>Spang, who has been the victim of a hit-and-run collision with
 a car, says drivers don't treat bicyclists with the same respect
 as they do other cars. "If a big truck is in the middle of the
 road doing 5 mph, the cars will wait. But if a cyclist was doing
 the same, he'd probably get run down or yelled at," Spang said.
 "People would not accept it."

<h>Behind the wheel: Drivers sound off about reckless cyclists

<p>Rob Neilson, 60, is fed up with cyclists ignoring laws. "It's
 like they have some moral, pure-of-heart right because they
 are not using gasoline that they can do anything they want,"
 said Neilson, of Capitol Hill.

<p>"I know stopping at every stop sign is a pain, but my God, the
 car behind you is stopping at every one," he said. "Don't even
 get me started about bicyclists talking on cell phones."

<p>Neilson, a freelance stage manager, says he doesn't believe that
 drivers are breaking the law as much as cyclists. "If cars were
 disobeying the rules of the road as much as bicyclists, there'd
 be carnage out there," he said.

<p>Neilson's bottom line is one that many drivers share -- for cyclists
 to err on the side of caution: "Go with the side of physics.
 Your 80-pound titanium is going to lose when you hit the smallest
 compact, right or wrong."

<p>Alana Sorem sees cyclists going the wrong way down one-way streets,
 but what frustrates the part-time Metro bus driver most is cyclists
 riding in the "bus only" lane on Bothell Way. 

<p>"Double solid yellow lines mean 'do not pass,' except, apparently,
 for bicyclists," she said.

<p>She said when she comes around a blind curve on a hill going
 40 mph in a 60-foot-long bus, she sometimes finds a cyclist
 going 10 mph. "I veer into the other lane to avoid hitting them
 sometimes. I have to slam on the brakes and the passengers are
 jostled," said Sorem. 

<p>She's spoken to a few about this, but was flipped off once and
 ignored other times. 

<p>Mike Bishop, 33, drives more than an hour each way from Gold
 Bar to Ballard for work and worries most about not seeing cyclists
 at night. 

<p>"I've almost hit a couple that had no tailights, headlights or
 reflective clothing at night," said Bishop, who works at a seafood
 wholesaler. "You can't see them until you practically run them
 over." 

<p>He thinks people on bikes should have flashing front and rear
 lights for night riding.

<p>He admits he once hit a cyclist who was turning right -- because
 he didn't look. The bicyclist was unharmed.

<p>Bishop used to bike a lot himself. "It's great for their health
 and for the environment and to get more cars off the roads,"
 he said. But, he's loathe to do it now. "I'm just too afraid
 to even try and ride on the roads." 

<p>Brandon Adkins feels similarly. An occasional recreational rider,
 Adkins, 27, says: "I'm too chicken to ride on the street. I
 ride on the trails." 

<p>Like others, he sees cyclists ignoring laws.

<p>He's irked when cyclists ride to the front at a stoplight, and
 then drivers who just passed them must now pass them again.
 "It's kind of annoying, because it backs up all that traffic.
 It seems like they're causing a big delay."

<p>He's seen people honk at cyclists or pass them aggressively and
 thinks that's wrong too. "Everybody's guilty. Just as many motorists
 as cyclists will disobey traffic laws," said Adkins. 

<p>Tessa Dul, who lives on Capitol Hill, agrees with that. Dul,
 30, sees cyclists run red lights on a hilly overpass to downtown
 and worries because drivers can't see them on parts of the hill.
 "If it were me -- knowing that I had less steel around me --
 I'd err on the side of not getting hit."

<h>RULES OF THE ROAD FOR CYCLISTS

<p>Cyclists have the same rights and duties as drivers of cars,
 with a few exceptions.

<l>Both must follow the speed limit and exercise care not to hit
 pedestrians. Both must use turn signals -- blinkers for cars;
 hand signals for cyclists.

<l>Pass to the left of another car or bicycle at a safe distance.

<l>Cyclists going at a speed slower than the flow of car traffic
 are asked to ride as near to the right side of the right lane
 as is safe (they also may ride in the left part of the left-most
 lane on a one-way street with two or more lanes).

<l>Cyclists may ride two abreast in roads or on sidewalks. 

<l>Cyclists using the sidewalk must ride in a "careful and prudent
 manner" and yield the right of way to pedestrians as well as
 give them an audible sign before passing.

<l>Cyclists must yield to pedestrians in and along a crosswalk.

<l>One hand should be on the handlebars of a bike at all times.

<l>Helmets are required by city law for cyclists.

<l>In the dark, bicycles must have a lamp on the front visible from
 at least 500 feet and a red reflector on the rear visible up
 to 600 feet from behind (they can also use a red light).
