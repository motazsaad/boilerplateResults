 (DOROTHY) 
 When all the world is a hopeless jumble 
 And the
 raindrops tumble all around 
 Heaven opens a magic lane 
 When
 all the clouds darken up the skyway 
 There's a rainbow highway
 to be found 
 Leading from your window pane 
 To a place behind
 the sun 
 Just a step beyond the rain 

<p>
 Somewhere over the rainbow way up high 
 There's a land that
 I've heard of once in a lullaby 
 Somewhere over the rainbow
 skies are blue 
 And the dreams that you dare to dream 
 Really
 do come true 

<p>
 Some day I'll wish upon a star 
 And wake up where the clouds
 are far behind me 
 Where troubles melt like lemon drops 
 Away
 above the chimney tops 
 That's where you'll find me 

<p>
 Somewhere over the rainbow blue birds fly 
 Birds fly over
 the rainbow 
 Why then, oh why can't I? 
 If happy little bluebirds
 fly beyond the rainbow 
 Why oh why can't I? 

<p>
 (Glinda) 
 Come out, come out wherever you are 
 And meet the
 young lady who fell from a star 
 She fell from the sky, she
 fell very far 
 And Kansas she says is the name of the star
 

<p>
 (Munchkins) 
 Kansas she says is the name of the star 

<p>
 (Glinda) 
 She brings you good news, or haven't you heard 

 When she fell out of Kansas a miracle occurred 

<p>
 (Dorothy) 
 It really was no miracle 
 What happened was just
 this: 
 The wind began to switch the house to pitch 
 And suddenly
 the hinges started to unhitch 
 Just then the witch, to satisfy
 an itch 
 Went flying on her broomstick thumbing for a hitch
 

<p>
 (Munchkin Man) 
 And oh what happened then was rich 

<p>
 (Munchkins) 
 The house began to pitch, the kitchen took a
 slitch 
 It landed on the wicked witch in the middle of a ditch
 
 Which was not a healthy situation for the wicked witch 

<p>
 The house began to pitch, the kitchen took a slitch 
 It landed
 on the wicked witch in the middle of a ditch 
 Which was not
 a healthy situation for the wicked witch 
 Who began to twitch,
 and was reduced to just a stitch 
 Of what was once the wicked
 witch 

<p>
 (Munchkin 1) 
 We thank you very sweetly for doing it so neatly
 

<p>
 (Munchkin 2) 
 You've killed her so completely 
 That we thank
 you very sweetly 

<p>
 (Glinda) 
 Let the joyous news be spread 
 The wicked, old
 witch at last is dead 

<p>
 (Munchkins) 
 Ding-dong the witch is dead 
 Which old witch?
 The wicked witch 
 Ding-dong the wicked witch is dead 
 Wake
 up you sleepyhead 
 Rub your eyes, get out of bed 
 Wake up
 the wicked witch is dead 
 She's gone where the goblins go 

 Below - below - below 
 Yo-ho, let's open up and sing and ring
 the bells out 
 Ding Dong' the merry-oh, sing it high, sing
 it low 
 Let them know the Wicked Witch is dead 

<p>
 (Mayor) 
 As mayor of the Munchkin City 
 In the county of
 the land of Oz 
 I welcome you most regally 

<p>
 (Judge) 
 But we've got to verify it legally 
 To see... 

<p>
 (Mayor) 
 To see... 

<p>
 (Judge) 
 If she... 

<p>
 (Mayor) 
 If she... 

<p>
 (Judge) 
 Is morally, ethically 

<p>
 (Munchkin 1) 
 Spiritually, physically 

<p>
 (Munchkin 2) 
 Positively, absolutely 

<p>
 (Munchkin Men) 
 Undeniably and reliably dead 

<p>
 (Coroner) 
 As Coroner , I thoroughly examined her 
 And she's
 not only merely dead 
 She's really most sincerely dead 

<p>
 (Mayor) 
 Then this is a day of independence for all the munchkins
 
 And their descendants 
 Yes, let the joyous news be spread
 
 The wicked old witch at last is dead 

<p>
 (Munchkins) 
 Ding-dong the witch is dead 
 Which old witch?
 The wicked witch 
 Ding-dong the wicked witch is dead 
 Wake
 up you sleepyhead 
 Rub your eyes, get out of bed 
 Wake up
 the wicked witch is dead 
 She's gone where the goblins go 

 Below - below - below 
 Yo-ho, let's open up and sing and ring
 the bells out 
 Ding Dong' the merry-oh, sing it high, sing
 it low 
 Let them know the Wicked Witch is dead 

<p>

 You're off to see the Wizard, the Wonderful Wizard of Oz 

 You'll find he is a Whiz of a Wiz if ever a Wiz there was 

 If ever, oh ever, a Wiz there was the Wizard of Oz is one because
 
 Because, because, because, because, because 
 Because of the
 wonderful things he does 
 You're off the see the wizard, the
 Wonderful Wizard of Oz 

<p>
 (Scarecrow) 
 I could wile away the hours 
 Conferrin' with
 the flowers 
 Consultin' with the rain 
 And my head I'd be
 scratchin' 
 While my thoughts were busy hatchin' 
 If I only
 had a brain 

<p>
 I'd unravel any riddle 
 For any individ'le 
 In trouble or
 in pain 

<p>
 (Dorothy) 
 With the thoughts you'd be thinkin' 
 You could
 be another Lincoln 
 If you only had a brain 

<p>
 (Scarecrow) 
 Oh, I would tell you why 
 The ocean's near the
 shore 
 I could think of things I never thunk before 
 And then
 I'd sit and think some more 

<p>
 I would not be just a nuffin' 
 My head all full of stuffin'
 
 My heart all full of pain 
 I would dance and be merry 
 Life
 would be a ding-a-derry 
 If I only had a brain 

<p>
 We're off to see the Wizard 
 The Wonderful Wizard of Oz 

 We hear he is a Whiz of a Wiz 
 If ever a Wiz there was 
 If
 ever, oh ever, a Wiz there was 
 The Wizard of Oz is one because
 
 Because, because, because, because, because 
 Because of the
 wonderful things he does 
 We're off the see the wizard 
 The
 Wonderful Wizard of Oz 

<p>
 (Tin Man) 
 When a man's an empty kettle 
 He should be on
 his mettle 
 And yet I'm torn apart 
 Just because I'm presumin'
 
 That I could be kind of human 
 If I only had a heart 

<p>
 I'd be tender, I'd be gentle 
 And awful sentimental 
 Regarding
 love and art 
 I'd be friends with the sparrows 
 And the boy
 that shoots the arrows 
 If I only had a heart 

<p>
 Picture me a balcony 
 Above a voice sings low 

<p>
 (Snow White) 
 Wherefore art thou, Romeo? 

<p>
 (Tin Man) 
 I hear a beat, how sweet! 

<p>
 Just to register emotion, jealousy, devotion 
 And really feel
 the part 
 I could stay young and chipper 
 And I'd lock it
 with a zipper 
 If I only had a heart 

<p>
 (Cowardly Lion) 
 Yeah, it's sad, believe me Missy 
 When you're
 born to be a sissy 
 Without the vim and verve 
 But I could
 show my prowess 
 Be a lion, not a mowess 
 If I only had the
 nerve 

<p>
 I'm afraid there's no denyin' 
 I'm just a dandylion 
 A fate
 I don't deserve 
 I'd be brave as a blizzard 

<p>
 (Tin Man) 
 I'd be gentle as a lizard 

<p>
 (Scarecrow) 
 I'd be clever as a gizzard 

<p>
 (Dorothy) 
 If the Wizard is a wizard who will serve 

<p>
 (Scarecrow) 
 Then I'm sure to get a brain 

<p>
 (Tin Man) 
 A heart 

<p>
 (Dorothy) 
 A home 

<p>
 (Cowardly Lion) 
 The nerve 

<p>
 You're out of the woods 
 You're out of the dark 
 You're out
 of the night 
 Step into the sun, step into the light 
 Keep
 straight ahead 
 For the most glorious place 
 On the Face of
 the Earth 
 Or the sky 

<p>
 Hold onto your breath 
 Hold onto your heart 
 Hold onto your
 hope 
 March up to the gate 
 And bid it open 

<p>
 (Ozians) 
 Ha, ha, ha 
 Ho, ho, ho 
 And a couple of tra -
 la - las 
 That's how we laugh the day away 
 In the Merry Old
 Land of Oz 

<p>
 Bzz, bzz, bzz 
 Chirp, chirp, chirp 
 And a couple of la -
 di - das 
 That's how the crickets crick all day 
 In the Merry
 Old Land of Oz 

<p>
 We get up at twelve 
 And start to work at one 
 Take an hour
 for lunch 
 And then at two we're done 
 Jolly good fun! 

<p>
 Ha, ha, ha 
 Ho, ho, ho 
 And a couple of tra - la - las 

 That's how we laugh the day away 
 In the merry old land of
 Oz 

<p>
 Ha, ha, ha 
 Ho, ho, ho 
 Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha 
 That's how we
 laugh the day away 
 In the merry old land of Oz 

<p>
 (Scarecrow's Beauticians) 
 Pat, pat here, pat, pat there 

 And a couple of brand new straws 
 That's how we keep you young
 and fair 
 In the merry Old Land of Oz 

<p>
 (Tin Man's Beauticians) 
 Rub, rub here, Rub, rub there 
 Whether
 you're tin or brass 
 That's how we keep you in repair 
 In
 the Merry Old Land of Oz 

<p>
 (Dorothy's Beauticians) 
 We can make a dimple smile 
 Out
 of a frown 

<p>
 (Dorothy) 
 Can you even dye my eyes 
 To match my gown? 

<p>
 (Beautician) 
 Uh-huh! 

<p>
 (Dorothy) 
 Jolly Old town! 

<p>
 (Lion's Beauticians) 
 Clip, clip here, clip, clip there 

 We give the roughest claws 

<p>
 (Lion) 
 That certain air of savoir faire 
 In the Merry Old
 Land of Oz 
 Ha! 

<p>
 (Scarecrow) 
 Ha, ha, ha 

<p>
 (Tin Man) 
 Ho, ho, ho 

<p>
 (Dorothy) 
 Ha, ha, ha, ha 

<p>
 (Lion) 
 Ha! 

<p>
 (All) 
 That's how we laugh the day away 
 In the Merry Old
 Land of Oz 
 How we laugh the day away
