<p>The study of bundling can be approached from a variety of perspectives,
 such as information processing, transaction cost analysis, and
 competitive advantage. Specific research topics include how
 consumers select between competing bundles (i.e., how information
 processing differs when compared to selecting between individual
 products), the role of bundling in reducing churn in the marketplace,
 and the optimal configuration of the bundle (the number of products
 in the bundle as well as the relationship between the products
 in the bundle)

<p>
 In recent years firms have realized that they can leverage
 their value chains and achieve payoffs such as lower coordination
 costs, greater market access, and the delivery of quality service
 by initiating, developing, and enhancing long-term cooperation
 relationships with suppliers, distributors, and customers. A
 sampling of research areas in this field include, relationship
 initiation strategies through the use of market-place signals
 and social/structural bonds, relationship termination strategies
 involving hostages, idiosyncratic (specific) investments, and
 switching costs, etc.

<p>
 The area of information processing borrows heavily from psychology
 as well as economics. In recent years, research has focused
 on dynamic aspects of consumer preference (i.e., how choices
 and preferences change over time), information acquisition and
 use in Judgments (i.e., how people search for information and
 use information in their decisions), advertising exposure and
 attitude change (how attitudes are affected by advertising),
 and customer satisfaction and loyalty.

<p>This is an area of immense importance to marketing managers and
 research in this field requires an understanding of areas outside
 of traditional marketing such as economics (e.g., game theory)
 and finance (Capital Asset Pricing Models). One area of study
 is the wireless telecommunications industry. In this area, one
 could potentially research how consumers adopt new tecnologies,
 how should the different telecommunication services be optimally
 priced given that there are strong cross elasticity across services,
 and what is the optimum service portfolio.

<p>
 The study of judgment and decision making is rooted in Behavioral
 Decision Theory, or BDT, which studies how consumers form judgments
 and make choices in the marketplace. It is often described as
 a descriptive alternative to the more normative economic theories
 of rational choice. In the marketing context, BDT is applied
 in areas such as (1) the introduction of new products and services,
 (2) judgment and decision making among multi-attribute options,
 (3) the influence of market signals on price and quality perceptions,
 and (4) the impact of description frames on communication and
 personal selling.

 Independent Study

<p>Year 3:

<p>All marketing students will generally need a strong quantitative
 background even if their ultimate dissertation is in a behavioral
 area. Multiple courses in methodology including econometrics,
 multivariate analysis, discrete choice modeling, and experimental
 design will be needed. Some of these courses will be offered
 in the School, while others can be taken in the economics, political
 science and psychology departments. 

<p>The Marketing area has graduated two Ph.D. students. David Reid,
 is a Professor at the University of Toledo. He examined the
 dynamics of group decision making in Buying Centers. Cynthia
 Cann is an Associate Professor at the University of Scranton.
 She investigated the diffusion and buying practices in organizations
 purchasing mainframe computers. Her dissertation was funded
 by IBM.
