<p>IN A.D.1194, Richard I of England introduced the Cross of St.
 George as the Standard of England, and this remained the national
 flag until the Union with Scotland. In 1603, King James VI of
 Scotland became James I of England, as a result of which the
 first Union Jack was formed in 1606 by the addition of the Cross
 of St. Andrew which formed the background of the new flag. The
 name "Union Jack" came from King James, whose name is "Jacobus"
 in Latin, and "Jacob" in Hebrew. Then in 1801, there was formed
 the more familiar Union Jack by the addition of the Cross of
 St. Patrick, sandwiched in between the flagsof Scotland and
 England. Thus the formation of the Union Jack came about as
 the result of the progressive merging of the inhabitants of
 the British Islesunder one throne, the throne of David. The
 completed Union Jack thus symbolises the RE-UNION OF JACOB.
 

<p>The three covenants are symbolised by the three flags which together
 form the Union Jack. 

<p>We have been studying how God made three covenants with His people,
 the fulfilment of which in the Anglo-Saxon race proves that
 it is Israel. It is remarkable that if we take the three flags
 in the order in which they form the Union - Scotland, Ireland,
 and England - then the three flags symbolise the three covenants
 in the order God made them with Israel. For the sake of illustrating
 this, a chart of the three covenants (Chart 2) is shown after
 the flags (Chart 1) and in corresponding order. 

<p> 

<p>The first chart shows the selection of Abraham to be the father
 of the specially trained race who would teach therest of humanity
 how to overcome disease and finally death. The mind of Abraham
 looked forward like a searchlight to the "latter days," when
 the many promises made to him concerning his seed would be fulfilled.
 In the corresponding flag of St. Andrew which forms the base
 of the Union Jack, the blue background indicates that the power
 behind the destiny of Abraham and his seed was a heavenly or
 spiritual one, and that thechosen race would eventually become
 such a people. The white cross is the sign of multiplicity and
 symbolises Jacob's summing up of the Abrahamic promises as he
 passed them on to Ephraim and Manasseh with his arms crossed,
 and his hands upon their heads.

<p>SCOTLAND-ST. ANDREW

<p>             

<p>THE ABRAHAMIC COVENANT

<p>With his hands crossed, Jacob passed on the blessings of national
 greatness to Manasseh and Ephraim. 

<p>         

<p>IRELAND-ST. PATRICK

<p>THE MOSAIC OR OLD COVENANT

<p>which was broken by Israel; the blessings postponed 2,520 years,
 the need of a Saviour. 

<p> 

<p>    ENGLAND-ST. GE0RGE

<p>THE NEW COVENANT OF REDEMPTION 

<p>The second chart shows the first stage in God's education of
 His servant race by the revelation of the details of His law
 and righteousness in all phases of life. God promised that if
 Israel kept the terms of the Mosaic Law Covenant, she would
 then be fit to bless the world as He had promised her fathers.
 At that same time, He warned Israel that the BREAKING of the
 laws in the Covenant would lead to the long period of scattering
 for "seven times."We know that Israel did break the Law and
 sinned against God, thus showing their weakness and inability
 to rise to the high standard set. They learnt the bitter lesson
 of their own sinful nature and of the impossibility of becoming
 God's servant without supernatural aid. 

<p>When the flag of St. Patrick was added in 1801 to form the Union,
 it was broken in the middle in order to leave a white border
 showing between the red cross and the blue background. The broken
 cross, of course, remarkably signified that Israel broke this
 agreement with God. It showed Israel as a defective people,
 whose sin and transgressions were evidenced by their failure
 to keep God's Law. It taught Israel the need of an outside Divine
 aid to mend their own broken lives - the need of a new creation.
 The Mosaic Covenant reminded Israel all the time of BROKENNESS,
 lack of perfection, and it developed in Israel A NATIONAL CONSCIENCE
 OF RIGHT AND WRONG WHICH TO-DAY DISTINGUISHES ANGLO-SAXON PEOPLE
 FROM ALL OTHER NATIONS. The fact that the cross is RED typifies
 blood. God allowed certain transgressions of His Law to be forgiven,
 provided that Israel sacrificed various animals in death. The
 animal thus suffered death INSTEAD OF the Israelite. Yet those
 animal sacrifices went on from year to year and never overcame
 human depravity which caused death. But through the sacrifices,
 God gradually revealed His purpose that some day ONE SACRIFICE
 would be paid which would release Israel, not only from temporary
 disease, but from death itself. 

<p>The third stage on the chart shows the NEW COVENANT being put
 into operation. When Christ appeared at the commencement of
 his ministry, John the Baptist pointed to him, exclaiming, 

<p>"Behold, the LAMB OF GOD, which taketh away the sin of the world."
 - (JOHN1: 29.) 

<p>Lambs had been used in the Old Covenant for many years as sacrifices
 to obtain healing and forgiveness. Now the Messiah, though perfect,
 would himself suffer death as the one sacrificial lamb for Israel
 and the whole world, that finally all might be forgiven and
 restored from death. Through breaking the Mosaic law, the nation
 of Israel died, and their Law showed them why they died as individuals.
 They were a people typified by a broken cross. Their only hope
 lay in the mercy of God bringing about a new creation. Then
 came the next stage in their spiritual education, the grace
 of the New Covenant, but Israel had to learn first the need
 of a Saviour before they would accept him and be in a position
 to teach the other nations to way of life. 

<p>The third flag of the Union Jack, the Cross of St. George, is
 the very shape of the cross of Calvary, showing that it does
 repre- sent the New Covenant of total forgiveness to Israel
 of all her transgressions. It is a red cross, signifying again
 a blood covenant. At the last supper, Christ passed around the
 cup of wine, saying, 

<p>"For this is my blood of the NEW TESTAMENT (COVENANT), which
 is shed for many for the remission of sins." - (MATTHEW 26:28)

<p>Christ thus intimated that his own blood would be shed as evidence
 that the price of death had been paid to redeem Israel and save
 the world ONCE AND FOR ALL. The way was then clear for God's
 servant to be cleansed and made perfect for ministry; and He
 extends the invitation to Israel to come back to Him

<p>"I have blotted out as a thick cloud thy transgressions, and
 as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for 1 have redeemed thee."
 - (ISAIAH 44: 22)

<p>"I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine
 own sake, and will not remember thy sins." - (ISAIAH 43: 25)

<p>When the cross of England is placed over the broken cross of
 Ireland to form the Union, the above scriptures are dramatically
 symbolised. The broken cross, which, we have seen, represents
 the broken Mosaic Covenant, IS BLOTTED OUT. In the Union Jack,
 the broken portion is still there, but covered up by the cross
 of England. This perfectly symbolises the fact that the cross
 of Calvary covers and blots out the transgressions of Israel.
 In spite of the fact that Israel disobeyed God, and broke His
 laws, resulting in dispersion, God has promised to "remember
 their sin no more."How well the completed Union Jack demonstrates
 that God has blotted out Israel's transgressions through the
 death of Christ. 

<p>Thus the British peoples, who own the Union Jack, are particularly
 the nations of the Covenants, or the "Covenant People," now
 rapidly nearing the consummation of their spiritual education
 and preparation as God's servant nation. Soon Israel will be
 fully UNITED WITH GOD as His sons to bless all nations. When
 Jacob of old prevailed with God at Peniel, the Lord changed
 his name to "ISRAEL" which means "a prince or son of God."

<p>"And he said unto him, What is thy name ? . . . Thy name shall
 be called no more Jacob, but ISRAEL , FOR AS A PRINCE HAST THOU
 POWER WITH GOD AND WITH MEN AND HAST PREVAILED." -(GENESIS 32:
 24-28)

<p>Parallel with the formation of the Union Jack, more and more
 of Jacob's descendants have become experimentally sons of God,
 truly God's ISRAEL. During the days of England under the Cross
 of St. George, there commenced the abandonment of idolatry,
 and the start of the Protestant Reformation. In the days of
 the Union between England and Scotland, there came the deeper
 spiritual awakening in the Wesleyan revivals. Then, under the
 completed Union Jack, there commenced the world-wide ministry
 of the Anglo-Saxon Missionary and Bible Societies. This was
 accompanied by a fuller Gospel including the truth of the second
 advent of Christ, while to-day the Gospel of the Kingdom is
 being crowned by the Anglo-Israel awakening, and the outpouring
 of the Spirit. 

<p>Parallel with this progressive return of Anglo-Saxon Israel to
 the God of their fathers, there has taken place the promised
 multiplication and expansion of the race over the earth to form
 the Ephraim-British Commonwealth of Nations, and the Manasseh-American
 Great Republic. From 1194 to 1606, the period of England under
 the single cross, the earth was almost unexplored. Toward the
 close of this period, the first attempts at colonisation were
 made in America. But most important of all, England defeated
 the Spanish Armada, which gave her dominion of the sea, the
 sure foundation of England's future greatness. In the next period,
 under the elementary Union Jack, 1606 to 1800, the British Empire
 was born by the conquest of India and Canada, and by the annexation
 of eastern Australia; while the United States emerged by the
 Declaration of Independence. Then the third and final period
 under the completed Union Jack, 1801 to 1941+ has witnessed
 the full development of the British Commonwealth of Nations
 and the great Republic of the United States of America. We now
 look forward to the coming re-union of Britain and America,
 and to the unification of the whole house of JACOB-ISRAEL UNITED
 WITH GOD, to bless all nations.
