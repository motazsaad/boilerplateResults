<h>Rights and Responsibilities of Test Takers: Guidelines and Expectations

<h>Preamble

<p>The intent of this statement is to enumerate and clarify the
 expectations that test takers may reasonably have about the
 testing process, and the expectations that those who develop,
 administer, and use tests may have of test takers.

<p>Tests are defined broadly here as psychological and educational
 instruments developed and used by testing professionals in organizations
 such as schools, industries, clinical practice, counseling settings
 and human service and other agencies, including those assessment
 procedures and devices that are used for making inferences about
 people in the above-named settings.

<p>The purpose of the statement is to inform and to help educate
 not only test takers, but also others involved in the testing
 enterprise so that measurements may be most validly and appropriately
 used. This document is intended as an effort to inspire improvements
 in the testing process and does not have the force of law. Its
 orientation is to encourage positive and high quality interactions
 between testing professionals and test takers.

<p>The rights and responsibilities listed in this document are neither
 legally based nor inalienable rights and responsibilities such
 as those listed in the United States of America's Bill of Rights.
 Rather, they represent the best judgments of testing professionals
 about the reasonable expectations that those involved in the
 testing enterprise (test producers, test users, and test takers)
 should have of each other.

<p>Testing professionals include developers of assessment products
 and services, those who market and sell them, persons who select
 them, test administrators and scorers, those who interpret test
 results, and trained users of the information. Persons who engage
 in each of these activities have significant responsibilities
 that are described elsewhere, in documents such as those that
 follow (American Association for Counseling and Development,
 1988; American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 1994; Joint
 Committee on Testing Practices, 1988; National Association of
 School Psychologists, 1992; National Council on Measurement
 in Education, 1995).

<p>In some circumstances, the test developer and the test user may
 not be the same person, group of persons, or organization. In
 such situations, the professionals involved in the testing should
 clarify, for the test taker as well as for themselves, who is
 responsible for each aspect of the testing process. For example,
 when an individual chooses to take a college admissions test,
 at least three parties are involved in addition to the test
 taker: the test developer and publisher, the individuals who
 administer the test to the test taker, and the institutions
 of higher education who will eventually use the information.
 In such cases a test taker may need to request clarifications
 about their rights and responsibilities. When test takers are
 young children (e.g., those taking standardized tests in the
 schools) or are persons who spend some or all their time in
 institutions or are incapacitated, parents or guardians may
 be granted some of the rights and responsibilities, rather than,
 or in addition to, the individual.

<p>Perhaps the most fundamental right test takers have is to be
 able to take tests that meet high professional standards, such
 as those described in Standards for Educational and Psychological
 Testing (American Educational Research Association, American
 Psychological Association, & National Council on Measurement
 in Education, 1999) as well as those of other appropriate professional
 associations. This statement should be used as an adjunct, or
 supplement, to those standards. State and federal laws, of course,
 supersede any rights and responsibilities that are stated here.

The Rights of Test Takers:
 Guidelines for Testing Professionals

<p>Test takers have the rights described below. It is the responsibility
 of the professionals involved in the testing process to ensure
 that test takers receive these rights.

<l>Because test takers have the right to be informed of their rights
 and responsibilities as test takers, it is normally the responsibility
 of the individual who administers a test (or the organization
 that prepared the test) to inform test takers of these rights
 and responsibilities.

<l>
Because test takers have the right to be treated with courtesy,
 respect, and impartiality, regardless of their age, disability,
 ethnicity, gender, national origin, race, religion, sexual orientation,
 or other personal characteristics, testing professionals should:

<l>Make test takers aware of any materials that are available to
 assist them in test preparation. These  materials should be
 clearly described in test registration and/or test familiarization
 materials.

<l>
See that test takers are provided with reasonable access to
 testing services.

<l>
Because test takers have the right to be tested with measures
 that meet professional standards that are appropriate for the
 test use and the test taker, given the manner in which the results
 will be used, testing professionals should:

<l>Take steps to utilize measures that meet professional standards
 and are reliable, relevant, useful given the intended purpose
 and are fair for test takers from varying societal groups.

<l>
Advise test takers that they are entitled to request reasonable
 accommodations in test administration that are likely to increase
 the validity of their test scores if they have a disability
 recognized under the Americans with Disabilities Act or other
 relevant legislation.

<l>
Because test takers have the right to be informed, prior to
 testing, about the test's purposes, the nature of the test,
 whether test results will be reported to the test takers, and
 the planned use of the results (when not in conflict with the
 testing purposes), testing professionals should:

<l>Give or provide test takers with access to a brief description
 about the test purpose (e.g., diagnosis, placement, selection,
 etc.) and the kind(s) of tests and formats that will be used
 (e.g., individual/group, multiple-choice/free response/performance,
 timed/untimed, etc.), unless such information might be detrimental
 to the objectives of the test.

<l>
Tell test takers, prior to testing, about the planned use(s)
 of the test results. Upon request, the test taker should be
 given information about how long such test scores are typically
 kept on file and remain available.

<l>
Provide test takers, if requested, with information about any
 preventative measures that have been instituted to safeguard
 the accuracy of test scores. Such information would include
 any quality control procedures that are employed and some of
 the steps taken to prevent dishonesty in test performance.

<l>
Inform test takers, in advance of the testing, about required
 materials that must be brought to the test site (e.g., pencil,
 paper) and about any rules that allow or prohibit use of other
 materials (e.g., calculators).

<l>
Provide test takers, upon request, with general information
 about the appropriateness of the test for its intended purpose,
 to the extent that such information does not involve the release
 of proprietary information. (For example, the test taker might
 be told, "Scores on this test are useful in predicting how successful
 people will be in this kind of work" or "Scores on this test,
 along with other information, help us to determine if students
 are likely to benefit from this program.")

<l>
Provide test takers, upon request, with information about re-testing,
 including if it is possible to re-take the test or another version
 of it, and if so, how often, how soon, and under what conditions.

<l>
Provide test takers, upon request, with information about how
 the test will be scored and in what detail. On multiple-choice
 tests, this information might include suggestions for test taking
 and about the use of a correction for guessing. On tests scored
 using professional judgment (e.g., essay tests or projective
 techniques), a general description of the scoring procedures
 might be provided except when such information is proprietary
 or would tend to influence test performance inappropriately.

<l>
Inform test takers about the type of feedback and interpretation
 that is routinely provided, as well as what is available for
 a fee. Test takers have the right to request and receive information
 regarding whether or not they can obtain copies of their test
 answer sheets or their test materials, if they can have their
 scores verified, and if they may cancel their test results.

<l>
Provide test takers, prior to testing, either in the written
 instructions, in other written documents or orally, with answers
 to questions that test takers may have about basic test administration
 procedures.

<l>
Inform test takers, prior to testing, if questions from test
 takers will not be permitted during the testing process.

<l>
Provide test takers with information about the use of computers,
 calculators, or other equipment, if any, used in the testing
 and give them an opportunity to practice using such equipment,
 unless its unpracticed use is part of the test purpose, or practice
 would compromise the validity of the results, and to provide
 a testing accommodation for the use of such equipment, if needed.

<l>
Inform test takers that, if they have a disability, they have
 the right to request and receive accommodations or modifications
 in accordance with the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities
 Act and other relevant legislation.

<l>
Provide test takers with information that will be of use in
 making decisions if test takers have options regarding which
 tests, test forms or test formats to take.

<l>
Because that test takers have a right to be informed in advance
 when the test will be administered, if and when test results
 will be available, and if there is a fee for testing services
 that the test takers are expected to pay, test professionals
 should: 

<l>Notify test takers of the alteration in a timely manner if a
 previously announced testing schedule changes, provide a reasonable
 explanation for the change, and inform test takers of the new
 schedule. If there is a change, reasonable alternatives to the
 original schedule should be provided.

<l>
Inform test takers prior to testing about any anticipated fee
 for the testing process, as well as the fees associated with
 each component of the process, if the components can be separated.

<l>
Because test takers have the right to have their tests administered
 and interpreted by appropriately trained individuals, testing
 professionals should:

<l>Know how to select the appropriate test for the intended purposes.

<l>
When testing persons with documented disabilities and other
 special characteristics that require special testing conditions
 and/or interpretation of results, have the skills and knowledge
 for such testing and interpretation.

<l>
Provide reasonable information regarding their qualifications,
 upon request.

<l>
Insure that test conditions, especially if unusual, do not unduly
 interfere with test performance. Test conditions will normally
 be similar to those used to standardize the test.

<l>
Provide candidates with a reasonable amount of time to complete
 the test, unless a test has a time limit.

<l>
Take reasonable actions to safeguard against fraudulent actions
 (e.g., cheating) that could place honest test takers at a disadvantage.

<l>
Because test takers have the right to be informed about why
 they are being asked to take particular tests, if a test is
 optional, and what the consequences are should they choose not
 to complete the test, testing professionals should: 

<l>Normally only engage in testing activities with test takers after
 the test takers have provided their informed consent to take
 a test, except when testing without consent has been mandated
 by law or governmental regulation, or when consent is implied
 by an action the test takers have already taken (e.g., such
 as when applying for employment and a personnel examination
 is mandated).

<l>
Explain to test takers why they should consider taking voluntary
 tests.

<l>
Explain, if a test taker refuses to take or complete a voluntary
 test, either orally or in writing, what the negative consequences
 may be to them for their decision to do so.

<l>
Promptly inform the test taker if a testing professional decides
 that there is a need to deviate from the testing services to
 which the test taker initially agreed (e.g., should the testing
 professional believe it would be wise to administer an additional
 test or an alternative test), and provide an explanation for
 the change.

<l>
Because test takers have a right to receive a written or oral
 explanation of their test results within a reasonable amount
 of time after testing and in commonly understood terms, testing
 professionals should: 

<l>Interpret test results in light of one or more additional considerations
 (e.g., disability, language proficiency), if those considerations
 are relevant to the purposes of the test and performance on
 the test, and are in accordance with current laws.

<l>
Provide, upon request, information to test takers about the
 sources used in interpreting their test results, including technical
 manuals, technical reports, norms, and a description of the
 comparison group, or additional information about the test taker(s).

<l>
Provide, upon request, recommendations to test takers about
 how they could improve their performance on the test, should
 they choose or be required to take the test again.

<l>
Provide, upon request, information to test takers about their
 options for obtaining a second interpretation of their results.
 Test takers may select an appropriately trained professional
 to provide this second opinion.

<l>
Provide test takers with the criteria used to determine a passing
 score, when individual test scores are reported and related
 to a pass-fail standard.

<l>
Inform test takers, upon request, how much their scores might
 change, should they elect to take the test again. Such information
 would include variation in test performance due to measurement
 error (e.g., the appropriate standard errors of measurement)
 and changes in performance over time with or without intervention
 (e.g., additional training or treatment).

<l>
Communicate test results to test takers in an appropriate and
 sensitive manner, without use of negative labels or comments
 likely to inflame or stigmatize the test taker.

<l>
Provide corrected test scores to test takers as rapidly as possible,
 should an error occur in the processing or reporting of scores.
 The length of time is often dictated by individuals responsible
 for processing or reporting the scores, rather than the individuals
 responsible for testing, should the two parties indeed differ.

<l>
Correct any errors as rapidly as possible if there are errors
 in the process of developing scores.

<l>
Because test takers have the right to have the results of tests
 kept confidential to the extent allowed by law, testing professionals
 should: 

<l>Insure that records of test results (in paper or electronic form)
 are safeguarded and maintained so that only individuals who
 have a legitimate right to access them will be able to do so.
 

<l>
Should provide test takers, upon request, with information regarding
 who has a legitimate right to access their test results (when
 individually identified) and in what form. Testing professionals
 should respond appropriately to questions regarding the reasons
 why such individuals may have access to test results and how
 they may use the results. 

<l>
Advise test takers that they are entitled to limit access to
 their results (when individually identified) to those persons
 or institutions, and for those purposes, revealed to them prior
 to testing. Exceptions may occur when test takers, or their
 guardians, consent to release the test results to others or
 when testing professionals are authorized by law to release
 test results. 

<l>
Keep confidential any requests for testing accommodations and
 the documentation supporting the request.

<l>
Because test takers have the right to present concerns about
 the testing process and to receive information about procedures
 that will be used to address such concerns, testing professionals
 should: 

<l>Inform test takers how they can question the results of the testing
 if they do not believe that the test was administered properly
 or scored correctly, or other such concerns. 

<l>
Inform test takers of the procedures for appealing decisions
 that they believe are based in whole or in part on erroneous
 test results. 
 Inform test takers, if their test results are
 under investigation and may be canceled, invalidated, or not
 released for normal use. In such an event, that investigation
 should be performed in a timely manner. The investigation should
 use all available information that addresses the reason(s) for
 the investigation, and the test taker should also be informed
 of the information that he/she may need to provide to assist
 with the investigation. 

<l>
Inform the test taker, if that test taker's test results are
 canceled or not released for normal use, why that action was
 taken. The test taker is entitled to request and receive information
 on the types of evidence and procedures that have been used
 to make that determination.

<h>The Responsibilities of Test Takers:
 Guidelines for Testing
 Professionals

<p>Testing Professionals should take steps to ensure that test takers
 know that they have specific responsibilities in addition to
 their rights described above.

<l>Testing professionals need to inform test takers that they should
 listen to and/or read their rights and responsibilities as a
 test taker and ask questions about issues they do not understand.

<l>
Testing professionals should take steps, as appropriate, to
 ensure that test takers know that they:

<l>Are responsible for their behavior throughout the entire testing
 process.
 Should not interfere with the rights of others involved
 in the testing process. 

<l>
Should not compromise the integrity of the test and its interpretation
 in any manner.

<l>
Testing professionals should remind test takers that it is their
 responsibility to ask questions prior to testing if they are
 uncertain about why the test is being given, how it will be
 given, what they will be asked to do, and what will be done
 with the results. Testing professionals should: 

<l>Advise test takers that it is their responsibility to review
 materials supplied by test publishers and others as part of
 the testing process and to ask questions about areas that they
 feel they should understand better prior to the start of testing.

<l>
Inform test takers that it is their responsibility to request
 more information if they are not satisfied with what they know
 about how their test results will be used and what will be done
 with them.

<l>
Testing professionals should inform test takers that it is their
 responsibility to read descriptive material they receive in
 advance of a test and to listen carefully to test instructions.
 Testing professionals should inform test takers that it is their
 responsibility to inform an examiner in advance of testing if
 they wish to receive a testing accommodation or if they have
 a physical condition or illness that may interfere with their
 performance. Testing professionals should inform test takers
 that it is their responsibility to inform an examiner if they
 have difficulty comprehending the language in which the test
 is given. Testing professionals should: 

<l>Inform test takers that, if they need special testing arrangements,
 it is their responsibility to request appropriate accommodations
 and to provide any requested documentation as far in advance
 of the testing date as possible. Testing professionals should
 inform test takers about the documentation needed to receive
 a requested testing accommodation.

<l>
Inform test takers that, if they request but do not receive
 a testing accommodation, they could request information about
 why their request was denied.

<l>
Testing professionals should inform test takers when and where
 the test will be given, and whether payment for the testing
 is required. Having been so informed, it is the responsibility
 of the test taker to appear on time with any required materials,
 pay for testing services and be ready to be tested. Testing
 professionals should:  

<l>Inform test takers that they are responsible for familiarizing
 themselves with the appropriate materials needed for testing
 and for requesting information about these materials, if needed.
 

<l>
Inform the test taker, if the testing situation requires that
 test takers bring materials (e.g., personal identification,
 pencils, calculators, etc.) to the testing site, of this responsibility
 to do so.

<l>
Testing professionals should advise test takers, prior to testing,
 that it is their responsibility to:

<l>Listen to and/or read the directions given to them. 

<l>Follow instructions given by testing professionals. 
 Complete
 the test as directed. 

<l>
Perform to the best of their ability if they want their score
 to be a reflection of their best effort. 

<l>
Behave honestly (e.g., not cheating or assisting others who
 cheat).

<l>
Testing professionals should inform test takers about the consequences
 of not taking a test, should they choose not to take the test.
 Once so informed, it is the responsibility of the test taker
 to accept such consequences, and the testing professional should
 so inform the test takers. If test takers have questions regarding
 these consequences, it is their responsibility to ask questions
 of the testing professional, and the testing professional should
 so inform the test takers.

<l>
Testing professionals should inform test takers that it is their
 responsibility to notify appropriate persons, as specified by
 the testing organization, if they do not understand their results,
 or if they believe that testing conditions affected the results.
 Testing professionals should: 

<l>Provide information to test takers, upon request, about appropriate
 procedures for questioning or canceling their test scores or
 results, if relevant to the purposes of testing. 

<l>Provide to test takers, upon request, the procedures for reviewing,
 re-testing, or canceling their scores or test results, if they
 believe that testing conditions affected their results and if
 relevant to the purposes of testing. 

<l>
Provide documentation to the test taker about known testing
 conditions that might have affected the results of the testing,
 if relevant to the purposes of testing.

<l>
Testing professionals should advise test takers that it is their
 responsibility to ask questions about the confidentiality of
 their test results, if this aspect concerns them.

<l>
Testing professionals should advise test takers that it is their
 responsibility to present concerns about the testing process
 in a timely, respectful manner.
