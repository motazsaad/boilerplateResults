<l>Conveying information in a story provides a rich context, remaining
 in the conscious memory longer and creating more memory traces
 than information not in context. Therefore a story is more likely
 to be acted upon than normal means of communications. Storytelling,
 whether in a personal or organizational setting, connects people,
 develops creativity, and increases confidence. The use of stories
 in organizations can build descriptive capabilities, increase
 organizational learning, convey complex meaning, and communicate
 common values and rule sets. 

<l>Description capabilities are essential in strategic thinking
 and planning, and create a greater awareness of what we could
 achieve. Fictional stories can be powerful because they provide
 a mechanism by which an organization can learn from failure
 without attributing blame. 

<l>With the advent of the Internet and Intranet, there is a larger
 opportunity to use stories to bring about change. Electronic
 media adds moving images and sound as context setters. Hypertext
 capabilities and collaboration software invites groups, teams
 and communities to co-create their stories. New multiprocessing
 skills are required to navigate this new world, skills that
 include the quick and sure assimilation of and response to fast-flowing
 images and sounds and sensory assaults. 

<l>In summary, when used well storytelling is a powerful transformational
 tool in organizations, one that all of our managers and leaders
 across the Department need to utilize. 

<l>NASA's ASK Talks with Dr. Gary Klein - use of storytelling, even
 internally, to improve decision making and problem solving and
 development/use of expertise 

<l>According to the theory, the story coordinates three types of
 knowledge: 

<l>facts or information from the current situation 

<l>knowledge about similar situations 

<l>generic expectations about what makes a complete story, such
 as believing that people do what they do for a reason 

<l>Given a set of known facts in an unfolding situation, knowledge
 about similar situations, and expectations about what is needed
 to make a complete story, the decisionmaker can know when important
 information is missing, and where inferences must be made. 

<l>Construct a story 

<l>Evaluate story for coverage - concerns the extent to which the
 story accounts for evidence 

<l>Evaluate story for coherence 

<l>consistency - concerns the extent to which the story does not
 contain contradictions 

<l>plausibility - concerns the extent to which the story is consistent
 with real or imagined events in the real world 

<l>completeness - concerns the extent to which a story has all of
 its parts 

<l>In this conversation with HBR, Robert McKee, the world's best-known
 screenwriting lecturer, argues that executives can engage people
 in a much deeper--and ultimately more convincing--way if they
 toss out their Power-Point slides and memos and learn to tell
 good stories. As human beings, we make sense of our experiences
 through stories. But becoming a good storyteller is hard. It
 requires imagination and an understanding of what makes a story
 worth telling. All great stories deal with the conflict between
 subjective expectations and an uncooperative objective reality.
 

<l>"A man who listens because he has nothing to say can hardly be
 a source of inspiration. The only listening that counts is that
 of the talker who alternatively absorbs and expresses ideas."

<l>Ten Commandments of Good Listening - as posted by the Wildland
 Fire Leadership Development Program 

<l>the first ten - from K. Davis, Human Behavior at Work, McGraw
 Hill, 1972 

<l>Stop talking. Obvious, but not easy. 

<l>Put the speaker at ease. Create a permissive, supportive climate
 in which the speaker will feel free to express himself or herself.
 

<l>Show a desire to listen. Act interested and mean it. 

<l>Remove distractions. External preoccupation is less likely if
 nothing external is present to preoccupy you. 

<l>Empathize. Try to experience to some degree the feelings the
 speaker is experiencing. 

<l>Be patient. Give the speaker time to finish; don't interrupt.
 

<l>Hold your temper. Don't let your emotions obstruct your thoughts.
 

<l>Go easy on argument and criticism. Suspend judgment. 

<l>Ask questions. If things are still unclear when a speaker has
 finished, ask questions which serve to clarify the intended
 meanings. 

<l>Stop talking. In case you missed the first commandment. 

<l>additional listening techniques - from P. Bradley and J. Baird,
 Communication for Business and the Professions, Brown, 1980
 

<l>Preparation. If you know what the topic is ahead of time, learn
 something about it so you will not be an ignorant listener.
 Even some careful thinking will allow you to listen more accurately
 when the communication actually begins. 

<l>Seek intent. Try to discover the intent of the source; why is
 he or she saying these things? 

<l>Seek structure. Look for an organizational scheme of the message.
 If the speaker is an accomplished one, you won't have to look
 very hard; it will be obvious. But if the speaker is less skilled,
 the responsibility falls to you. 

<l>Analyze. Do not accept what you hear at face value; analyze what
 the speaker is saying and pay attention to body language. 

<l>Focus. Keep the main topic of the message in mind at all times,
 using it to bring focus to the information which the speaker
 supplies. 

<l>Motivate yourself. This may be the most important. Listening
 takes work, and to do that you may have to "psych yourself up."
 

<l>The traditional interviewer asks many questions, each of which
 elicits a very brief response. The cognitive interview, on the
 other hand, is in some ways a questionless interview. The goal
 is to ask as few questions as possible so that witnesses give
 you long narrative responses that each contains that much more
 information than a traditional interview. The objective is to
 try to elicit information, not extract information. The good
 interviewer tries to create a social environment so the witness
 generates information without having to wait for questions to
 be asked. 

<l>The developers of this method found that how investigators interview
 individuals can significantly impact the ability of the witnesses
 to remember and report the details of an event. Their research
 indicated the cognitive interview as the most effective technique
 for facilitating memory retrieval with cooperative witnesses.
 Using proper interview techniques is particularly important
 for high-stress situations because during experiential thinking,
 the individual is more likely to be dissociative and “encodes
 reality in concrete images, metaphors, and narratives,” whereas,
 in rational thinking, the individual is more logical and “encodes
 reality in abstract symbols, words, and numbers.” 

<l>As cognitive interviewing involves thinking aloud on the part
 of the interviewee, one should keep in mind the following item
 (which may also apply to cultures other than Asian) from 

<l>To test the possibility that Asians and Asian Americans in fact
 find it relatively difficult to use language to represent thought,
 Kim had people speak out loud as they solved various kinds of
 problems. This had no effect on the performance of European
 Americans. But the requirement to speak out loud had very deleterious
 effects on the performance of Asians and Asian Americans.

<l>FM 34-52 Intelligence Interrogation, 1992 version NOTE: some
 sources believe the 1987 version below was more permissive than
 the 1992 version above - however, even in the 1987 version below
 you can see the prohibition against force. 

<l>Principles of Interrogation, in Chapter 1, FM 34-52 (1987 version,
 now superceded) - included the following 

<p> Interrogation is the art of questioning and examining a source
 to obtain the maximum amount of usable information. The goal
 of any interrogation is to obtain usable and reliable information,
 in a lawful manner and in the least amount of time, which meets
 intelligence requirements of any echelon of command. 

<p>...

<p>The use of force, mental torture, threats, insults, or exposure
 to unpleasant and inhumane treatment of any kind is prohibited
 by law and is neither authorized nor condoned by the US Government.
 Experience indicates that the use of force is not necessary
 to gain the cooperation of sources for interrogation. Therefore,
 the use of force is a poor technique, as it yields unreliable
 results, may damage subsequent collection efforts, and can induce
 the source to say whatever he thinks the interrogator wants
 to hear. However, the use of force is not to be confused with
 psychological ploys, verbal trickery, or other nonviolent and
 noncoercive ruses used by the interrogator in questioning hesitant
 or uncooperative sources. 

<p> The psychological techniques and principles outlined should
 neither be confused with, nor construed to be synonymous with,
 unauthorized techniques such as brainwashing, mental torture,
 or any other form of mental coercion to include drugs. These
 techniques and principles are intended to serve as guides in
 obtaining the willing cooperation of a source. The absence of
 threats in interrogation is intentional, as their enforcement
 and use normally constitute violations of international law
 and may result in prosecution under the UCMJ. 

<p> Additionally, the inability to carry out a threat of violence
 or force renders an interrogator ineffective should the source
 challenge the threat. Consequently, from both legal and moral
 viewpoints, the restrictions established by international law,
 agreements, and customs render threats of force, violence, and
 deprivation useless as interrogation techniques.

<l>Discover Magazine [Jan 2005 issue] reports Ekman is working with
 the Department of Defense on software that could detect liars
 by studying facial emotions, called micro-expressions, that
 go unnoticed by the untrained eye. 

<p> "They look just like an ordinary expression, except they're
 only on the face about a 25th of a second," this researcher
 observes. Ekman has shown that certain emotions flash almost
 undetectably when people are telling high-stakes lies, where
 they benefit or lose a lot.

<l>Defense Information School Broadcast Writing Style Guide (local
 copy) - audience is DINFOS students as well as "all Department
 of Defense members who write and prepare broadcast news releases,
 features, spots, and public service announcements for military
 and civilian media" 

<p> In studies of the belief bias effect in syllogistic reasoning,
 an interaction between logical validity and the believability
 of the conclusion has been found; in essence, logic has a larger
 effect on unbelievable than on believable conclusions. Two main
 explanations have been proposed for this finding. The selective
 scrutiny account claims that people focus on the conclusion
 and only engage in logical processing if this is found to be
 unbelievable; while the misinterpreted necessity account claims
 that subjects misunderstand what is meant by logical necessity
 and respond on the basis of believability when indeterminate
 syllogisms are presented. ... [five experiments were run] ...
 It is concluded that people try to construct a mental model
 of the premises but, if there is a believable conclusion consistent
 with the first model they produce, then they fail to construct
 alternative models. 

<l>Meet your listeners at their level of understanding. Use metaphors:
 Compare unfamiliar facts with something simple the audience
 already knows. An example would be comparing the flow of water
 in a pipe with the flow of electricity in a wire. People learn
 more rapidly when the information relates to their own experience.
 

<l>Metaphors and Paradigms of Team Cognition: a Twenty Year Perspective,
 by McNeese, Penn. State Univ., in Proceedings of the Human Factors
 and Ergonomics Society 47th Annual Meeting, 2003, posted by
 Office of Naval Research 

<l>Uses metaphors to describe organizational relations. Includes
 quote below. 

<l>"Metaphor is often regarded just as a device for embellishing
 discourse, but its significance is much greater than this. The
 use of metaphor implies a way of thinking and a way of seeing
 that pervade how we understand our world generally. . . . Metaphor
 is inherently paradoxical. It can create powerful insights that
 also become distortions, as the way of seeing created through
 a metaphor becomes a way of not seeing." - from Gareth Morgan,
 Images of Organization, 2d ed. (Thousand Oaks, Calif.: Sage
 Publications, 1997), 4-5. 

<l>Just as there are plentiful examples where critical scientific
 breakthroughs have occurred while the right brain (our intuitive,
 pre-verbal cognitive resource) was operating ahead of the pack,
 strategic vision requires an ability to think in metaphors,
 to seek related patterns in unrelated objects, situations, and
 events. True, our future senior leaders will have access to
 more information. The successful ones will be those who are
 best able to sort out the important from the interesting. The
 development and testing of analogies--the patterns that allow
 leaders to see the important under data overload, is a skill
 that could waste away under a sterile diet of expert systems
 and virtual reality simulations.
