<p>Ordered nachos as starters which they forgot to bring until the
 main course. Fajitas were only average. I was expecting them
 to arrive sizzling hot but they weren't so the food was only
 lukewarm.

<p>What did you drink?

<p>Bottle of house white at about £13 was okay.

<p>What's the crowd like?

<p>Arrived about 7pm on a Monday night so had a choice of tables.
 Got quite full later on.

<p>And the vibe? 

<p>Nice building but tables were a bit cramped and the chairs uncomfortable.
 The couple at the next table started smoking so it was time
 to skip dessert and coffee and leave.

<p>Anything else you'd like to say?

<p>Overall disappointing. Seem to be trading on reputation alone.
 There are plenty of better options in York.

<p>Value for money?

<p>£53 for 3 mains and wine. They didn't charge for the starters.

<p>Restaurant

<p>If I was being generous I'd say it was fair. However, if I was
 more honest, I'd say overrated. But my problem wasn't with the
 food.

<p>What did you drink?

<p>Bottled beer and house wine. Slightly pricey, but tasted nice.

<p>What's the crowd like?

<p>Was told you can’t book, so turned up without a reservation and
 had to wait two hours for a table. When we were finally seated,
 we noticed many tables were unused. Upstairs the bar was packed
 full of people waiting for tables and downstairs there were
 LOTS of tables unused? I got the feeling they were just ushering
 customers upstairs for an hour or two to get a few extra rounds
 of drinks out of them. Very annoying! Not in a rush to return!

<p>Value for money?

<p>I paid £8 for a plate of nachos chips with a couple of dollops
 of salsa for a starter.

<p>Plunketts

<p>Plunketts is part of a Christmas tradition with us. We first
 visited years ago and have returned regularly (always at Christmas
 time) on our (at least) biennial shopping visit to York. The
 food is always excellent and the steaks are cooked just how
 you order them. I can also speak very highly of the 'bowl'o'red'!
 This time round we tried the Christmas cake and Godminster for
 dessert, and for a strictly Cheddar-only man like me this was
 a real treat - Fantastic! However having since purchased some
 of the aforementioned cheese I have been disappointed not to
 be able to achieve the same kick. 

<p>What did you drink?

<p>Black Sheep. Its as much a part of the tradition as admiring
 the view through the bedsit window across the street from upstairs,
 or banging my head on the low beams. 

<p>What's the crowd like?

<p>Sadly the clientele appear to be getting younger; I say 'appear'
 because I am a realist and suspect that age wise I now have
 more in common with the fabric of the building than some of
 the punters!

<p>And the vibe? 

<p>Soapbox time! Apart from it's everpresent inbuilt charm and ambience,
 on this occassion I was put off (upstairs at least) by the fug
 of smoke. The truth is I don't often get out these days and
 to have an evening as special as this marred (not exactly spoiled)
 by something as blatantly antisocial (its only social to those
 who enjoy it) was a tad upsetting. No doubting where I stand
 on the great debate then!

<p>Anything else you'd like to say?

<p>If you should visit in the week before Christmas be sure to have
 a seat next to the roaring fire! Only my wife likes to sit next
 to the window in the bar to see the Minster - so do I, of course!
 

<p>Value for money?

<p>Always! We shared the dessert and still couldn't manage it! 

<p>Amazing! The fajitas were fantasic and the portion was more than
 enough for one person.

<p>What did you drink?

<p>the house white is cheap and fruity

<p>What's the crowd like?

<p>chilled out atmosphere and the pictures of all the famous people
 really amazing.

<p>Anything else you'd like to say?

<p>Overall it was great, i will reccomend it to all my friends and
 will certainly go again!

<p>Value for money?

<p>It is about £4.50 for a starter and £10.00 ish for a main, well
 worth it though!

<p>Plunkets 

<p>Snouts

<p>Fanastic. Wide choice and variety. Took a long time to decide
 what to order! 

<p>What did you drink?

<p>House white, very nice.

<p>What's the crowd like?

<p>Trendy, I could go with a partner or friends. I think it has
 the right setting to make the atmosphere what you want. Lots
 of pictures of famous stars everywhere, great.

<p>Anything else you'd like to say?

<p>Will definately be going again. Staff were friendly and the food
 exceptional.

<p>Value for money?

<p>For 7; 3 courses and drinks it came to £180 which was good value
 for money. Each course was a generous portion only just had
 enough room for desert.

<p>We're sorry to announce that the Greedy Pig has eaten one wafer
 thin mint too many and looks unlikely to recover so this section
 of the BBC North Yorkshire website is now closed. Many thanks
 to everyone who submitted reviews.

<p>Existing reviews will remain on this site for a while as an archive,
 but won't be updated.
