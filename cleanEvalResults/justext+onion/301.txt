<p>The Bumper Dumper® is not just an accessory, it's a necessity.Whether
 you are a hunter, fisherman, camper, or off- roader, the Bumper
 Dumper is a great item for all outdoor enthusiasts. It's great
 to have on construction sites, traveling with kids,or at the
 beach. Anywhere you may need to go while on the go the Bumper
 Dumper® is a must have item. Just a trailer hitch receiver on
 the back of your vehicle with a Bumper Dumper®, and no more
 squatting in a bush, no more unstable, flimsy, rickety,under
 sized porta potty,and no more smelly unsanitary outhouses. Just
 plug the Bumper Dumper® into your hitch receiver and the comfort
 of home is there when nature calls.

<p>Have you ever been stuck in the middle of nowhere with no place
 to go?Has this happened to you? You're at the campsite or in
 the middle of nowhere and suddenly nature calls. What do you
 do? You squeamishly go looking for a quiet spot behind a bush
 to do your thing. You cautiously avoid the poison oak and ivy.
 As you carefully squat down and try to relax a snake suddenly
 comes slithering through the weeds and startles you. What a
 mess!
 Now when nature calls you can go in comfort where ever
 you are with the one and only Bumper Dumper®. No more looking
 for the right spot, no more trying to balance while squatting,
 and no more surprises from creepy critters. Just park your vehicle
 in a nice secluded spot, plug the Bumper Dumper® in to your
 trailer hitch receiver, and VOILA!! A portable toilet sturdy
 enough to hold 500 lbs. and just as comfortable as using the
 bathroom at home. You can even set up a privacy screen for complete
 comfort.

<p> 

<p>Has this happened to you?You're driving on a long secluded stretch
 of road. You and the family had a big dinner at the last restaurant
 about an hour ago and someone's gotta go. "Can you hold it till
 the next stop", you ask. You drive a few miles and the sign
 says next station 90 miles ahead. Meanwhile, she tells you she
 needs to go too, but she can wait till the next stop. You keep
 driving a while and find yourself starting to feel the urge
 as well. By this time everyone is getting pretty anxious. You
 finally see the exit to the station and the brain kicks in.
 Everyone knows it's almost time for relief. You quickly exit
 and pull in to park. You get the restroom key from the attendant
 and hurry to open the door. 

<p>You open the door and see this!!!!

<p>Not Anymore!It's Super Sanitary

<p>At one time or another you'll wish you had a Bumper Dumper®.

 It's great on those long road trips. The Bumper Dumper® is light
 weight and stores easily. Now you have a safe and sanitary alternative
 to those road side nightmares. You can be assured of a sanitary
 place to go wherever you go. Take it hunting, fishing, camping,
 boating, vacation, on the job, in the field, or anywhere you
 may need to go. 

<p>The Bumper Dumper® is great to have anywhere you go. No other
 portable toilet can compare to the support, stability and comfort
 that the Bumper Dumper® offers. The frame is made from quality
 steel and comes with a standard size toilet seat. It's the only
 portable toilet you can use your own seat on. Almost any standard
 size toilet seat can be mounted to the frame so you can attach
 a padded seat or the favorite seat of your choice. The Bumper
 Dumper® will last a long long time and it's light weight and
 so easy to use. If you have a trailer hitch receiver and travel
 or engage in outdoor activities where restrooms are far and
 few in between the Bumper Dumper® is a must have item.
 Makes
 a great gift too. 

<p>When traveling just pull off to a secluded spot and plug the
 Bumper Dumper® into the hitch receiver. No more having to wait
 for the next unsanitary rest area.
