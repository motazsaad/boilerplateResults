<p>Canada Post’s computerized systems can decipher a wide range
 of addressing styles &#150; from handwritten notation to typed
 and printed labels, but studies show that a consistent approach
 to mail addressing leads to more efficient handling. For Canada
 Post’s Customers, large and small, this translates into better
 service and lower costs. Consistent and accurate addressing
 eliminates the need for extra handling or redelivery by Canada
 Post. Standardized addressing ensures that mail is consistently
 “delivered on time, the first time, every time.”

<p>The guidelines in this chapter promote the most technologically
 efficient formats for addressing. It does not limit mailers
 to any one format. In some cases, because of individual preference
 or other considerations, mailers may not be able to follow the
 formats that this Guide presents.

<p>For more technical information on the physical characteristics
 necessary for effective processing by Canada Post’s automated
 systems, Go to Canadian Postal Standards.

<l>Addresses should be written in upper case; however, mailers may
 wish to use lower case due to individual preference or other
 considerations.

<l>Postal codes should be printed in upper case with the first three
 elements separated from the last three by one space (no hyphens).
 If the postal code is not formatted in this manner, the mail
 may be delayed.

<l>The municipality, province or territory, and postal code should
 always appear on the same line. There should be one space between
 the municipality, province or territory and two spaces between
 the province or territory and postal code.

<l>Characters in the address block should not be underlined.

<l>Punctuation should not be used unless it is part of a proper
 name, (ST. JOHN'S). However, mailers may wish to use punctuation
 due to individual preference or other considerations.

<l>Accents may be used as they are an integral part of language
 but they are not considered to be punctuation.

<l>The # symbol should never be used, nor the French equivalent
 no as part of the address.

<l>All lines of an address should be formatted with a uniform left
 margin and should be less than 40 characters per line, excluding
 spaces.

<l>Space between address lines should be at least 0.5 mm but no
 more than one blank line between lines of addressing.

<l>All characters should be larger than 2 mm and smaller than 5
 mm from the top to bottom (10 to 12-point). Return addresses
 may use smaller characters and should not be larger than the
 destination address.

<l>Only non-proportional fonts (characters which occupy the same
 width) should be used. The following are examples of acceptable
 fonts: OCR B, Letter Gothic, Elite, Lotus Line-Draw, MS Line
 Draw, Courier, Courier New, Pica and Copy Pica.

<l>Return addresses should be formatted in the same fashion as the
 destination address, and located in the top-left corner of the
 mail piece, clearly separated from the destination address,
 or on the back of the mail piece at the top. The return address
 is mandatory on Priority Courier, Xpresspost, Expedited Parcel
 and Regular Parcel items.

<p>Illustrations

<p>The following examples illustrate Canada Post's recommended addressing
 guidelines.

<l>Additional delivery information is optional data that a mailer
 wishes to include. (title, floor, etc.) It is always placed
 above the civic address.

<l>A unit number is placed before the civic number with a hyphen
 between, OR after the street type, using an acceptable unit
 identifier (ex. APT 10). Please see Unit Designators for a list.
 The unit information may be placed on the line above the street
 information if space is an issue.

<l>The civic number is the official number assigned to an address
 by the municipality.

<l>When a civic number suffix is present, there is no space when
 it is alpha (123A), and there is one space when it is a fraction
 (123 1/2).

<l>The street name is the official name recognized by each municipality
 and should not be translated. (Ex.: Main is not Principale.)
 There is no space between a numerical street name with an ordinal
 or an alphanumeric character. (Ex.: 2ND ST or 36A ST). When
 the street name is numeric, there is only one space (no hyphen)
 between the civic number and the street name. (Ex.: 123 22ND
 AVE).

<l>The street type is provided by the municipality. Common abbreviations
 should be used. Please see Street Types below for a complete
 list. In some instances, the street type is also the street
 name (THE PARKWAY). The only street types that may be translated
 are:

<p>ST

<p>=

<p>RUE

<p>A French street type is placed before the street name, unless
 it is an ordinal number (1re, 2e, PREMIÈRE, DEUXIÈME, etc.)

<l>The street direction uses the common one- or two-letter abbreviation.
 Please see Street Directions for a complete list.

<l>The official municipality name, as provided to Canada Post, the
 official abbreviation of the municipality, or an official alternate
 name, should be used and should not be translated. (Ex.: TROIS-RIVI&Egrave;RES
 is not THREE RIVERS.)

<l>The province should always be presented using the recognized
 two-letter symbol. Please see Province and Territory Symbols
 below for a complete listing. Mailers may wish to have the province
 written in full and placed in brackets. Ex.: (Qu&eacute;bec)

<l>The postal code should be in upper case and placed two spaces
 to the right of the province with one space between the first
 three and last three characters.

<l>Additional delivery information is optional data that a mailer
 wishes to include. (title, floor, municipal address, etc.) It
 is always placed above the post office box address.

<l>The post office box number should always be placed on the line
 just above the municipality, province and postal code. The #
 symbol should not be used, nor the French equivalent n o. Punctuation
 should not be used.

<l>Station information should be present to direct mail to the proper
 postal installation when there is more than one installation
 within a municipality.

<p>Station 

<p>=

<p>STN

<p>RPO

<l>The official municipality name, as provided to Canada Post, the
 official abbreviation of the municipality, or an official alternate
 name, must should be used and cannot should not be translated.
 (Ex.: TROIS-RIVIÈRES is not THREE RIVERS.)

<l>The province should always be presented using the recognized
 two-letter symbol. Please see Province and Territory Symbols
 below for a complete listing. Mailers may wish to have the province
 written in full and placed in brackets. Ex.: (Québec)

<l>The postal code should be in upper case and placed two spaces
 to the right of the province with one space between the first
 three and last three characters.

<l>Many rural areas now have civic addresses. Civic addresses may
 be added above the rural route. In some locations, the rural
 route (RR) designator is no longer required.

<l>Additional address information is often required for delivery
 to this type of address. Some examples include: SITE/ COMPARTMENT,
 LOT/CONCESSION, civic address, attention line, title, floor.
 The word BOX should not be used in place of COMPARTMENT.

<l>The rural route identifier should use the two-letter symbol (RR,
 SS, MR), followed by the number, one space to the right. The
 # symbol should not be used, nor the French equivalent, n o.
 Punctuation should not be used in RR, SS, or MR.

<l>Station information should be present to direct mail to the proper
 postal installation when there is more than one installation
 within a municipality.

<p>Military addressing is defined as mail sent to or by the Department
 of National Defense, Canadian Forces personnel, their dependents
 and civilians attached to Canadian Forces served through Canadian
 Forces Post Offices and Fleet Mail Offices. Go to Section E
 &#150; Chapter 12, Canadian Forces Mail.

<p>Addressing elements required by the United States Postal Service
 should be prepared according to the United States postal standards.

<l>All U.S.A. mail items must be addressed to a specific individual,
 organization or company name.

<l>The full municipality name should be used and should appear as
 the first component in the second last line of the address block.

<l>The two-letter state symbol is preferred over the full state
 name. The state symbol should appear on the second last line
 of the address following the municipality, separated by one
 space. Please see United States of America &#150; States, Territories
 and Possessions below for a complete listing.

<l>The ZIP code must be separated from the state symbol by two spaces.
 It may be either five or nine digits. If the nine-digit format
 is used, a hyphen will be used to separate the fifth and sixth
 digits.

<l>The country name should appear alone on the last line of the
 address block.

<p>All international mail items must be addressed to a specific
 individual, organization or company name. Also, to ensure proper
 processing, the country name should be spelled correctly and
 in full. (Ex.: UAE is not acceptable for UNITED ARAB EMIRATES.
 Go to Section&#160;H, International Destination Listing, for
 a complete listing and correct spelling of countries.

<p>The name of the country should be the last entry on the address.
 It is placed at the bottom, below the municipality/city name
 and any postal code/zip code information.)

<p>Canada Post encourages all mailers to respect the wishes of Customers
 in matters of format. These guidelines have taken care to accommodate
 the requirements of the English and French languages by recognizing
 and accepting the use of upper- and lower- case characters,
 including accents, as well as the full spelling of and punctuation
 between addressing elements.

<p>The following are the most technologically efficient unit designators.
 In some cases, because of individual preference or other considerations,
 a mailer may use other unit designators.

<p>The postal code is an integral part of every postal address in
 Canada. The postal code was designed to aid in sorting mail
 by both mechanized and manual methods. It also enables the Customer
 to presort mail, thereby bypassing a number of sorting processes
 within Canada Post and reducing costs.

<p>The Structure of the Postal Code

<p>The postal code is a six-character uniformly structured, alphanumeric
 code in the form “ANA NAN” where “A” represents an alphabetic
 character and “N” represents a numeric character. A postal code
 is made up of two segments: “forward sortation area” and “local
 delivery unit.”

<p>The forward sortation area is a combination of three characters
 (alpha-numeric-alpha). It identifies a major geographic area
 in an urban or a rural location.

<p>The local delivery unit is a combination of three characters
 (numeric-alpha-numeric). It identifies the smallest delivery
 unit within a forward sortation area.

<p>Forward Sortation Area &#150; The First Segment of the Postal
 Code

<p>The “forward sortation area” or “FSA” represents a specific area
 within a major geographic region or province. The forward sortation
 area provides the basis for the primary sorting of forward mail.
 

<p>The first character of the forward sortation area segment identifies
 one of the 18 major geographic areas, provinces or districts:

<p>The second character of the forward sortation area is an important
 component of mail preparation as it identifies either: 

<l>an urban postal code: numerals 1 to 9 (E2J). Urban postal codes
 are generally serviced by Letter Carrier or community mailboxes;
 or

<l>a rural postal code: numeral 0 (zero) (A0A). Rural postal codes
 are serviced by rural route drivers and/or postal outlets.

<p>The third character of the forward sortation area segment (E2J)
 in conjunction with the first two characters, describes an exact
 area of a city or town or other geographic area.

<p>Local Delivery Unit &#150; The Second Segment of the Postal Code

<p>The “local delivery unit” or “LDU”, identified by the last three
 characters of the postal code, allows for a more final sort
 within a forward sortation area.

<p>In urban areas, the last three characters may indicate a specific
 city block (one side of a street between two intersecting streets),
 a single building or, in some cases, a large-volume mail receiver.

<p>In rural areas, the last three characters, together with the
 forward sortation area, identify a specific rural community.

<p>Postal Code Address Data

<p>Canada Post’s postal code address data is used to determine or
 verify the correct postal code for an address anywhere in Canada
 or identify the complete range of addresses that correspond
 to any one postal code. The data is available by download from
 a secured Canada Post FTP site, on CD-ROM or IBM cartridge,
 and is updated and distributed monthly.

<p>Delivery Mode data, Householder and Householder-Plus data are
 also available. Additional information on postal code data is
 available at : www.canadapost.ca/offerings/address_management/can/other_data-e.asp.

<p>Canadian Postal Code Searching Tools

<p>The Canadian Postal Code Directory&#169; contains postal code
 information for all addresses in Canada. It facilitates postal
 code lookup and verification.

<p>The Canadian Postal Code Directory can be purchased in hard copy
 through the National Philatelic Centre at 1-800-565-4362, or
 at selected postal outlets.

<p>Free postal code lookup is available to Customers through Canada
 Post’s website at: « www.canadapost.ca/tools/pcl/bin/advanced-e.asp
 ».

<p>Postal codes can also be obtained by calling 1-900-565-2633 for
 service in English or 1-900-565-2634 for service in French.

<p>Address Accuracy is a program designed to improve delivery by
 encouraging Customers to accurately address mail. Every item
 must be addressed to a specific individual or company. In the
 case of Addressed Admail and Catalogue Mail, items may also
 be addressed to a non-personalized descriptor, such as "Occupant"
 or similar wording. Every item must display a complete mailing
 address including any required suite or unit information as
 well as the valid postal code for that address. If the mailing
 address is not complete, the mail may be delayed or returned.

<p>Consistent and accurate addressing eliminates the need for extra
 handling and/or redelivery. For Customers, this translates into
 a more efficient service and lower costs. Accurate addressing
 helps ensure the mail is delivered on time, every time.

<p>Participation in the Address Accuracy Program is mandatory for
 all Machineable, Letter Carrier Presort (LCP), and NDG Presort
 mailings greater than 5,000 items. 

<p>The standard for Address Accuracy is 95%. This means that 95%
 of the addresses on the Customer's database are determined to
 be valid. This is done by using a Canada Post recognized address
 validation and/or address validation and correction software.
 If the percentage on the Statement of Accuracy (SOA) produced
 by the software is less than 95%, an adjustment will be applied
 to the mailing.

<p>Customers must record their Address Accuracy percentage and expiry
 date obtained from their Statement of Accuracy (SOA) on their
 Order (Statement of Mailing). Failure to record the Address
 Accuracy percentage and expiry date on the Order (Statement
 of Mailing) will result in the application of a surcharge.

<p>Customers are requested to keep a valid copy of the Statement
 of Accuracy (SOA) on file in the event that Canada Post requests
 a copy.

<p>In the case of Incentive Lettermail, Address Accuracy applies
 to Low Density Presort and Machineable mailings greater than
 5,000 items, as well as to High Density Presort mailings greater
 than 500 items deposited in a Letter Carrier office. Customers
 who deposit Short and Long (S/L) High Density Presort mail in
 non-letter carrier offices (not serviced by letter carriers)
 for delivery within that same office, are exempt from the Address
 Accuracy requirements. All other requirements to access the
 High Density Presort service option must be adhered to.

<p>More information on the Address Accuracy Program can be found
 in the Address Accuracy Program Customer Guide, on the Canada
 Post website at www.canadapost.ca/address_management or from
 a Canada Post Representative.

<p> Address Validation,  Address Correction and  Postal Code Look-Up

<p>Canada Post recognizes several software packages that provide
 mailers with automated means to perform address validation,
 address correction and postal code lookup.
