<p>Top notch collection
 Excellent collection of recordings by the
 Chicago-born artist. Major tracks that were major hits, Satisfied,
 Hold on to the Nights, Right Here Waiting, Angelina, Endless
 Summer Nights, Should Have Known Better as well as Hazard. Especially
 liked Keep Coming Back with the magnificent vocals of the late
 Luther Vandross. Marx covers his career of music on this one
 CD. Has nice dance songs as well as the soft ballads, Enjoy!

<p>High Quality Collection
 This is a great collection of songs
 from Marx. Since his 1987 debut, he has evolved over the years.
 From the first album, you get "Endless Summer Nights," "Hold
 On To The Nights" and "Should Have Known Better". There are
 good songs as well off his follow-up Repeat Offender as well
 as from Rush Street. His ballads are very powerful and hit any
 mood you may be in. He is also versatile and that he can rock,
 see "Satisfied" and "Take This Heart". This is a complete compilation
 of a talented artist with moving comments of each song's history.
