<p>Campaign Against Arms Trade, which includes the group Christian
 Campaign Against Arms Trade, is calling for an end to the unfair
 political influence which arms companies have on Government
 policy.

<p>
 Protestors, including Christians, will seek to highlight the
 'revolving door' between arms companies and the Government in
 an election protest this morning.

<p>
Demonstrators are protesting outside the Annual General Meeting
 of the world’s fourth largest arms manufacturer, BAE Systems
 PLC at The Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre, in Westminster,
 London. 

<p>
A door, resembling the door to Number 10 Downing Street, set
 on an axis so it can rotate with an actor dressed as Tony Blair
 will invite two BAE Systems businessmen into number 10 with
 a banner backdrop reading ’BAE Systems: Take Them Out of Number
 10’ outside the AGM venue.

<p>
'Shareholder activists' will also attend the AGM. 

<p>
Campaign Against Arms Trade, which includes the group Christian
 Campaign Against Arms Trade, is calling for an end to the unfair
 political influence which arms companies have on Government
 policy.

<p>
The revolving door between Government and arms companies is
 one of the mechanisms that allows arms companies inappropriate
 access to Government and ’corporate capture’, say campaigners.
 

<p>
CAAT’s new campaign ’Call the Shots’ aims to redress the public
 interest by exposing these mechanisms and calling for safeguards
 to be introduced.

<p>
Anna Jones, a spokesperson for Campaign Against Arms Trade said;
 "Under the Labour Government, as with previous administrations,
 it’s been business as usual for arms exports to repressive regimes
 and conflict zones. The new incumbents to 10 Downing Street
 should put the public interest first and remove the mechanisms,
 like the ’revolving door’, which allow arms companies to capture
 arms export policy."
