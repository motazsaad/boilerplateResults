<h>Trapping Regulations

<p>Definition of Trapping To trap means to take, kill or capture
 wildlife with traps, deadfalls and other devices commonly used
 to take wildlife, including the shooting or killing of lawfully
 trapped animals. It also includes all related activities such
 as placing, setting, staking or checking traps or assisting
 another person with these activities.

<p>Required for persons who have never possessed a trapping license.
 The trapping course is at least 8 hours in length and is free.
 For information on trapper education courses in your area, contact
 the nearest DEC regional Sportsman Ed Coordinator. 

<p>Beaver, otter, bobcat, fisher and marten must have a plastic
 seal attached to the pelt or unskinned animal before:

<l>It is sold or ownership is transferred to another person, or

<l>It is mounted or tanned, or

<l>It leaves New York State, or

<l>10 days have passed since the close of the season where the fur
 was taken.

<l>
 The plastic pelt seals can be removed when the pelt is processed
 for taxidermy, tanning or manufacturing.

<p>Here is how you get your pelts sealed. It is a 2 step process.

<l>A possession tag must be filled out for each animal you take.

<l>Possession tags must be filled out immediately after you reach
 your motor vehicle, camp or home, whichever comes first.

<l>Possession tags must stay with the animal or pelt at all times
 but they do not need to be attached to the pelt.

<p>Step 2&#8212; Getting your pelt sealed All Species

<l>A completed furbearer possession tag must be submitted to obtain
 a plastic pelt seal.

<l>You can give your pelts to another person (other than a taxidermist)
 so he or she can get the pelts sealed or get them skinned. You
 must give that person your trapping license or a copy of your
 license and your completed possession tags while he or she has
 your pelts.

<p>Beaver

 FAX (518) 402-8925 or in person.

<l>You also may report a beaver using the  DECALS call-in system.
 Call 1-866-GAME-RPT.

<l>Once you have submitted your possession tag(s) for beaver you
 will be sent or given the plastic pelt seal(s) and instructions.

<l>Immediately upon receipt of seal(s), you must attach the seal(s)
 to the pelt(s).

<p>Otter, Bobcat, Fisher and Marten 

<l>Only authorized Department representatives can attach the plastic
 pelt seals to otter, bobcat, fisher or marten.

<l>Call the regional wildlife office to make arrangements to get
 your otter, bobcat, fisher, or marten sealed.

<l>Species requiring a pelt seal cannot be bought or sold or given
 to another person unless it has the plastic pelt seal on it.
 All other species may be bought, sold, and transported without
 restriction.
