<p>Evelyn Mary Mackintosh began her service with the Women's Royal
 Naval Service in February 1918 and ended when she died in December
 of the same year. 

<p>Evelyn was born 22nd October 1895 to Duncan H. and Louisa M.
 Mackintosh in Tientsin, North China where her father worked
 for the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank. She was described as &#8220;a
 very healthy jolly looking girl of the Officer type&#8221; who
 was "very keen to go to the East" by Edith A May, Divisional
 Director for Scotland, W.R.N.S.

<p>In November 1918 she volunteered for service at Bizerta, a strategically
 important seaport in Tunisia, as a decoder and was highly recommended
 by her commanding officer, Captain H.J. Rowley. She was turned
 down as she "had no decoding training". This inspite of a report
 written by Edith A May describing the nature of her work in
 Captain Rowley's office as being "decoding and confidential
 transport work".
