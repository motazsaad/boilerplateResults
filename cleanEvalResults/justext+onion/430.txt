<h>Para Red: latest news, advice and recalls

<p>The latest products are being withdrawn from sale by the companies
 concerned. They are in addition to the 66 issued on 5, 6 and
 9 May 2005.

<p>The Agency's advice to consumers remains the same. The amounts
 of Para Red found in the spices are very low. At the levels
 found, the risk from eating any of these foods is very small,
 but as a precaution it would be sensible not to eat them. 

<p>The affected foods are listed below. If you have any of them
 at home you can contact the store, or the manufacturer you bought
 it from, for a refund. 

<p>These latest products were made using contaminated spices from
 the same source as those products identified previously by the
 Agency.

<p>The Agency will continue to work with the UK food industry to
 establish whether any other companies have been supplied with
 contaminated spices. 

<p>This list will be updated as the Agency is informed of further
 affected products and people should also look out for in-store
 notices and other publicity about affected products.

<h>Background

<p>The contamination of spices with illegal dyes is a European-wide
 issue and the Agency has been pressing the European Commission
 to lead a co-ordinated approach to the issue.

<p>The Agency’s Director of Food Safety Dr Andrew Wadge said: 'Para
 Red, like Sudan I, is an illegal dye that should not be in food.
 People understandably don’t expect or want it to be in their
 food. At the levels being found the risk is likely to be very
 small indeed, but it is right that food businesses are removing
 these products from sale. 

<p>'We are pleased that the European Commission is going to develop
 a European-wide approach to tackling this issue. Concerted action
 across Europe is the most effective way forward.' 

<p>Para Red is an industrial dye that is not permitted for use in
 food. It is chemically similar to Sudan I, a dye that was implicated
 in the contamination of other food products in February. The
 Agency’s independent scientific experts advise that it would
 be prudent to assume that Para Red, like Sudan I, could be a
 genotoxic carcinogen, which means it could cause cancer by damaging
 DNA, and so exposure to it should be as low as reasonably practical.

<p>The contaminated spice was supplied by Spanish company, Ramon
 Sabater, and is believed to originate in Uzbekistan. Following
 confirmation of contamination, the FSA issued notices to the
 companies concerned that the products should be recalled on
 Tuesday 3 May. The companies concerned have been co-operating
 with the FSA in compiling and checking product lists since then.
