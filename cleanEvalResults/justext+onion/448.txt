<p>State economic development professionals who are responsible
 for attracting business investment and providing site selection
 assistance to executives and their consultants were invited
 in April 2006 to provide an informative article on this simple
 topic : "Why should a business invest in your state?"

<p>The article content and size was entirely discretionary to share
 their point of view as a free service to our 500,000+ visitors
 in 2006.

<p>We publish their  "Point of View" articles here for convenient
 reference by executives.  Other replies will be published once
 they are received from the remaining state officials.

 at other events where we could meet?  We attend various trade
 shows and professional events each year for networking purposes.

<p>Contact us (TEL 847-304-4655)  if you would like to meet to introduce
 ourselves.

<p>Our Event Recall feature makes it easy to discover which areas

<p>We expect 550,000+ visitors in 2006 to take advantage of the
 extensive information we share about economic development agencies
 and professional services.  That is up 175%+ from 200,000 visits
 in 2004 - the year when we launched this website.  See our daily
 visit or  monthly visit graphs and  regional analysis.  After
 only 3 years, our visit levels already exceed most of the specialty
 magazines in this market even though they have been in circulation
 for 20 - 50 years.

<p>This is a personal service for executives and advisors - not
 just website content and links.   Tell us what you need to find
 for your project, and we will help you in confidence.

<p> Although we make it easy to find thousands of useful resources
 worldwide through this website, we primarily share market knowledge
 personally in response to specific requests from executives
 about their interests, such as well-qualified referrals.

<p>Please  contact us to discuss how our work could support your
 interests.

<p>We apply our research capabilities and extensive networks of
 contacts and working relationships beyond the extensive published
 content of this website.  We are also experimenting with Google
 Groups as another way to openly share market knowledge.

<p>Virus warning : Hackers continue to spoof our published e-mail
 address or use fictitious addresses with our domain name as
 they send out spam or infected messages.  Messages which may
 appear to be from us do not actually come from any of our systems.
  Please refer to our latest information about known attacks
 of this nature.

<p> Our actual outbound e-mails to our contacts are sent from an
 unpublished address, and are very specific in their subject
 lines about the content.  They rarely have any file attachments
 unless the recipient knows us well and is expecting to receive
 the file per prior correspondence.

<p>The new website includes some unique search features, such as
 those highlighted through links below (Area Search, USA Search,
 CRE Search, etc.).  These make it easy for executives and their
 advisors to selectively search relevant websites for additional
 details beyond the executive summary content and links which
 we provide.

<p> Congratulations : to Grameen Bank, Bangladesh - and to economist
 Muhammad Yunus

<p>Congratulations to 2006 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Muhammad Yunus
 and the Grameen Bank he founded to promote local economic development
 and alleviate poverty through microcredit programs.

<p>These enabled small groups of poor people in Bangladesh to access
 unsecured loans in very small amounts for their own self-help
 business efforts which would not be possible through the traditional
 bank loan processes.  This made it possible for many poor people
 to find their own path out of poverty through their work and
 savings, rather than rely on high-cost sources of capital or
 continuous government aid, social programs, or charity.  This
 development model has been repeated elsewhere as an effective
 approach to poverty reduction challenges, and adopted by various
 non-profit charitable organizations as a way to leverage the
 economic impact of their limited resources.

<p>The Nobel Lecture by the winner, typically in December, should
 be a very interesting presentation, as was the 2004 Lecture
 when  Prof. Wangari Muta Maathai of Kenya won it for her Green
 Belt Movement's contributions to sustainable development, democracy
 and peace..

<p>One of the interesting concepts promoted by Muhammad Yunus and
 others is the idea of "non-loss" companies with a clear social
 purpose as their main objective.  In short, they are managed
 like for-profit business ventures, but are not managed for profit
 maximization, but rather to maximize the desired social impact
 of their work.

<p>This differs from the typical nature of "non profit" organizations,
 which may similarly focus on trying to achieve good social outcomes,
 but perhaps more from the perspective of raising and distributing
 money or other benefits as charity rather than by managing the
 process for demonstrable results as in a business venture.

<p>In other words, a non-profit may measure activity (how much it
 has given away and to how many) rather than results (what has
 been changed to achieve sustainable social or economic progress
 beyond immediate crisis-response).  This concept of business-like
 social ventures has started to catch on with philanthropic business
 leaders who want to achieve lasting results, as reflected in
 some of the resources listed in our Humanitarian / Philanthropy
 directory.
