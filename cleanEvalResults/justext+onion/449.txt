<p>&ldquo;Who is this Jesus?&rdquo; A recent issue of U.S. News
 &amp; World Report has Jesus on the cover and claims that &ldquo;America
 is once again rethinking the Messiah.&rdquo; The article in
 this issue addresses the runaway popularity of the book titled
 The DaVinci Code and discusses the centuries old debate around
 Christ&rsquo;s identity. But why is there so much disagreement,
 even conflict, over the identity of this one person? After all,
 isn&rsquo;t Jesus just like all the other religious leaders
 of history, someone who offered some teachings and collected
 a band of followers? 

<p>"... the claims of Jesus in the Bible leave us with only two
 options. We either believe his claim or we reject it... " 

<p>Well yes, in that sense Jesus was just like all the other religious
 leaders, but he was also very different in one respect. Jesus
 was different, because he made a special claim that none of
 the other religious leaders made. Jesus claimed to be God. He
 said that, &ldquo;If you have seen me, then you&rsquo;ve seen
 the Father. I and the Father are one.&rdquo; (John 10:30) That&rsquo;s
 the reason there is so much conflict over his identity, that&rsquo;s
 the reason men and women have debated for centuries about who
 Jesus is.

<p>Buddha didn&rsquo;t make that claim, neither did Mohammed or
 Confucius. But Jesus said, &ldquo;I AM the Way, and the Truth,
 and the Life, no one comes to the Father but through me.&rdquo;
 (John 14:6) Jesus claimed to be God come to earth and that his
 death on the cross would bring forgiveness of sin to all who
 would receive it as a free gift. That&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s
 so much controversy, because the claims of Jesus in the Bible
 leave us with only two options. We either believe his claim
 or we reject it, and everyone must decide for themselves whether
 Jesus really is God. 

<p>And for some, Jesus&rsquo; claim to divinity is way too far fetched.
 The notion of God being born in a stable is more than they can
 get their mind around, so many simply label him as a great religious
 teacher and dismiss his claim to divinity. And it&rsquo;s true,
 Jesus was a great teacher. The ethical teachings of Jesus are
 without equal, &ldquo;Do unto others as you would have them
 do unto you.&rdquo; (Matthew 7:12) His Sermon on the Mount is
 recognized by Christians and non-Christians alike as one of
 the most brilliant moral essays in all of history. 

<p>Yet, it&rsquo;s because of his brilliance that we can&rsquo;t
 simply label him a great teacher. You see great teachers don&rsquo;t
 lie, and Jesus insisted that he was God. A great moral educator
 wouldn&rsquo;t allow others to believe that he was God and encourage
 them to rely upon him for salvation if it wasn&rsquo;t true.
 A good teacher would present the truth and give his students
 help in this life, not fill their heads with nonsense about
 the forgiveness of sin through his death and resurrection. 

<p>Jesus even allowed others to treat him as God, receiving their
 worship. Do you remember the week before his crucifixion he
 paraded into Jerusalem on the back of a donkey and the crowd
 chanted &ldquo;Hosanna in the highest!&rdquo;? (Luke 19), praise
 due only to God. So we&rsquo;re boxed into a corner, because
 we all know that a great moral teacher wouldn&rsquo;t knowingly
 lie to people about his identity. So he&rsquo;s either God,
 just as he claimed, or he was a brilliant liar, but he can&rsquo;t
 be both.

<p>Could he have been a liar though? Could he have been born to
 a poor carpenter and his wife, in a small insignificant town
 in a tiny nation and at the age of 30 began preaching in the
 countryside, developing a following, only to spin what is possibly
 the single largest hoax in all of human history? That&rsquo;s
 a little hard to believe. In fact, I find it harder to believe
 in his success as a liar than in his claim to deity. The liars
 theory just doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me. Small lies aren&rsquo;t
 easy to cover up; imagine covering the grandest of lies, a claim
 to divinity. On top of that, imagine large crowds following
 you around for 3 years listening to your teaching and religious
 scholars scrutinizing your every word and working to try and
 trap you so that they can discredit you. Imagine how hard it
 would have been to spin a lie that elaborate and not get caught.
 How could he have kept it all straight without being found out
 or just collapsing under the shear weight of the criticism?
 

<p>And that&rsquo;s why the liars theory doesn&rsquo;t make sense
 to me because Jesus doesn&rsquo;t have a liars M.O. (modus operandi).
 Liars, especially of this magnitude, are inconsistent and confusing,
 because they are constantly having to back track and adjust
 the story to fit reality. Yet nothing about what Jesus has to
 say sounds like double speak. While liars always have to spin
 the truth, one of the most notable elements of Jesus&rsquo;
 character is his brazen honesty. Even while hanging on the cross,
 he remains perfectly consistent in his message, promising to
 meet the thief hanging next to him in paradise. Liars don&rsquo;t
 act like this. Liars coerce and connive and manipulate, so that
 they don&rsquo;t end up on a cross. 

<p>The notion that Jesus is a liar doesn&rsquo;t fit. Of course
 now some suggest that maybe he was self-deceived, meaning that
 he was crazy and didn&rsquo;t realize he was telling lies. After
 all, people can be sincere, and still be sincerely wrong. Maybe
 he was out of his mind and just didn&rsquo;t know any better.
 Maybe he was a lunatic like David Koresh or Jim Jones, claiming
 to be God, and completely believing the non-sense. That would
 explain his behavior wouldn&rsquo;t it? 

<p>No it wouldn&rsquo;t. When Charles Manson makes the claims to
 deity we discount him because he&rsquo;s obviously unstable.
 He&rsquo;s crazy and no one doubts it, but Jesus demonstrated
 perfect emotional balance and health, even in the face of some
 of life&rsquo;s worst ordeals. If you or I have a bad day at
 work, then we&rsquo;re tempted to take it out on the family,
 the slightest bit of pressure in our lives causes us to act
 out, we buckle under the pressure and our behavior changes accordingly.
 But Jesus remained perfectly consistent, calm and collected,
 even in face of life&rsquo;s worst possible experiences. 

<p>Take his trial for example, with people accusing him, beating
 him and pressing him to simply change his story and give up
 his claim to deity, Jesus refuses and appears unflappable as
 his life hangs in the balance. In fact, while others would have
 snapped in anger and bitterness at being betrayed by friends
 and falsely accused Jesus responds in kindness, considering
 the needs of others. On the cross he cries out Father forgive
 them because they don&rsquo;t understand what they are doing.
 Then he spots his mother in the crowd, while he&rsquo;s hanging
 on the cross and he calls out to his friend John, who is also
 looking on, and asks that he would take care of her after he&rsquo;s
 gone. Jesus is anything but crazy, unless you consider kindness
 and mercy in the face of mistreatment and torture crazy. 

<p>Remember, Jesus wasn&rsquo;t crucified because he was tried and
 found to be a liar or because he was crazy and made no sense.
 Jesus was crucified because the religious elite were threatened
 by the credibility of his claim and the obvious sanity in his
 personality, which they felt were a threat to their power. If
 you remember, the Roman authority Pilate washed his hands of
 the whole thing, not wanting to be implicated in the wrongful
 death of an innocent man, but too politically savvy to disappoint
 the Jews. 

<p>So as I survey the short list of possibilities, Jesus can&rsquo;t
 possibly be a liar because a liar would do his best to avoid
 crucifixion and Jesus willingly dies for us. Jesus can&rsquo;t
 possibly be crazy either because crazy people buckle under pressure,
 especially the type of pressure he experienced. The only answer
 available to the question &ldquo;Who is this Jesus?&rdquo; is
 that he is God. The prophet Isaiah was right, this is Immanuel,
 &ldquo;God with us.&rdquo; And as hard as it can be to get our
 finite minds to understand the infinite reality of God dieing
 on a cross for us, that is the power of the Christian message.
 And if you have never opened your life to God, then I want to
 encourage you to pray and receive his Jesus. The death and resurrection
 of Jesus Christ is the gift of God to mankind. Don&rsquo;t refuse
 the gift. It&rsquo;s a simple prayer saying, God I&rsquo;ve
 recognize your coming as baby to this earth and your death and
 resurrection for me as a gift. I receive your gift. Thank You.
