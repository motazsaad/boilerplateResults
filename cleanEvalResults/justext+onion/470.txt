<h>Undergraduate Minor in Education

<h>The Program

<p>The Teacher Education Institute does not offer a program leading
 to an undergraduate degree, however it does offer undergraduate
 students a minor in education that introduces students to the
 profession of education and provides students an opportunity
 to explore education as a career and obtain a head start on
 their coursework leading to initial teacher certification through
 the University at Buffalo’s graduate school program, but this
 minor cannot in itself lead directly to teacher certification.

<p>Although intended for those who will pursue certification in
 Adolescence education (Grades 7-12), the minor can be adapted
 for those interested in Early Childhood Education (birth to
 Grade 2) and/or Childhood Education (Grades 1-6).

<h>Acceptance Criteria

<p>Registration is open to students who formally apply to the minor
 and who receive confirmation of acceptance prior to registration.
 Applications to the minor must be filed with the Teacher Education
 Institution (TEI) office in 375 Baldy Hall. Applications must
 include UB DARS report and/or official transcripts from all
 institutions attended other than UB. Students must have a minimum
 GPA of 2.5 for admission. 

<h>Course Sequence

<p>The minor in education consists of 19 credits as described below.

<h>Required Courses

<p>* May be applicable to Adolescence initial teacher certification
 program at UB
 + May be applicable to Childhood initial/professional
 teacher certification program at UB
 # May be applicable to
 Early Childhood initial/professional teacher certification program
 at UB 

<h>
Recommended Sequence of Courses

<h>First Year (sophomore year)

<p>Spring: LAI 350 (prerequisite for CEP 400 & ELP 405)

<h>Second Year

<p>Fall: CEP 400, ELP 405 (prerequisite for LAI 414) 
 Spring: LAI
 414 or elective 

<h> Third Year

<p>Fall: Two courses from the list of electives

<p>The first course (LAI 350) in the minor is an introductory course
 that is not part of the required coursework for certification.
 It does, however, have a field experience component, and early
 field experiences are required in the latest NYS Education Department
 regulations. 

<p>The next two courses, CEP 400 and ELP 405, can be used to meet
 requirements for initial certification as an Adolescence teacher.
 The final three courses in the minor are electives, which may
 also meet teacher certification course requirements (depending
 upon which curricular option the student eventually pursues).

<p>Students who take CEP 400, ELP 405, and LAI 414, and complete
 them successfully, and who later pursue a UB program leading
 to initial teacher certification at the Adolescence level may
 include these courses in their coursework toward initial certification
 (but not the master’s degree). This allows students to have
 a 9-credit head start toward their initial certification.

<h>Provisional Admission into the Teacher Certification Program

<p>Students who have completed 75 undergraduate credits in an approved
 major with a minimum GPA of 3.0 can apply on-line to an initial
 certification (i.e., advanced certificate without an Ed.M. degree)
 or initial/professional certification program (with Ed.M. degree)
 for provisional admission pending completion of their undergraduate
 degree. Students who have been provisionally admitted and who
 have completed 90 undergraduate credits may take two graduate
 level education courses (upon advisement) and include them in
 their graduate program in education.
