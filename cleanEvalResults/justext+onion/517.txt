<p>For many reasons, politicians all over the world are becoming
 increasingly supportive of telework and telecommuting. This
 listing of American elected officials (current and past) support
 and endorse telework.  Contact us if you know of others.

<p>Bill, SB 2021 Starting in 2001, qualified employers and employees
 in Los Angeles, Orange, and Ventura will be eligible for a $500
 tax credit if they use telework and other alternative work arrangements
 to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality and worker
 productivity. Only newly created positions would be eligible,
 and employees also must travel a minimum of nine miles to their
 workplace and commute outside of times other than normal "rush
 hours"

<p>  

<p>-

<p>Governor Pete Wilson '94: In an open letter to all California
 executives: "Telecommuting also must play a role (in reducing
 the number of cars. A telecommuting program at your firm can
 help solve transportation challenges and improve our air quality
 and regional mobility. It also can cut your costs and improve
 your employees productivity."

<p>  

<p>-

<p>Gov't Code, S. 14200-14203: "The Legislature finds and declares
 the following: That telecommuting can be an important means
 to reduce air pollution and traffic congestion and to reduce
 the high costs of highway commuting; that telecommuting stimulates
 employee productivity while giving workers more flexibility
 and control over their lives. It is the intent of the Legislature
 to encourage state agencies to adopt policies that encourage
 telecommuting by state employees."

<p>  

<p>-

<p> Assemblymember Liz Fugueroa: Introduced a bill into the California
 State Assembly that authorized a $200 tax credit for each new
 qualified residential teleworking position and a $100 tax credit
 for each new qualified teleworking center position created during
 the taxable year by the taxpayer and staffed by an hourly or
 salaried employee residing in California during the taxable
 year. (Bill died in committee)

<p>31 Colorado Mayors urge Colorado businesses to consider telework
 to help solve critical business and transformation issues, including
 the ongoing challenge to attract and retain highly skilled workers
 in a tight job market.

<p>Sept 2005: The Telecommuter Tax Fairness Act proposed by Senators
 Chris Dodd (D-CT), and Joseph Lieberman (D-CT), and Representatives
 Christopher Shays (R-CT), Tom Davis (R-VA), and Rosa DeLauro
 (D-CT) seeks to remove a state-based penalty tax on interstate
 telecommuting. 

<p>According to Representative Shays, "Telework is a critical tool
 to help lower spiraling gas costs and our dependence on foreign
 oil. The Telecommuter Tax Fairness Act would facilitate telework
 by prohibiting a punitive tax on Americans who work from home
 for out-of-state employers. This is the time to make telecommuting
 easier for Americans, not harder," he said. "I am glad to have
 the support of The Telework Coalition in the effort to empower
 more Americans to conserve fuel by telecommuting."

<p>  

<p>-

<p>CT Senator Chris Dodd to introduce a measure in the senate that
 will protect Connecticut telecommuters from having to pay a
 second income tax to the state of New York. See story here

<p>  

<p>-

<p>State set aside $55 million to urge commuters to opt for commuting
 options including telecommuting and other . Governor Rowland
 said: "The choices are very simple:....When to go to work; Where
 to work from; and How to get to work"

<p>  

<p>-

<p>TelecommuteCT is a $.5 million program to help state employers
 design and implement telecommuting programs

<p>2006 Georgia. State gives tax breaks to firms who let workers
 telework. It will give employers

<l>a state income tax credit of up to $20,000 if they conduct telework
 feasibility study

<l> a tax credit of up to $1,200 per employee if they implement
 telework programs.  Details here

<p>  

<p>-

<p> Georgia bill would jump-start telework. Telecommuting may finally
 be poised to take off in Georgia after years of false starts.
 A pair of bills now before the state House of Representatives
 would reward employers with annual tax credits of up to $1,500
 for each employee who works a certain amount of time from home
 rather than the office. Supporters say incentives will encourage
 companies that have been slow to get their employees out of
 their cubicles and off the roads. Gov. Sonny Perdue championed
 telecommuting during his 2002 campaign and has backed the idea
 of state financial assistance

<p>  

<p>-

<p> Georgia State teleworking initiative has had trouble revving
 up. Officials blame budget and legal constraints for problems
 they have had getting only 1,500 Georgia state employees are
 teleworking at least one day a month, two years after Gov. Sonny
 Perdue said the number would be 25,000 - or roughly 25 percent
 of the state government's workforce - by 2005

<p>Governor Zell Miller '98: Mandated all 26,000 state employees
 to reduce solo trips to and from work by 20% on Ozone Action
 Days....telework is an ideal commute option. When an ozone alert
 is issued, practiced teleworkers can easily collect enough work
 to be highly productive at home, playing their part in reducing
 emissions and single occupancy vehicles during peak congestion
 periods".

<p>Gov. John Baldacci  signs executive order to reduce greenhouse
 gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2010. He has asked state officials
 to review and report on existing telecommuting programs by January
 2005. He wants the State to assume a leadership role in addressing
 the serious risk of climate change by promoting more efficient
 use of energy in the transportation sector

<p>Maryland

<p>  

<p>-

<p>Apr 04 Bill supporting tax incentives for private companies offering
 telecommuting programs in Maryland made it through the House
 by a 139 to 0 vote, but died in the Senate. Will try again next
 year.

<p>  

<p>-

<p>Mar 04:  Telework legislation (House Bill 1101) offers over half
 million over three years to help employers and teleworkers.
 Employers would get tax credit of up to 25% of telework costs
 (up to $5,000/yr). A side bill mandates telework for state employees
 (sort of like the federal telework law)

<p>  

<p>-

<p>Maryland's DOT initiates The Telework Partnership Offers free
 professional telework consulting services to Maryland Employers.
 Also, the state's Telecommuting Pilot Program requires a statewide
 telecommuting pilot program for all government agencies 

<p>Feb 2002: Sue Hecht of the Maryland House of Delegates submits
 "Telework Tax Incentive Act". Aim is to provide a $500 tax credit
 for employees and/or employers to promote teleworking in the
 private sector

<p>  

<p>-

<p>Governor Parris Glendening (2000) offers 'pay-me-not-to-drive'
 incentives to employers and employees to address traffic and
 air pollution problems. Gives a special pay boost for lower
 wage workers while saving employers money

<p>  

<p>-

<p>Establishes $600,000 fund to help employers establish telework
 programs to reduce traffic congestion and improve the quality
 of life of state residents. Signs into law the state's Telecommuting
 Pilot Program which requires the establishment of a statewide
 telecommuting pilot program for all government agencies.

<p>Senator Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. introduces Rural Telework Act
 of 2000 to provide funding to local organizations to help train,
 connect and then employ rural workers to do "telework" jobs
 in the information technology field in their own communities.

<p>  

<p>-

<p>Statute s. 15.95 sub. 10 '94 Says no state agency may propose
 or implement a capital investment plan for a state building
 unless it receives approval from the state for increasing telecommuting
 by employees who would normally work in the building, or can
 prove that such a plan is not practicable.

<p>Montana passes a bill formally authorizing state agencies to
 promote "teleworking" by employees. The thinking is that telework
 makes employees more productive, reduces office space needs
 and attracts more workers to the labor force. The bill merely
 recognizes that in the law and gives the Legislature some oversight.
 See story  here. See actual  bill here

<p>Telework Feasibility Study published by State Auditor Ralph Campbell
 concluded that if 5% of state employees teleworked, they would
 save over $23 million in improved productivity, reduced  office
 space and turnover costs.

<p>North Virginia

<p>  

<p>-

<p>2003: Gov. Mark R. Warner: Virginia state can't afford to build
 big new highways, so it's looking for smaller, quick-fix solutions,
 including telecommuting, to gridlock. Governor willing to invest
 $20 million for several related projects to ease congestion

<p>Oregon

<p>  

<p>-

<p>The Oregon Department of Energy actively promotes telework because
 it conserves fuel, relieves traffic congestion, and improves
 air quality -- and because it makes good business sense. The
 State has developed an aggressive  Telework Program that: 

<l>helps cities offer state tax credits, low-interest loans, and/or
 other incentives to assist with purchasing and installing new
 or used equipment that allows an employees to telework

<p>Governor Mike Leavitt '99: Proclaimed May 14 as Utah Telecommuting
 Day. Employers were encouraged to allow eligible employees to
 spend the day productively working from home instead of sitting
 in traffic on a congested freeway.

<p>Vermont

<p>  

<p>-

 is hosting a national seminar (June 2004) in Stowe, Vermont

<p>Virginia

<p>  

<p>-

<p>Telework!VA This program exists to reduce overcrowding on Virginia's
 highways, thereby reducing real estate and parking costs; as
 well as improving productivity.  Under the program's $3.2 million
 budget, companies can receive:

<p> - $10,000 toward the cost of leasing equipment (fax machines,
 computers and high-speed Internet connections);
 - up to $35,000
 (or $3,500 per employee), for the cost of telecommuting-related
 equipment and services;

<p>Governor James Gilmore Seeks to offer $10 million in tax incentives
 and grants for companies that let their employees telework rather
 than contributing to rush hour traffic. This addresses two of
 Virginia's most pressing problems: transportation and work force
 shortages.

<p>Washington State

<p>  

<p>-

<p>(June 2001): Governor Gary Locke directs state agencies to dramatically
