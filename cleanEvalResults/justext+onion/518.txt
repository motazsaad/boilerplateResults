<p>It is imperative at this time for a clear statement to be made
 with regard to the direction in which A Course In Miracles is
 being taken by its custodians, the Foundation for Inner Peace,
 and the impact which it will have upon the Course, itself, together
 with the unconsidered element - the students of the Course,
 and the fact that it is they and not the Course who will be
 the transforming Presence of love which will precipitate Awakening.

<p>There is a plan being carried out by the Foundation which has
 as its goal the protection of the purity of the Course, and
 this is slowly being accomplished by the creation of certain
 structures which, when activated, will allow control of the
 dissemination of the Course and Course-related materials.

<p>The Course was naturally and appropriately copyrighted in 1975,
 thus giving the publisher the necessary means to keep the Course
 present in the world in its original form without being altered
 in any way. This act of copyrighting, whether of the original
 or any subsequent translations, [is] its protection, and nothing
 further is incumbent upon the publisher in order for its responsibility
 to be fully discharged.

<p>However, the publisher has taken it upon itself to do [more]
 than that, and as a result the words, "A Course In Miracles"
 have been registered and trademarked [and] the letters "ACIM"
 have been incorporated into a logo which will appear on all
 new copies of the Course. The logo, of course, will become a
 registered trademark, thus insuring the unavailability of "ACIM"
 for use by students of the Course to identify [their] study
 groups, seminars, conferences, community center, etc. Indeed,
 according to Judy Skutch, as each new translation is published,
 not only will "A Course In Miracles" be trademarked in that
 language, the translated equivalent of "ACIM" will also be trademarked.

<p>While the trademark policy was being developed and implemented,
 there was a simultaneous alliance which was conceptualized between
 the Foundation for Inner Peace and the Foundation for A Course
 In Miracles in Roscoe, New York, headed by Dr. Kenneth Wapnick,
 and in a public statement they were dubbed "sister foundations,"
 thus distinguishing the Foundation For A Course In Miracles
 from all other foundations using "A Course In Miracles" in their
 names and assuring it the right to [continue] using it after
 all others are asked to cease and desist.

<p>In addition, while all of this was happening, the Foundation
 For A Course In Miracles incorporated a new concept and function,
 that of being an Academy. It was a subtle shift, allowing those
 who had attended lectures on any number of topics relative to
 the Course in past years to unconsciously re-identify those
 talks as "lectures" at the "Academy." It had a nice formal feel
 of academia, and since the publicity of the move likened the
 "Academy" to Plato's Academy, it conveyed a feeling of integrity.

<p>Since then there have been unpublicized moves to ask those identifying
 themselves as "teachers" of the Course, even some quite well
 known to those in the growing Course community, to cease calling
 themselves teachers.

<p>What has not been apparent to those who haven't recognized the
 "signs of the times," is that before long it will be announced
 that classes for prospective teachers of "A Course In Miracles"
 will be given at the Academy and, upon graduation, "certification"
 will be conferred, [and] these individuals will be the only
 ones who will be able to freely use "A Course In Miracles" and
 "ACIM" relative to their teaching activities or teaching-related
 publications.

<p>You see, a shift occurred and the custodians of the "Course"---
 the particular sequence of words, numbers, and punctuation marks
 which are uniquely identifiable as "A Course In Miracles" -
 have metamorphosed into the teachers and protectors of its [meaning].
 This is [not] the charge that was given them, and it is inconsistent
 with the Course, which, in all respects, is a self-teaching
 course.

<p>I understand that "A Course In Miracles" [can] be read as a spiritual
 psychology which, when brought to bear on human experience,
 will transform human relationships, and that therefore, like
 any other psychology text, it can be treated as an academic
 text - taught precept upon precept, line upon line. But such
 a conceptual context constitutes a gross misapprehension of
 what it really is.

<p>"A Course In Miracles" can [only] be self-taught. It is, by its
 very structure, an intimate interaction between the reader and
 the material read. And because [its] curriculum was established
 by the Father's Intent for the Sonship to be consciously Whole,
 [it] cannot fail in its Purpose. You must understand therefore,
 that no "human" teacher can know the divine Intent of the words
 perceived by the individual reader [for] the reader, and that
 if, indeed, the teacher [did] know the divine Intent, he would
 find himself putting It into words which, although as hopelessly
 original as those in the "Course", would [not] be the words
 in the Course.

<p>It is in the inviolable intimacy of the student and the Holy
 Spirit's curriculum that Remembering occurs. It is in that uninvadable
 intimacy, where no other teacher [can] enter, that the journey
 without distance occurs. It is in that intimate experience of
 Love that the Wholeness of the Sonship is consciously realized.

<p>I will tell you something: When a child is delivered, there is
 for a brief moment no more wonderful person in the world than
 the doctor or midwife who facilitated the event. But, the infatuation
 passes and the doctor, mother and child move on. Likewise, those
 who facilitated the entry of "A Course In Miracles" into the
 human experience --- and for whom all who have experienced its
 phenomenal meaning have the greatest admiration, respect, and
 even love --- must let the child go and do its work without
 hovering around it to ensure that no one misunderstands it or
 mistreats it, protecting it from the world [it] came to deliver
 into the Father's hands by means of the [Holy Spirit's] curriculum.

<p>Do not misunderstand. It is with great gratitude that I look
 upon their work in "delivering" the Course and continuing to
 extend it through translations into other languages. But I ask
 them to be alert and not stifle the child by attending to anything
 more than its continuing presence, unaltered from the form in
 which the unknowable Intent of the Holy Spirit makes [itself]
 known.

<p>I will tell you something else: A "certifiable" teacher of "A
 Course In Miracles" is one who teaches from the state of communion
 [on the spot] and not from "learning." Let not the students,
 the teachers, or the midwives forget this and they will not
 become confused as to their duties.

<p>I am in agreement with the words "A Course In Miracles" being
 trademarked and used only as the title of the book published
 by the Foundation for Inner Peace. I agree that its use in the
 names of groups, associations, newsletters, foundations and
 any [title] of any kind should cease, so that it may be found
 [only on the one book so named]. But I gently declare that the
 letters "ACIM" and their equivalent in other languages, [need]
 to remain available to students of the Course throughout the
 world as a means of identifying the focus of interest in the
 names of their groups, associations, newsletters, foundations
 and publications, etc., relative to the Course.

<p>In addition, I further declare that the Foundation for ACIM (as
 it would be called) in Roscoe, New York, should claim "sisterhood"
 with all other foundations for ACIM and all other groups of
 students and teachers, having no special relationship with the
 Foundation for Inner Peace.

<p>The moment the Foundation for Inner Peace confirms publicly that
 it will cease promoting a [generic] terms to identify materials
 related to "A Course In Miracles" and [will] allow the unrestricted
 use of the letters ACIM to identify them all, the Northwest
 Foundation for A Course In Miracles will, in mutual agreement,
 immediately initiate steps to change its name to the Northwest
 Foundation for ACIM in harmony and unity with the FFIP's desire
 for harmony and unity.

<p>I ask for this communication to be forwarded to students of the
 Course everywhere, by all means of communication, and to as
 many of the study groups worldwide as it can possibly reach.
 And I ask those students to communicate with the Foundation
 for Inner Peace to register their feeling on these points. The
 need is for simultaneous unity, freedom [and] trust throughout
 the Course community so that the fundamental intimacy of the
 student with the Holy Spirit's curriculum does not become disturbed
 or distracted by fear, dissension, reaction or any apparent
 need for protection from any quarter.
