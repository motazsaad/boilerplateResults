<h>What is history? An introduction to working with original documents
 (Key stage 3, years 7 and 9)

<h>Aims of the workshop

<p>This workshop aims to help students understand about the different
 types of sources that can be used to find out about the past,
 and learn how to use them as evidence for investigating the
 past. It is designed to build on work students have done at
 key stage 2, and prepare them for working with sources at key
 stage 3.

<h>Documents

<p>This workshop does not have specific documents for students to
 use in their preparation activity. The aim of the activity is
 for students to search the National Archives Learning Curve
 website to find examples of different types of documents listed
 on the worksheet.

<p>You can limit students to 'Snapshots' if you wish to make the
 activity simpler, or they can include 'Exhibitions' in their
 search to give them a much broader range of material.

<h>Activity

<p>Students can either work individually or in groups to complete
 the activity. This can be done in the class or set as homework.
 Students will need to have access to a computer and the Internet.

<p>Give each student or group a copy of the worksheet and explain
 that their task is to search through Learning Curve, using 'Exhibitions'
 and 'Snapshots' to try and find an example of each document
 listed on the worksheet. The documents in 'Exhibitions' and
 'Snapshots' are all scanned images of original documents from
 our collection.

<p>The first one, an example of a plan has already been filled in
 to show you what is required. Once students have found an image
 of the document, they need to write down:

<l>Where on Learning Curve they found it (copying and pasting the
 link to the document where possible)

<l>What its date is

<l>What questions they would like to ask about it to help them investigate
 the information in it more closely, and work out how useful
 it might be to them as a source

<p>Before the workshop, ask the students to report back on what
 they have found, and choose the best example of each type of
 source to talk about in the videoconference workshop.

<p>The materials are provided in Adobe PDF format so that they are
 easy to print out. Anyone with a visual impairment who is unable
 to use PDF documents should visit access.adobe.com for information
 about converting documents and versions of Adobe Reader with
 added accessibility features.

<p>If you are unable to print out the preparation materials and
 need us to send you a paper print out, please email education@nationalarchives.gov.uk
 or call 020 8392 5365 and leave a message stating the title
 of the workshop you want the materials for, your name, your
 school's name, and the date of your workshop.

<h>The workshop

<p>There are two versions of the workshop, one for year 7 and one
 for year 9. Both workshops will begin with a brief introduction
 to The National Archives and what is kept here.

<l>Year 7 version: this focuses on using sources to ask and answer
 questions for historical investigations

<l>Year 9 version: this focuses on assessing the reliability and
 usefulness of sources for historical investigations

<h>Year 7 workshop

<p>The workshop will begin with a discussion on the types of documents
 found in an archive, with an opportunity for students to talk
 about examples they found on Learning Curve for the preparation
 exercise. We will then go on to discuss how historians use original
 documents to carry out an historical investigation. Students
 will be asked how they questioned the documents they found for
 the preparation activity, and how they think they might follow
 this up with more research.

<p>The next part of the workshop aims to help the students understand
 how an historical investigation is carried out by putting the
 ideas discussed into practice, with an online investigation.
 The topic chosen for this is based on the Victorians, a subject
 most year 7 students will be familiar with from their KS 2 studies.
 The students will take the lead in carrying out an historical
 investigation from formulating an initial question, to using
 different sources to ask and answer questions, guided by the
 education officer delivering the workshop. They will be asked
 to discuss the usefulness of each document they study, as well
 as where they might look for further answers to the questions
 posed by individual documents. The range of documents used will
 include a map, photograph and census return. After the workshop,
 students will be encouraged to continue the investigation online
 using Learning Curve&rsquo;s Focus On the Census.

<p>The session will conclude with students being shown images of
 some of the most famous documents stored here at the National
 Archives. These will include the Domesday Book, Guy Fawkes confession,
 William Shakespeare&lsquo;s will and the SOS from the doomed
 Titanic. The students will be given the opportunity to ask questions
 at the end of the session.

<h>Year 9 workshop

<p>The workshop will begin with a discussion on the types of documents
 found in an archive, with an opportunity for students to talk
 about examples they found on Learning Curve for the preparation
 exercise. The education officer will then go on to show and
 explain to students some of the more unusual types of documents
 that we have, and explain more about the role of The National
 Archives.

<p>The next part of the workshop will focus on discussing the usefulness
 and reliability of documents to introduce the idea of how they
 can give us very different interpretations of the same event,
 and how they can be adapted or shaped to give a particular point
 of view. The education officer will show images of documents
 to illustrate this, which will pick up on topics that students
 are familiar with from KS 2 such as images of Henry VIII, and
 those they will be going on to study, including the Domesday
 Book.

<p>The concluding discussion will aim to clarify students&lsquo;
 ideas about usefulness and reliability, and how as historians
 they need to work carefully with a wide range of documents to
 understand and interpret the past.

<h>Knowledge, skills and understanding

<l>Getting hands on experience at studying history through a range
 of original documents, such as official reports, correspondence,
 newspaper articles and photographs

<l>Undertaking research activities to gain experience of using historical
 sources critically in their context by comprehending, analysing,
 evaluating and interpreting them

<l>Debating with the education officer leading the workshop, and
 amongst themselves to organise and communicate their knowledge
 and ideas

<h>Objectives and outcomes

<p>Students taking part in this workshop will learn:

<l>That different types of sources can supply different types of
 information

<l>That several different types of source are useful for finding
 out about the past

<l>How to describe and interrogate a source

<l>That even though the information in a source may not be reliable
 (i.e. telling us the truth about an event or person) it can
 still be a very useful source to a historian
