<h>music
explorer

<p> available through 

<p>Music Explorer brings the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted
 by Sir Colin Davis, to you in your home or in your classroom.
 Music Explorer consists of a videotape and a 64 page listening
 guidebook written by Richard McNicol. 

<l>an introductory page that sets the scene, describing the circumstances
 in which the piece was written (where possible, in the composer's
 own words). 

<l>1st listenings: Getting your bearings. Pages that help the listener
 get an overall impression of the music by discovering landmarks
 that give an idea of the span of the piece. 

<l>2nd listenings: Structure. Explores the way the music is put
 together (the form). 

<l>3rd listenings: The icing on the cake. Guides to some of the
 things that make the music most admirable to the author--designed
 to provoke involvement and individual response. This section
 also contains "secrets of the performance" (about gestur es,
 expressions, and interactions among the people making the music
 on the tape) and "can you discover..." (questions to encourage
 students to explore a little further for themselves). 

<l>Gathering the threads. Answers some of the questions brought
 up in the introduction: "How was the first performance received?"
 "What then happens to the composer?" "How does this composer
 fit into musical history?" 

<p>In addition to the performances, the Music Explorer video shows
 various London Symphony Orchestra musicians demonstrating or
 practicing their instruments--and also general backstage views
 of the Orchestra preparing for rehearsal and performance. The
 fo llowing list shows where these scenes are located on the
 video: 

<p>Using Music Explorer in a Standards-based curriculumIdeas adapted
 from Richard McNicol's Music Explorer Project Book

<p> The Music Explorer package includes a variety of printed exercises
 useful for individual or for class study. In addition, author
 Richard McNicol has designed a variety of creative classroom
 projects. Here are six such projects, chosen for their eff ectiveness
 in helping students reach the National Standards in Music Education
 of the United States of America (note that the Music Explorer
 materials all are directed toward Standard 9: Understanding
 music in relation to history and culture). 

<p>Note that the sound files that appear in some of these lessons
 are in MIDI format. You will be able to play them only if your
 computer is set up to accomodate such files, and the sound quality
 will depend on the quality of your computer sound card and other
 hardware. 

<l>Spring. Using Vivaldi's "Spring" from The Four Seasons to teach
 toward 

<l>Standard 4: Composing and arranging music within specific guidelines
 

<l>Standard 8: Understanding relationships between music, the other
