 in you!"

<p>Winter Infidels' Bash!

<p>We're trying out a new location this year. New club-member Randy
 Word has a big ranch down near Granbury, and he's graciously
 allowed us to hold our shindig there. There's plenty of back-to-nature
 stuff to do there (hiking, fishing, etc) and lots of great activities
 for kids. Randy has also offered to smoke a batch of ribs for
 us, so we'll have plenty to eat and do.

<p>We'll likely be having a gift-exchange, so bring along a wrapped
 gift worth under $10 if you'd like to participate.

<p>It also looks like we're going to have a bigger-than-average
 group of young kids there, so if you bring along a wrapped toy
 (please keep it in the under-$5 range), we'll try to do a gift
 exchange for the kiddos. If your kid is older than about 8,
 the grownup exchange would probably be better.

<p>What: Metroplex Atheists Infidels Bash

<p>When: Sunday, December 17, noon until whenever (Randy has a fire-pit
 and cabins if we spend too much time partying) 

<p>Who: YOU! Okay, anyone who's ever been faced annoyance or condemnation
 for not following majority-owned holidays. We'll celebrate any
 winter holiday you'd like.

<p>What To Bring: Randy will be smoking ribs and sausages, but we'll
 need any further fixins. If you'd like to bring some chips or
 soda or dessert or such, email director@metroplexatheists.org
 and I'll help coordinate snacks so we don't end up with twenty
 bowls of dip and no chips.

<p>BYOB 

<p>Where:

<p>Take 377 SW from I20 in SW Fort Worth towards Granbury (Benbrook
 exit).

<p> Stay on 377 thru Cresson and on to Granbury, take 377 Business
 to downtown Granbury (the square with large rock courthouse).

<p> Go to the end of the square (1 block) and turn right on Hwy
 4.

<p> Go thru town and then Hwy 4 angles/turns to the left immediately
 upon crossing the RR tracks.

<p> Continue on Hwy 4 to Thorp Spring. Stay on Hwy 4 to far end
 of town and look for FM 2580. Stay straight on Hwy 4 but immediately
 check your odometer. Go exactly 4.5mi from 2580 intersection
 to the turn into the ranch. There will be a street sign there
 that says "Ruff Country". You can only turn right so turn right
 onto Ruff Country (gravel road)

<p> Again check you odometer and go exactly 0.9mi There will be
 an open steel gate on your right. There is a green street sign
 attached to the gate that says "Randy Rd". Turn right and you
 are now in the ranch.

<p> Continue another 3/4mi on gravel/dirt road that will twist and
 turn and go down a steep hill and eventually across a creek.
 Don't give up, if you take a wrong turn inside the ranch just
 keep driving and you will find it.

<p> Phone numbers: 254 646 2226 (ranch house) or my cell 972 342

<p>Following the closing of the old Humanist Hall in Grapevine,
 we'll be holding our November meeting at the NEW Humanist Hall
 in North Richland Hills. It's a good location with plenty of
 local eateries in reach.

<p>So come see us on the third Sunday at 11 AM (but not in December,
 because that's the party-day).

<p>Issue number 20 (May/June 2006) of Metroplex Atheists' newsletter,
 The Atheist Voice is now available  here. Enjoy!

<p>Metroplex Atheists is an organization for atheists in the Fort

 issues of importance to atheists, and plan activism. Metroplex
 Atheists meet every 3rd Sunday of each month. Please join us
 and meet your neighborhood atheists.

<h>Meeting Time and Place:

<p>It's easy to reach. From Dallas or Fort Worth, get on highway
 114. When you reach the Northwest Highway exit in Grapevine,
 head north 1.4 miles. Turn left on Main for about a block, and
 the building is on the right.

<p>If you want door-to-door directions, click on the map link above,
 then click "get directions".

<p>Social Meetings:

<p>Several members of Metroplex Atheists also meet socially at J.
 Gilligan's bar in Arlington on Wednesday nights. It's on Abrams
 Street just east of the municipal complex. We usually meet around
 6-7 pm. They close at 10 pm, but we're usually out before then.
 Hope to see you there!

<l>Bank of Wisdom CD-ROM's

<p>Metroplex Atheists is an outlet for the Emmett Fields Bank of
 Wisdom CD-ROM collection. These are collections of obscure atheist
 literature available on CD-ROM for low prices. Many of these
 works are very obscure and are only available publicly in these
 collections. The pictured Robert Ingersoll CD, for example,
 contains the entire 12-volume Dresden Edition collection of
 his speeches and writings. This collection would cost over $1000
 if purchased on paper, but you can get it on CD-ROM for around
 $25.

<l>Book Covers And, of course, we sell the infamous book covers
 that caused Pat Robertson to blow a gasket on the set of The
 700 Club. We also ship covers out if you live outside of D/FW.
 You can order them here.

<p>"Because we must. Because we have the call. Because it is nobler
 to fight for rationality without winning than to give up in
 the face of continued defeats. Because whatever true progress
 humanity makes is through the rationality of the occasional
 individual and because any one individual we may win for the
 cause may do more for humanity than a hundred thousand who hug
 superstition to their breasts."

<p>-- Isaac Asimov, when asked why he fights religion with no hope
 for victory
