 they are taking of the impact of fast-moving advances in science
 and technology on how young people think and learn in planning
 future education policy. She draws the attention to the opportunities
  that come with the application of science in children's education.:"There
 is no doubt that with an understanding of how learning occurs,
 some wonderful technologies exist to help us to realize our
 full potential, but applying the technologies in inappropriate
 ways may be changing the very way in which our children think."See

<p>September 2003 
Commence development programme of Phonomena game
 for commercial releaseAugust 2003 MSE Trial results announced
 in MindWeavers' Press Release.July 2003 MW commence development
 of English as an Additional Language (EAL) field trial programme
 with remote language learning partner.June 2003 MSE trial results
 show Phonomena training 'PhAB' average age-equivalent increases
 of 2.4 years after just 4 weeks training.
When re-tested 6 weeks
 after training, a further 0.6 years increase. This shows Phonomena
 develops the learner's own resources (trains the senses) so
 that improvement continues after the training has been completed,
 not only in the listening skills that have been practised, but
 also in standard tests of hearing and speech.June 2003 Phonomena
 first set of field trial results from SLTs announced in MindWeavers'
 Press Release.May 2003 Preliminary trial results show dramatic
 improvements in measures of reading abilitiesFebruary 2003 Identify
 & recruit mainstream school for field trialsNovember 2002 MW
 engage with education sector to design mainstream school field
 trial program for 8-9 year-old children of normal abilities.
Using
 industry recognised performance measures of receptive language
 - the NFER Nelson 'Phonics Assessment Battery' (PhAB) test.August
 2002 Flagship Speech and Language Therapists trials show age
 equivalent improvement of 1.8 years in word listening ability.
 
In a smaller trial in Special Schools, an age improvement of
 1.2 years was found. These improvements are dramatic, and compare
 more than favourably with other commercial trials of language
 training software designed for perceptual learning. They prove
 the effectiveness of Phonomena Training in building listening
 skills that are essential for normal language.May 2002 Field
 trials of Phonomena start. 
Trial groups are: Speech Language
 Therapists, Special Schools, Mainstream Schools, English as
 a Second Language Schools, and Parents.December 2001 MindWeavers
 recruit a panel of Speech & Language therapists. 
To assist
 with a major field trial of a newly developed computer game
 for children with language difficulties.November 2001 International
 meeting of the Society for Neuroscience.
Attended by many of
 the top neuroscientists from across the world, showed the positive
 influence of auditory training on brain activity. A number of
 presentations highlighted the amazing ability of the brain to
 adapt to changed circumstances and to respond to the demands
 of a task, even in the elderly. These results strongly endorse
 the MindWeavers approach of using intensive training near the
 'edge of competence'. 

<p>November 2001 MindWeavers develop new prototype computer game
 'Phonomena'.
Incorporating adaptive phoneme discrimination software,
 Phonomena is targeted at 7 - 12 year old children with language
 difficulties although it has been shown to be effective in older
 age groups as well. The game has the highly motivating look
 and feel of a modern, mainstream computer video game.October
 2001 MindWeavers complete extensive market research programme.
Across
 several sectors, including the speech & language profession
 and UK special needs education. Conclusions from this research
 will be used to direct the next phase of product development.July

 the market and to provide focus to MindWeavers product research
 and development. June 2001 MindWeavers partner with Rebellion
 Developments 
MindWeavers have formed a partnership with Rebellion
 Developments, a leading computer games developer, to design
 and develop a new language skills improvement game. The new
 game will be aimed at 7 to 12 year old children with language
 development problems and will offer, for the first time in an
 educational game of this type, the look and feel of a mainstream
 computer game. May 2001 MindWeavers launch major test programme
 
MindWeavers have launched an extensive programme of testing
 to research the effect of its phoneme discrimination game (Fisher
 Cat Olympics) on children of mixed abilities. Researchers will
