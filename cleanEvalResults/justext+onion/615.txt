<p>Corporate Governance looks at the institutional and policy framework
 for corporations - from their very beginnings, in entrepreneurship,
 through their governance structures, company law, privatisation,
 to market exit and insolvency. The integrity of corporations,
 financial institutions and markets is particularly central to
 the health of our economies and their stability. The OECD Steering
 Group on Corporate Governance co-ordinates and guides the Organisation's
 work on corporate governance.

<p>Companies can boost their stock market valuations and lower their
 cost of capital through improved reporting of intellectual assets
 and value creation strategies that overcome the limits of accounting
 standards, according to a report by the OECD. While there is
 an important role for governments and standard setters in underpinning
 such improvements, the OECD cautions against rigid standards
 in this complex and evolving area.

<p> The OECD has now taken an important step to facilitate the use
 of the OECD Principles of Corporate Governance . Following widespread
 demand, it has released a Methodology for Assessing Implementation
 of the OECD Principles. The Methodology can be used by independent
 assessors and for self-assessments by, inter alia, national
 authorities. It will also be used by the World Bank under its
 Review of Standards and Codes (ROSC) programme.

 implementation of good corporate governance.

<p> Corporate governance is improving in Turkey but some key issues,
 including the potential for unfair treatment of minority shareholders,

<p>Adhering governments are committed to promoting the Guidelines
 and to making them influential among companies operating in
 or from their territories.  This report describes what governments

 of  their implementation over the June 2005-June 2006 period

 non-listed companies.

 Roundtable on Corporate Governance sets out consensus objectives
 and recommendations for banks, regulators and policy-makers
 to strengthen corporate governance of banks in the region.

<p> Rapidly rising attention to the quality of governance in developing
 countries is driving explosive growth in the use of governance
 “indicators” by international investors, donors of official
 development assistance, development analysts and academics.

<p>This seminar brought together banking regulators and members
 of the Task Force of the Asian Roundtable on Corporate Governance
 to discuss and advance on recommendations for better governance
 of banks in the region.  The Financial Stability Institute of
 the Bank for International Settlements co-organised the meeting
 with the OECD.

<p> Multinational enterprises investing in countries characterised
 by weak or non-existent government need to take special care
 in handling a range of risks and ethical dilemmas not usually
 encountered in countries with stronger governance arrangements.
 A new Risk Awareness Tool for Multinational Enterprises in Weak
 Governance Zones from the OECD is designed to help them.
