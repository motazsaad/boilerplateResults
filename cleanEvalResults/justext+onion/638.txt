<h>Create professional interactive multimedia with Director MX

<p>Long before Flash and Dream­­weaver, Director was Macromedia’s
 premiere application for multimedia, providing extensive tools
 for designing animation and interactive programs that could
 be distributed on CD-ROM and, later, across the Web. 

<p>The introduction — and roaring success — of Flash has resulted
 in something of a decline for Director. As Macromedia moved
 towards a standard interface across its MX suite (incorporating
 Flash, Dreamweaver, Freehand and ColdFusion), for a time it
 appeared that Director was going to be left behind, but the
 latest version has been integrated into the rest of Macromedia’s
 range. 

<p>Unless you use OS X for the Mac, this release will probably seem
 much less substantial than version 8.5, which introduced a widely
 adopted 3D engine, although people who regularly use Macromedia
 products will welcome its improvements to the workspace. 

<p>Leaving interface changes aside, perhaps the biggest differences
 in the latest release concentrates on integration with Flash.
 At a first glance, this brings you up against Director’s main
 problem — interactivity — particularly across the Web. Flash
 is ubiquitous, offers small file sizes for downloads and, since
 the improvements to ActionScript in version 5.0, has moved towards
 becoming a usable tool for application development rather than
 just animation — all at a fraction of the cost of Director.
 

<p>Flash is far from perfect, however. The MX release included tools
 for video, but they are still inferior to those for Director,
 as is support for bitmap as opposed to vector images. In addition,
 Macromedia appears to be considering Director as a support for
 back-end control of advanced features in Flash, providing features
 such as copies of Flash Communications Server and Flash Remoting
 MX that are useful for video conferencing, and live control
 of Flash movies via ColdFusion or Microsoft’s .NET server. 

<p>Beyond Flash, however, your reasons for upgrade will boil down
 to two things: do you need to provide multimedia applications
 on disc for the new Macintosh operating system as well as Windows,
 and how important are the (considerable) improvements to Director’s
 interface to bring it in line with other MX programs? If you
 are using version 8.5 and are not particularly interested in
 using Director with Flash, or in producing applications for
 Mac, the changes introduced in the last release will probably
 be sufficient for your requirements. 

<p>That said, changes to the interface should not be dismissed if
 you do a great deal of work with this program (see here for
 a screenshot). Anyone who uses Director MX is unlikely to wish
 to return to an earlier release, and Macromedia’s general work
 on interface design looks set to pay real dividends for multimedia
 professionals. These are also precisely the sort of people who
 are likely to use both Director and Flash for different applications,
 so integration between the two (as well as the rest of the MX
 range) will be greatly appreciated. 

<p>Director still remains the best of breed for producing interactive
 multimedia for distribution on disc (DVD and CD) as well as
 online, with a price to match. However, the very success of
 Flash means that anyone seeking to enter into multimedia development
 will consider the cheaper program first. 

<p>In brief: Macromedia Director MX
 If you need 3D or expect a
 lot of video and image work on disc, choose Director — but for
 everything else, Flash is generally the better option.
