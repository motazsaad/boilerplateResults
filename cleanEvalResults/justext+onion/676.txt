<h>Official suggests euthanizing horses

<h>Unadoptable animals should be killed to control the wild horse
 population, a federal agency chief says.

<p> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; RENO -- The national director
 of the Bureau of Land Management said Monday euthanasia may
 be an effective way to rid the West of unadoptable wild horses.
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "I'm not about to take horses
 off the range and put them in corrals and pay $3 a day to take
 care of them," BLM Director Pat Shea said. 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 The BLM feeds 5,000 wild horses in adoption holding facilities
 in the West, including 2,000 in Palomino Valley, north of Reno.
 An additional 1,500 unadoptable horses -- including more than
 500 taken last year off the Nellis Air Force Base range -- graze
 at a sanctuary north of Oklahoma City. 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 But some of the captured animals are toothless and starving
 slowly to death because they cannot eat enough to survive, said
 Tom Pogacnik, chief of the national Wild Horse and Burro Adoption
 Program. He also said some horses cannot be adopted because
 of their temperament and bad looks. 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 Shea partly blamed the surplus of horses on a lack of money
 to get them adopted. His agency received $17 million from Congress
 in its current budget for the wild horse adoption program. It
 had sought $19.5 million. 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "If
 Congress is not going to give us money to adopt them, then we
 have to find alternative means," he said. 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 Under a 1971 federal law, wild horses and burros are considered
 living symbols of Western heritage and are protected. But the
 law also allows the BLM to dispose of sick, lame or old animals.
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Shea gave his views during a
 break at the first meeting of the reorganized National Wild
 Horse and Burro Advisory Committee. Members are spending three
 days this week in Nevada, including today when they will watch
 a horse roundup near Lovelock. 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 If the advisory committee recommended euthanasia as an option,
 then Shea said he would take the message to Congress, which
 would have to change the law. 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 "I oppose wholesale slaughter," Shea said. But "the image of
 horses without teeth gradually starving to death isn't in anybody's
 interest." 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Pogacnik said horse
 adoptions dropped this past year partly because of reports that
 many horses carry diseases and an Associated Press investigation.
 The news agency reported that thousands of wild horses ended
 up in slaughterhouses because BLM was not properly monitoring
 the program. 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Citizens can adopt
 up to four wild horses for $125 each. After a year, they are
 given title to the animals. 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 About 43,000 wild horses are found in the West. More than half
 live in Nevada. 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Shea, however,
 questions the accuracy of horse census surveys and said the
 number of horses may be much higher. 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 Pogacnik told the advisory committee his agency has determined
 27,000 horses would be the appropriate management level. 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 Wild horses are rounded up and taken off public lands because
 surveys have shown they have overgrazed the range in some areas.
 The BLM conducts emergency roundups at places such as Nellis
 because animals there suffered through periods of extended drought.
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Wild horses also compete with
 livestock for forage, and the BLM strives to balance the interests
 of the wild horses with the interest of livestock owners. 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 The idea that unadoptable horses should be euthanized was embraced
 quickly by Fred Burke, a rancher and advisory board member from
 Wickenburg, Ariz. 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "We need to
 do the best for the animals," Burke said. "We need to put them
 down, preferably at a rendering plant where the BLM can receive
 some money." 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Burke was a member
 of the last wild horse and burro advisory board that in 1992
 recommended euthanasia as an option for disposal of unadoptable
 horses The recommendation was not adopted. 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 Before taking a step toward euthanasia, Shea said, the BLM needs
 to market better its adoption program and to evaluate birth
 control methods for the wild horses. 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 Board member Naomi Tyler, a wild horse owner from Boise, Idaho,
 called wild horses "legends" that should be kept alive. Tyler
 said she adopted a wild horse that no one one else wanted. The
 horse in 1990 became the national endurance champion. 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 She also said the demand for wild horses in Idaho is high, but
 her state does not accept wild horses rounded up in other states.
 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; "The demand is there," Tyler
 said. "Let's not treat these animals as rodents."
