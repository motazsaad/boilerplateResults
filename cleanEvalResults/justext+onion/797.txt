<p>Red state or blue, north or south, voters around the country
 found at least one thing they could agree on yesterday as proposals
 banning same-sex marriage were winning in all 11 states where
 the issue appeared on the ballot. 

<p>Tallies from Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi,
 Montana, Ohio, Oklahoma, North Dakota and Utah showed constitutional
 amendments restricting marriage to a man and woman would pass
 by substantial margins. A similar measure in Oregon enjoyed
 a solid lead with nearly three-quarters of the votes counted.

<p> Gary Bauer, director of the conservative group American Values,
 said the results on same-sex marriage proposals "tell us that
 the American people know exactly where they stand on this question,
 and it doesn't matter whether it's a Bush state or a Kerry state."
 

<p>But social conservatives were on the losing end of the vote in
 California, where voters agreed to create a $3 billion fund
 to finance research on embryonic stem cells, circumventing federal
 limits imposed by President Bush.

<p>Voters in three other states were headed toward approving new
 funds dedicated to health care programs, in each case by imposing
 hefty tax increases on tobacco. Montanans agreed to raise the
 tax on a pack of cigarettes by $1; an increase of 64 cents per
 pack was leading in Colorado, and Oklahoma voters approved a
 55-cent tax hike. 

<p>In a result that could spark anti-immigration proposals in other
 states, Arizona voters appeared to be backing a measure that
 would require public officials to turn in illegal immigrants
 who seek public services, including police or fire calls. Supporters
 of the proposal said they want to see the idea carried to other
 states.

<p>In Colorado, voters rejected a plan that would have divided the
 state's nine electoral votes in proportion to the popular vote
 in presidential elections. Supporters had called the move a
 step toward eliminating the electoral college nationally; opponents
 argued that dividing the state's vote would prompt presidential
 candidates to ignore Colorado altogether. Colorado Republicans,
 expecting Bush to carry the state, led the opposition to the
 proposal.

<p>Montana voters approved the use of marijuana there for medical
 reasons, even though Bush had dispatched his drug czar to campaign
 against the measure. But a measure to further loosen marijuana
 controls in Oregon was losing, and Alaskans appeared to defeat
 a proposal that would have decriminalized marijuana possession.
 

<p>Floridians approved a cap on damage awards in medical malpractice
 lawsuits. A similar proposal was leading in Nevada, but the
 vote on malpractice damage caps was extremely close in Oregon
 and Wyoming. 

<p>Florida voters also approved a measure that will allow the legislature
 to require parental notice before an abortion can be performed
 on girls younger than 18. Courts previously voided parental-notice
 laws, but the ballot measure passed yesterday changes the state
 constitution and would allow the legislature to approve the
 law. 

<p>Floridians approved a measure to raise the minimum wage to $6.15,
 a dollar above the federal minimum wage. Nevadans were also
 voting on a minimum-wage increase.

<p>Oklahomans agreed to create a state lottery, leaving nine states
 that do not use this form of gambling to raise revenue. But
 gambling proposals struck out elsewhere. Californians appeared
 to reject proposals to allow more slot machines and casinos,
 Michigan voters tightened requirements to open casinos there,
 and Nebraskans resoundingly rejected an initiative that would
 have permitted Las Vegas-style casinos on the plains. 

<p>A proposal before California voters to ease the three-strikes
 law that mandates a lengthy prison term for a third felony conviction
 was closely contested with about half the voted counted.

<p>The election offered more than 160 ballot issues to voters in
 34 states yesterday. That was a decline from the 2002 election,
 when ballots in 40 states listed 202 initiatives and referenda.
 The decrease reflected, in part, efforts by several state legislatures
 to make it more difficult for voters to qualify initiative proposals
 for the ballot.
