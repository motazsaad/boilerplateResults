<h>Advance the Foundations of A Subject

<h>   

<p>Our knowledge of the logical and natural foundations of many
 field is slight, or at least dubious or imperfect. Certainly
 subjects differ drastically in the relative strength of their
 foundations, or in the apparent fundamentality of their concepts,
 methods, principles, theories, achievements, research, language,
 logic, etc. 

<p>Ideonomy can compare the foundations of different disciplines
 to discover analogies, differences, commonalities, interdependences,
 contradictions, redundancies, interpenetrations, convergences,
 common goals and needs, unities, etc. It can use these to suggest
 omissions, errors, common opportunities for research or discovery,
 ways to redescribe the foundations of one subject in terms of
 the foundations of another, reciprocal problems and fallacies,
 equivalent principles and entities, joint ignorance, new tests
 and experiments, higher standards, useful priorities, strategies
 of theory, etc. 

<p>It can suggest ways in which to combine or transform certain
 concepts or dimensions so as to generate or define 'all' possible
 or important concepts or things, or the spaces and manifolds
 thereof. Contained or implicit within such sets, spaces, and
 manifolds may be concepts or other things that can supplement
 or deepen the foundations of the subject to which they pertain.
 

<p>Moreover, examining or merely experiencing such enlarged perspectives
 upon what is possible may lead to the realization that what
 has been taken to be fundamental within a subject is not really
 fundamental; or at least, that the foundations--or supposed
 foundations--of the subject are not as free of assumptions,
 problems, inelegant features, superfluous elements, discrepancies,
 idiosyncratic aspects, etc as has been thought. 

<p>Since ideonomy seeks to discover all of those natural concepts,
 dimensions, representations, entities, phenomena, laws, principles,
 relationships, etc that are supremely universal, fundamental,
 important, essential, minimal, logical, generative, necessary,
 transcendental, and pantological, it is in a privileged position
 to advance the foundations of arbitrary fields. 

<p>It is in fact a principal goal of ideonomy to make all sciences
 more scientific, and among the best ways of doing this are by
 rectifying, enlarging, and extending the foundations of these
 subjects. 

<p>There is a hint that ideonomy may be on the verge of discovering
 some unsuspected category of being that is more fundamental
 than either ideas or things, or that transcends what is meant
 by both the "mental" and "physical'' aspects of reality. 

<p>By placing all of the things and phenomena in a subject upon
 basic scales--as of duration, time, Population, importance,
 complexity, or entropy--ideonomy can call the mind's attention
 to what is only naturally the most and least fundamental in
 a subject, to the way in which things derive their greater or
 lesser fundamentality from one another, to the direction in
 which that which is truly or most fundamental is apt to be found,
 or to the properties that fundamentals or foundations are likely
 to or must have. 

<p>Knowledge or theory of the foundations of many subjects is impaired
 by a conscious or unconscious failure to identify, define, characterize,
 or emphasize the most fundamental, central, or final topic,
 concept, phenomenon, substance, law, entity, goal, or the like
 of the subject (or the set of such things). Then again, the
 supreme topic or whatever may have some terrible unsolved problem
 or difficulty associated with it. 

<p>Thus the supreme concern of physics is no longer clear, the arch
 concern of sociology is in dispute, the goal of psychology is
 in flux, the essential nature or defining properties of life
 are unknown to the science of life (or to biology), and even
 the basic object of study of mathematics (it cannot be number,
 though the nature of number is an enigma in any case), cosmology
 (what is the described or effable 'universe' itself a part of?),
 and ideonomy (ideas, as hinted above, may not be sufficiently
 fundamental) is mysterious. 

<p>Ideonomy can be used to define concepts in new and ever more
 fundamental ways, and it has already been used to define life,
 or to reduce it to a set of ninety-two fundamental properties.
 The set of 8,464 possible dyadic combinations of the primary
 properties have demonstrated such extraordinary interest that
 they promise to revolutionize theoretical biology, something
 which at once illustrates the importance of clarifying fundamentals
 and suggests that the traits that were used to define the phenomenon
 of "life" were indeed fundamental. 

<p>On the other hand, the same bit of ideonomic research also highlighted
 the problems that plague all efforts to resolve fundamentals
 or to get at the genuine foundations of a subject; for it was
 found that the same set of ninety-two basic properties of "life"
 have either analogs or exact equivalents in the supposedly inanimate
 phenomena of subjects other than biology. Thus forms or analogs
 of procreation, natural selection, and evolution either may
 or do exist in fields such as physical chemistry, geology, psychology,
 and cosmology. The implication may variously be that life is
 not limited or peculiar to biology, that life must be otherwise
 defined or defined via other properties, that the essential
 phenomena of biology should include more than organisms, or
 that biology should be recast into a superscience incorporating
 many other sciences or that--like mathematics--applies to all
 science. 

<p>An old way of advancing the foundations of a subject is by improving,
 formalizing, or axiomatizing its logic; and a new or just now
 emerging way, by giving the subject cognitive form, which means
 the form of thought itself. Ideonomy can help with both of these
 approaches, particularly in conjunction with computer software
 and hardware. 

<p>Erect Frameworks For Thought

<p>To think about anything one needs some manner of conceptual framework,
 a schema upon which to hang ideas or in which to develop, interweave,
 and experiment upon different concepts. 

<p>Ideonomy, in effect, can enable such conceptual schemes, structures,
 and systems to be mass produced; it can widen their scope, diversify
 them, enhance their power, increase their connectivity or interrelatedness,
 greaten their mobility within and between fields, enlarge their
 rationality or make their logic more explicit, give the individual
 the power to freely manipulate them, etc. 

<p>The concept of mental frameworks is so important to ideonomy
 that it needs to be expanded upon. By it we mean an open-ended
 set of : schemes, structures, systems, and 'machines' of : ideas,
 relations, principles, presuppositions, facts, arguments, thoughts,
 beliefs, values, purposes, perspectives, methods, strategies,
 gestalts, analyses, attitudes, percepts, images, definitions,
 explanations, dimensions, symbols, criteria, representations,
 models, heuristics, postulates, generalizations, theories, procedures,
 wisdoms, stories, memories, analogies, rules, mental associations,
 etc : serving or for furthering thought.

<p>Such mental schematizations of: experience, the environment,
 reality, behavior, human existence, or possibility : can be
 : conscious or unconscious : formal or informal : specific,
 general, or universal ad hoc or perpetual (evolutionary) : deductive
 or inductive : empirical or theoretical : categorical or experimental
 : developing or inert : etc. 

<p>The diverse values and uses of cognitive frameworks include:
 mental simplification; clustering, grouping, and classifying
 of ideas and facts; explication and coordination of different
 purposes and goals; structuring of memories in hierarchies,
 series, networks, trees, vergences, rings or cycles, foliations,
 meta-stories, etc-that are especially dynamic, powerful, natural,
 efficient, dense, optimal, etc; recursive, self-developing,
 nucleative, and self-correcting properties or effects; the multidimensional
 mental parallax given by a multitude-of such frameworks; provision
 of a stable apparatus for developing and maintaining mental
 skills; standardization within the mind (&agrave; la worldwide
 industrial and scientific standardization); provision of bases
 for tests, evaluations, investigations, and experiments; limitation
 of thought to what is necessary and obviation of trivial and
 repetitive thought and creativity; bases for communication among
 different minds and for comparisons of their contents; enabling
 of more precise and rigorous thought; codification of though!
 acceleration of thought; enabling of overviews of experience,
 the world, one's conduct, and the mind; greater mental flexibility
 and self-control; readier learning; quick or more powerful structuring
 of materials, subjects, problems, or situations; automation
 of mental habits and of ideation; heightened clarity of mind;
 etc. 

<p>Frameworks for thought can enable a topic to be taught, mastered,
 or treated more deeply or completely. They can provide clues
 for probing the nature of a thing. They can enable more imaginative
 or less prejudiced thought. They can help one to prepare for
 a more serious intellectual endeavor. They can help one relate
 one perspective to another, or permit one to grasp a new thing
 by analogy to an old or familiar thing. 

<p>Enumerate the Functions of A Thing

<p>Things may, and usually do, have far more numerous and diverse
 functions, roles, and importances than people realize or would
 even imagine. If this is true, it has great significance:

<p>Features of our world may be carelessly eliminated or altered
 by the ignorant march of progress or change; All existing things
 may have a web of ecological relationships that merit study
 and respect; Things may all be beneficiaries of many more things
 than has been thought; There may be an unsuspectedly great number
 of ways to change and improve the world or its things; etc.
 

<p>Among the possible generic functions of things are: Mediation;
 Prevention; Protection; Connection; Transportation; Communication;
 Symbolization; Testing; Facilitation; Amplification; Imitation
 or substitution; Extension; Generalization; Specialization;
 Correction; Improvement; Balancing; Sublimation or domestication;
 Counteraction; Elimination; Supplementation; Complementation;
 Exploitation; Coping; Hiding or deception; Showing; Production;
 Concentration or confinement; Combination or integration; Separation,
 division, or liberation; Ordering; Maintenance or supply; Storage,
 holding, preservation, or conservation; Preparation; Initiation;
 Control or management; Adjustment or modulation; Transcendence,
 circumvention, or obviation; Orientation; Reduction or economization
 (enhancement of efficiency); Transformation; Etc. 

<p>Ideonomy can help answer such questions about functions as:

<p>How do functions overlap? 

<p>What functions are competitive? What functions are cooperative,
 complementary, or synergistic? 

<p>What functions are illusory, misleading, or ambiguous? 

<p>What are all of the degrees of functions of things? What are
 the maximal, minimal, and optimal functions of things? What
 are all of the intermediate functions of things? 

<p>What functions are absolute or relative? What makes them absolute
 or relative? What are all of the ways in which they are absolute
 and relative? What are all of the absolute and relative functions
 of a thing? 

<p>What functions conflict with, contradict, or negate what other
 functions? 

<p>How do things acquire--and lose--their functions? How do or could
 functions originate, develop, evolve, diminish, or disappear?
 

<p>How do different functions compare? What are all of the ways
 of comparing all functions? What functions are identical, equivalent,
 analogous, or related to what other functions? What functions
 differ or diverge from, or are opposite to, what other functions?
 What are all of the degrees, bases, circumstances, and implications
 of these things? 

<p>What are not the functions of things, and what functions do not
 exist or are impossible? 

<p>What are all of the generic and specific : properties, dimensions,
 elements, mechanisms, effects, signs, manifestations, criteria,
 etc of all generic and specific functions? 
What functions are
 arbitrary or necessary? What functions are artificial or natural?
 What are the degrees and causes of these things? 

<p>How can the: prediction, classification, recognition, examination,
 evaluation, explanation, creation, development, application
 or use, intercorrelation, synthesis, differentiation, description,
 definition, modification, control or government, etc : of the
 functions of arbitrary things be mechanized and automated in
 the future, when the needed technology and methodology emerges7
 

<p>How can different functions, and different species and genera
 of functions, be combined to synthesize novel, desirable, or
 arbitrary functions--or systems of functions--or to enlarge,
 transform, or relocate old functions? 

<p>What functions of familiar or known things have been neglected,
 forgotten about, or overlooked? What are the idiosyncrasies
 of the ways in which people in general, or certain groups of
 people, classify, perceive, rank, or utilize the classes of
 functions of classes of things? What is good, bad, or simply
 significant about these idiosyncrasies? 

<p>What are the characteristic and comparative ratios of our ignorance
 about to our knowledge about different (key or comprehensive)
 functions of different (key or comprehensive) things in different
 (key or comprehensive) situations? 

<p>What are all possible or important categories of ignorance and
 knowledge about functions? What are the actual extent, qualities,
 and forms of our ignorance, knowledge, and skills within each
 of these vergent categories? What are the total-known or hypothesizable--costs,
 values, consequences, and implications thereof? 

<p>In what meta-structures: series, networks, hierarchies, trees,
 lattices, rings, circuitries, vergences, knots, line-clumps,
 'crystals' (e.g. of intersecting hyperdimensional planes or
 curved surfaces), plexures, 'soils', matrixes, clusters, 'blobs',
 conoids, helicoids, aegagropilas or Peano curves, 'onions',
 fractals, chaoses, paths, 'catastrophes', tessellations or 'jigsaw
 puzzles', topological monsters, etc : do or could functions
 : exist, originate, operate, interact, develop, metamorphose,
 vanish, combine, coalesce, reproduce, cooriginate, coevolve,
 invert, exhibit singularities, etc? 

<p>How do such meta-structures themselves: behave, associate, interact,
 evolve, originate, function, etc? 

<p>How could or must the meta-structures of functions be used to
 describe, explain, discover, manipulate, create, alter, etc
 : particular or arbitrary functions? 

<p>What are all the particular or recurrent : goods, bads, defects,
 imperfections, limitations, etc.: of all functions of all things?
 

<p>What are all known or possible functions of a single, particular
 or random, thing--and how are they structured inter se? 

<p>Conversely, what are all of the actual or possible things that
 have or could have a single, random or specific, function? What
 do they have or not have in common, that explains or relates
 to their shared function--or that does not do so? 

<p>What are all of the self-functions of things? 

<p>What set of questions should be asked when treating functions?
 How should they be ranked in relative importance? In what order
 should they be asked-or set of orders, depending on particular
 circumstances? What explains their diverse importance? Which
 of these questions are and are not currently asked; or how efficient
 is the asking and answering of these questions? What decision-tree
 should govern the use of these questions, and what are its proper
 and possible anastomoses? What are the ways in which some of
 the questions can and should be iterated? 

<p>As results piled up worldwide from the habitual, ubiquitous,
 and standardized use of such an encyclopedic, all-purpose, or
 universal questionary, how could they be systematically and
 efficiently compiled, collated, colligated, promulgated, and
 exploited? 

<p>Illustrative examples of functions include the function or functions
 of: Telephones in creating commercial nexuses; Human skin microflora
 in (hypothetically) preempting sites upon which pathogens can
 establish themselves and from which the pathogens can invade
 the macrosymbiontic body; Ball bearings in minimizing frictional
 contacts of overpassing surfaces; Lightning in maintaining biogeochemical
 cycles and (by deflagrating forests and prairies) ecological
 successions; Clowns in lighting up the hearts of children; Taverns
 in sublimating life's horrors; Axons of neurons in shuttling
 and multiplying data in the brain; Grammar in inducing neural
 impulses, data, or patterns to organize themselves into vergent
 hierarchies in the brain; Expletives in dissipating, condensing,
 or civilizing excessive emotions; Sidewalks in keeping pedestrians
 and children off streets-and cars off the former; Marriage in
 stabilizing, reproducing, and subdividing society; Rugs in simulating
 grass, creating thermal barriers (conserving heat or coolness),
 and stopping sound (perfectirig-privacy); Buildings' foundations
 in stabilizing and economizing frames; Spiders' webs in trapping
 flying, hopping, and climbing insects who do not notice them
 or who mistake them for stems, giving their creators' midair
 nests inaccessible by lumbrous predators, and telegraphically
 or resonantly forewarning their seismoceptive occupants of the
 approach of more funambulatory enemies; Cloud cover in regulating
 terrestrial insolation and Earth's albedo--and hence in stabilizing
 climate to the advantage, or conceivably in the Gaian service,
 of the bios; Money in mediating, stabilizing, equalizing, universalizing,
 codifying, recording, rationalizing, virtualizing, coordinating,
 lubricating, temporally broadening, quantizing, algebraizing
 (sensu making more perfectly distributive, associative, transitive,
 commutative, etc), institutionalizing, formalizing, unifying,
 mechanizing, 'vocalizing', 'intellectualizing', etc the exchange
 of goods and services; Cosmetics in role-playing, seduction,
 intrasexual competition, feminization, and beautification of
 the social landscape; Maps in collation, abstraction, and communication
 of geographic data; Roots in recovering rainwater from the sponge-like
 soil; Stars in manufacturing larger atoms and animating planets
 (or at least one planet); Windows in half-admitting the outdoors
 into buildings; Rulers, in quantizing the dimensions of objects;
 Dolls in preparing children for adult life, as surrogate parents,
 and as mirrors enabling kids to look upon themselves or to explore
 the worlds of intersubjectivity; Glue as an ersatz nail (at
 once cheap, nondestructive, hammer-less, all-size, always-singular,
 etc); Genes in remembering, immortalizing, transmuting, and
 'generalizing' organisms; Etc.

<p>Many things can be done to functions; they can be: Enlarged or
 diminished; Multiplied and diversified-or the reverse; Created
 or or ended; Broadened or narrowed; Sophisticated or simplified;
 Connected or disconnected; Integrated or unified; Differentiated
 within or from other functions; Obviated; Temporarily suspended;
 Redirected or realigned; Molded or modified; Replaced by others;
 Relocated or rearranged with respect to other functions; Extended
 to include other things; Combined; Permuted; Transelemented;
 Redefined; Facilitated; Perpetuated; Perfected; Fixed (frozen);
 Slowed or quickened; Elevated or reduced in importance -or made
 central or peripheral; Modulated; Etc. 

<p>Foster Wisdom About the Future

<p>There are many ways in which one could be wise or wiser about
 the future; e.g. one could simply attend to it more closely,
 or appreciate better the fleeting nature of the present or of
 things as they now are; one could systematically examine the
 range of future possibilities; one could visualize the various
 alternative courses the world might takein the future, and the
 things apt to determine which particular set of courses the
 world will actually follow; one could identify the world's needs
 in advancing into the future, and endeavor to provide for those
 needs and wants; one could help to educate all present and future
 humanity to deal with the future; one could attempt to influence
 the actual course the world will take tomorrow, or to push it
 toward what would be good and away from what would be evil or
 inferior; one could labor to produce general methods for foreseeing
 or altering the future; etc. 

<p>Of course the future being referred to need not be that of the
 world as a whole or represented by the future in its entirety,
 but on the contrary might be arbitrarily modest: one's own future
 lifetime, perhaps, or tomorrow's events or the events of the
 next minute, or the momentary or instantaneous outcome of a
 scientific experiment that someone is performing or whose performance
 is simply being contemplated. 

<p>Becoming wiser about the future might mean nothing more than
 divesting oneself of prejudicial ideas, attitudes, beliefs,
 or world views, becoming friendlier--or more hostile--to innovation,
 reducing the irrational inertia of institutions, or paying more
 attention to the patterns and lessons of history that might
 be analogous or relevant to the future. 

<p>Among the fallacies that diminish wisdom about the future, and
 that ideonomy could help to combat, are that: the future will
 simply repeat the past; the course of the future is predetermined
 and inalterable; the world of the present represents the best
 of all possible worlds; human knowledge and wisdom are nearly
 complete and perfect--and our ignorance small and unimportant;
 the future is too complex or esoteric for us to anticipate its
 character or possibilities--and past failures and inability
 to correctly foresee the future were unavoidable, and should
 be looked upon as a warning that all prophecy is folly; etc.
 

<p>Ideonomy could be used to: devise new, or suggest all possible,
 methods for studying future possibilities; survey, describe,
 compare, evaluate, criticize, correct, extend, integrate, and
 transcend all past and present prophetic methods, endeavors,
 and results; identify the totality of things that can or should
 have their future possibilities considered; predict the future
 interrelationships and interactions of these things; indicate
 the future's most fundamental dimensions, structure, forces,
 elements, patterns, laws, etc; formulate principles for treating
 the future; develop novel means for representing and dramatizing
 the future's possibilities (e.g. diagrams, organons, computer
 software and simulations new types of books, special language
 and idea spaces, artificial intelligence programs, etc); suggest
 all possible causes, effects, and conditions of future possibilities;
 rank the relative and absolute probability and importance of
 all future possibilities; indicate the different roles and functions
 that things are apt to have in the future; and so forth. 

<p>Some of the specific questions and other issues that ideonomy
 could help to address are: What should be maximized and minimized
 in the future? What new rights may become political issues in
 the future? What human freedoms must ultimately be restrained
 for the good of all? What present concerns of government will
 be retired and what new concerns will take their place? What
 means are there for maximizing the future diversity and complexity
 of civilization? What were the laws of history, insofar as they
 apply to the future as well? How ambiguous is the future or
 are its possibilities? What meta-structures are applicable to
 the study of the future or will actually describe its possibilities:
 incl. chains, series, trees, networks, hierarchies, vergences,
 etc? What elements of the present will disappear or endure in
 the future? What new discoveries, inventions, creations, and
 other innovations are possible, probable, or certain in the
 future? What developments can continue ad infinitum and which
 must have limits? In what ways is the future apt to surprise
 us? What are all the future possibilities of a single, random
 or particular, thing? What future possibilities would be synergistic
 or antagonistic? In what order must different things happen?
 

<p>Illustrative examples of specific future possibilities are: Elimination
 of the need for sleep; Chinese democratic revolution; Life discovered
 elsewhere in the cosmos; Legalization of prostitution; Replacement
 of stores by teleshopping and robotized delivery of goods to
 homes; Evolution of a single panhuman language; Reduction of
 physics to 'pure' logic; New age of dirigibles; Exploration
 of a single cave 'pushed' to 100,000 kilometers (using miniature
 humanoid teleoperators); Mechanical pets and computer- simulated
 plants more popular than biological organisms; Family car replaced
 by a flying equivalent; irrefutable scientific proof of the
 existence of 'God'; Temporal metric system adopted; War fought
 using beams of elementary particles so exotic that they have
 not yet been imagined; Time's apparently unique and irreversible
 flow shown to be a physical illusion; Mining of Earth's mantle;
 Every organism on Earth transformed into a different species;
 New human sexes added to the traditional two; Complete obsolescence
 of the family; Lamps made to last centuries; immortality made
 compulsory; Ethics remade into an exact science; Deliberate
 suicide of the human race, subjectively rendered irrelevant
 by its own transhuman mechanical creations; Ideonomy taught
 at all grade levels in all schools; War everywhere ended by
 the introduction of "peace pills" (irenic psychopharmaceuticals);
 Etc. 

<p>Generalize Notions

<p>One can use ideonomy to help to generalize or even universalize
 any and all notions and things. 

<p>Over time things often prove to be insufficiently generalized.
 That is, the essential idea or set of ideas associated with
 them turn out to have greater meaning, scope, or application
 than what is initially --or perhaps than is ever at any finite
 moment--thought to be the case. 

<p>Actually it is probably true that in some sense the generality
 of all concepts, and all concepts of things, must always be
 at once inadequate and excessive. 

<p>But according to an ideonomic principle it is of the utmost importance
 that the generality of all concepts constantly be enlarged over
 time, or advanced toward infinity. Naturally in the course of
 such progressive generalization the concepts will undergo fundamental
 metamorphoses, yet a form of semantic continuity may be apparent
 in retrospect that was prospectively invisible or even meaningless.
 

<p>It could be said that all concepts are inherently infinite in
 meaning, and even that this infinite aspect is close to their
 essence. 

<p>To generalize - according to the dictionary - is to make general
 reduce to general laws : give a general form to; to derive or
 induce (a general conception or principle) from particulars;
 to derive or induce a general conception, principle, or inference
 from; to make general (as by existential or universal qualification)
 : render applicable to a wider class; to give general applicability
 to; to modify or eliminate (nonessential details) for emphasizing
 some particular feature; to portray or emphasize general rather
 than particular features and characteristics of. 

<p>Illustrative examples of generalizations of ideas and things:
 Historically, the generalization of the legal concept of a person
 to include corporations and other organizations, even though
 these contain many human beings; Energy has been generalized
 to include mass; Some quantum physicists would generalize the
 concept of a physical phenomenon to include the apparatus used
 to measure the phenomenon, the observer, or even the observational
 or mensurational act; A few physicists would go even further,
 and define any phenomenon as perforce including the whole universe
 or all of spacetime; Certain modern composers generalize the
 notion of musical scale to include any systematic or recurrent
 arrangement of notes on which a composition is based; The concept
 of intelligence has been generalized to include animals that
 were formerly regarded as mindless; Skeletal and muscular systems
 have been generalized to include the cytoskeleton and other
 purely intracellular systems and structures; Analogous generalization
 of the nervous system to include equivalents in unicellular
 organisms--and perhaps plants--may be imminent; Concepts of
 star and galaxy should perhaps be generalized to include one
 another--since stars (as superstars) may equal or exceed (dwarf)
 galaxies in size; The progressive generalization of the concept
 of number in the history of mathematics to ever more abstract,
 strange ' numerous, and 'less number-like' things (imaginary
 numbers being one of the more famous products of this process);
 Over history the concept of evolution has become ever more generalized--to
 embrace not only biology (life; the phylogeny of species, ontogeny
 of bionts, and life-long biosynthesis of molecules, organelles,
 etc) but geology (Earth and other planets; the evolution of
 continents, mountains, geospheres, etc), astronomy (stars, galaxies
 perhaps, and the universe as a whole), physics (matter, energy,
 space, time, physical laws and constants perhaps, etc), society,
 industry, economies, the mind, ethics, the arts, etc; Mental
 illness has been generalized to include normal mental states
 and individuals (on the belief that the difference is only one
 of degree, perspective, or concern)--and mental normality has
 been generalized to include mental illness (e.g. based on the
 belief that the latter may be rational, coherent, or productive
 when viewed internally, from a different or larger perspective,
 or with an awareness that society is universally illogical and
 insane); Learning might be generalized to include selective
 forgetting, unlearning, and progressive inhibition; The concepts
 of publishing, book, and magazine can be generalized to include
 novel forms and products of electronic publishing; The concept
 of color might be generalized to include the static and dynamic
 meanings of pseudocolors in different or all possible situations--or
 simply to perceptual and cognitive patterns apparent in temporal
 successions and combinations of regular colors; Over the course
 of history the concept or subject of science has broadened unremittingly,
 to the extent that it now includes the study of: art qua aesthetics,
 musicology, philology, etc.; money, wealth, and economic systems
 qua economics; governments and governance qua political science;
 reasoning and intelligence qua logic and cognitive science;
 battle and peace qua military science; techniques and 
engineering
 qua technology; society qua sociology; history qua historiology;
 the psyche qua psychology; ideas qua ideonomy; 
administration
 qua management science; language and languages qua linguistics;
 forms qua morphology; chance qua stochastics; science itself
 qua metascience; farming qua agriculture; etc; Etc. 

<p>Examples of things that may have been inadequately generalized
 or that may be generalized in the future:

<p>Humor: If precursors, rudiments', theriomorphic variants, or
 analogs of laughter or a risibles are eventually found in animals
 other than man, generalization of the concept or phenomenon
 of humor (its origin, functions, mechanisms, types, properties,
 referents, states, logics, degrees, scope, etc) may turn out
 to be desirable or necessary; 

<p>Machine: The concept of a machine may have to be generalized
 so as to include biological phenomena (e.g. genomes, protein
 molecules, micelles, organelles, cells, organs, biochemical
 networks and processes, bodily macro- systems such as the nervous
 and immune systems, organisms, ecosystems, and the hypothetically
 Gaian bios), various phenomena and entities in pure and applied
 mathematics--or even logic, chemical reactions, crystals, diversely
 intelligent computers; models, simulations, and even scientific
 theories; human languages and computer programs; geological
 and meteorological phenomena such as volcanoes and storms, the
 'universe', man's mind or society, pure or real-world ideas,
 physical laws, statistical and quantum phenomena in physics,
 economic systems, political ideologies, ethical systems, and
 symphonies; 

<p>Food: This should include 'nutritive' atmospheric gases; conceivably
 organisms get some genes or genic influences directly from food
 (via "lateral gene flow"); the body is forever 'consuming itself'
 (in strange and little- known senses); even inanimate phenomena
 'eat' or require 'nutrition' from their environment; conceivably
 the seemingly stable and self-existent macroscopic world, with
 its delomorphic baryons and leptons, is in reality being dynamically
 maintained and replenished from below, or by chains, fountains,
 singularities, plexiform or vergent hierarchies, or the like
 ascending from the ultramicroscopic level of zero-point, Bore],
 Dirac- vacuum, Wheeler-prespace, or Bohm-implicate order fluctuations;
 and the mind 'eats' ideas; 

<p>House: This concept should be generalized to include the diverse
 homes (-nests, burrows, cavities, interstices, webs, mounds,
 hollow trees, logs, host exteriors and interiors, atmospheric
 dust and cloud particles, etc) of all organisms; shells, exoskeletons,
 skin, bodies, the skull and blood-brain barrier, etc; cells,
 plasmalemmas, misc. membranes, etc; ecological niches, ecosystems,
 and the bios; as well as the 'houses' of inanimate phenomena:
 atmospheres, planets, the heliosphere, the galactic atmosphere,
 the universe, factories, etc; 

<p>Universe: Generalizing this terribly presumptuous concept might
 be appropriate if there are other universes or quasi-external
 parts of our universe, Everett's Many-Worlds Cosmology is real,
 most of the mass of the universe is invisible and exotic stuff,
 there is an infinite microcosm, Bohm's Implicate Order exists,
 etc; or to take account of Wheeler's Superspace, the omniverse
 (all of spacetime), physicomental "reality", and the Ideocosm.
 

<p>Things, concepts, methods, resources, etc that are ordinarily
 used in only a limited way can be tentatively or permanently
 applied elsewhere, to other things, domains, elements, tasks,
 subjects, etc, or universally; 

<p>Words, concepts, things, loci, structures, operations, functions,
 etc can be added to, combined with, included within, subsumed
 or treated under, identified with, etc something: one or a set
 of : things, concepts, words, functions, subjects, concerns,
 investigations, etc; 

<p>Other forms of a thing, concept, or whatever can be created,
 discovered, postulated, treated, used, etc: one, many, or all;
 

<p>Something can be transformed into something else, of a similar
 or dissimilar nature, or something else can bederived from it;

<p>What are all possible, all nonequivalent, all specialized, and
 all hierarchical generalizations of or regarding a single, random
 or particular, thing? 

<p>How can or should all things, or all sets of types of things,
 be progressively generalized into, with respect to, or on the
 basis of, one another?

<p>What are all human motivations for generalizing and not generalizing
 any and all things in any and all ways in any and all circumstances;
 and what are all of the psychodynamics thereof? What are the
 total ideonomic interests of these things? 

<p>What are the current frontiers of generalization of things by
 mankind? 

<p>Suggest Goals

<p>Many enterprises are launched, conducted, and even consummated
 with almost no attention paid to their possible, actual, or
 appropriate goals. 

<p>Yet this can cause many problems and have many costs, e.g.: Inefficiency;
 Failure to make adequate or correct provision or preparation;
 Inability to notice and rectify a faulty course; Taking of excessive
 or unnecessary risks, perhaps unconsciously; Blindness to opportunities;
 Indecision and inaction in crises; Indirection and aimless wandering;
 Lack of plans and priorities; Inability to optimize the use--and
 mindless wastage--of finite resources; Anarchy; Distractibility;
 Inaction; Anomie and tedium; Lack of motivation; Inconsistencies,
 contradictions, and disharmonies; Impossibility of cooperative
 endeavor; Inability to structure existence; Fragility of an
 enterprise and a tendency for it to degenerate and fragment;
 Inability to discriminate good from bad--or to recognize what
 is best and worst, vital and unimportant, central and peripheral,
 significant and irrelevant, etc; Anonymity to the world at large
 or external confusion and misreaction; Etc. 

<p>Ideonomy can be used to suggest goals that are: new, alternative,
 contrasting, successional or progressive, maximal or optimal,
 safe, certain, transcendent or revolutionary, unconsidered or
 overlooked, realistic, easy, expedient, productive, ultimate
 or supreme, simpler or more complex, indirect, contingent, secondary
 or tertiary, suited to oneself, complementary to situations
 or circumstances, compatible, synergistic, logical, less costly,
 multidimensional or multipurpose, subtle, definable, proportionate
 to one's resources, unorthodox, contra-intuitive, irredundant,
 finite or infinite, equivalent or analogous, specific or general,
 universal, etc. 

<p>Goals are often pursued that are the wrong ones, but they are
 not abandoned because they have never been made explicit. When
 some goal is made explicit it becomes possible to study its
 real meaning and importance and the relationships it has to
 other things that are being done or that might be done. The
 things that are required for the goal to be achieved can be
 investigated, decided upon, and implemented. 

<p>Ideonomy by its nature encourages the comparative study of every
 sort of goal in every sort of field, and profitable knowledge
 can be derived from this of the larger and more efficient ways
 and means of pursuing arbitrary or all goals. Mistakes that
 are apt to be made in selecting and achieving goals can be identified,
 along with ways of avoiding those mistakes or of dealing with
 them when they occur. 

<p>Other characteristic problems that are associated with the pursuit
 of goals include an overdramatization of the importance of a
 single goal, token attention to the goal, a tendency for a goal
 to be misformulated or misinterpreted, failure to appreciate
 that a goal is apt to be more than a simple name or definition
 and may embrace the simple insights that are apt to accrue in
 planning for and advancing toward the goal, the error of relying
 upon a single method or path for achieving the goal, etc. 

<p>Illustrative examples of goals are: Putting the first men on
 the Moon; Target in an enemy country of an intercontinental
 ballistic missile; Downing and eating of a gazelle as the goal
 of a lion that is stalking it; Student's goal of passing an
 exam; Finding a needle in a haystack; Landing someone as one's
 spouse; Solving some great unsolved problem in mathematics,
 as by finding a proof of Fermat's last theorem; Breaking an
 Olympic record in poll vaulting; 'Pineapple's goal' of reaching
 the standard size specified by the genome of the pineapple plant;
 Zinc atoms' 'goal' to deposit themselves on the cathode in the
 electrolysis of zinc chloride solution; Break-even point in
 research to achieve controlled thermonuclear fusion for industry;
 'Goal' of a column of magma ascending through Earth's crust
 to reach the atmosphere and erupt lava on the Earth's surface;
 Goal of a company to recover its investment in developing a
 new product; Puppy's goal of reaching its mother's teat while
 fighting its littermates for the same objective; Goal of a detective
 to discover the identity of a murderer; 'Goal' of the disturbed
 surface of a pond to settle back into hydrostatic (gravitational)
 equilibrium; Etc. 

<p>Although the concept of a goal in the realm of inanimate nature
 is momentarily discountenanced, several fundamental questions
 are in fact begged by this exclusion, and--certainly with revision--the
 concept may one day be be resurrected. At the very least it
 may be decided that the word should be redefined so that it
 can function in this more embracive way, since dead matter can
 be observed to behave in ways that by analogy suggest the pursuit
 and satisfaction of goals by organisms or minds. The 'goal'
 may simply be the thermodynamic end-state of a physical process
 that is relaxing toward equilibrium-regardless of whether that
 end-state is known, specifiable, or even meaningful in advance,
 or of whether it is uniquely implicit in some set of mathematical
 equations. It is also true that it is premature to absolutely
 exclude the possibility of teleological phenomena or of "final
 causes" from physical nature. Excluded possibilities in science
 have a funny way of reentering the picture years later in radically
 different dress, although this is a lesson that scientists have
 been slow to learn. 

<p>Show Paths To Goals

<p>It is possible to know, or even to prove, that a goal is attainable
 while at the same time remaining ignorant of how to actually
 achieve it. Even if all of the necessary resources and methods
 are at one's disposal, a critical sequence of steps or concatenation
 of things may elude one. An objective may hover an instant,
 layer, cell, operation, or decision away and yet be impossible
 to reach simply because the path to it is not known, well-defined,
 or available. 

<p>Ideonomy can teach general and specific ways to discover or create
 paths to specific and generic goals, and train the relevant
 skills. 

<p>It can also suggest: Whether a desired or imagined path exists
 or not or would or would not be feasible; Costs and requirements
 of finding, constructing, altering, or using paths; Things paths
 should avoid or their general hazards; Different types of paths
 that are possible or appropriate; Likely and proper quantitative
 dimensions of paths; Consequences or side effects of using different
 paths; Etc. 

<p>Clarify Good

<p>To clarify good it may be convenient, desirable, or necessary
 to first or eventually consult, define, investigate, portray,
 or even create bad. Bads and goods are both primary concerns
 of ideonomy. 

<p>Basic classes of goods are: Helps and assistance; 'Net goods';
 Virtues; Excellences; Benefits; Advantages; Ideals; Wishes and
 aims (desired things and conditions); Needed and useful resources;
 Good luck; Pleasures and pleasurable things; and 'Non-bads'
 (absences of bad; everything that is not actually bad). 

<p>The goods that interest ideonomy need not have anything to do
 with human beings or human values. Inanimate phenomena and entities--and
 'pure ideas', whatever they are--have their own agathokakological
 orders. All goods of all things should be inquired into, systematized,
 and reduced to ever more universal laws. 

<p>How can good be served, maximized, and evolved if we are ignorant
 of its kinds, possibilities, and laws? If we do not understand
 its complexities, problems, contradictions, and illusions? If
 its elements, fundamentals, needs, mechanisms, processes, and
 manifold relationships to the other things of the universe are
 unknown? 

<p>One way to begin the scientific study of good would be to examine
 the nature, circumstances, and existence of a single-random
 or particular-thing in an effort to discover all goods of or
 connected with the thing, or every way and degree in which any
 or every thing is or is not 'good' for the thing or 'from the
 thing's perspective'. 

<p>Were the thing to be given such comprehensive agathological scrutiny
 an ant, for example, one might ask and try to answer these questions:
 Is the presence of a minimum amount of water in the soil important
 to the ant's hive? Which traces of chemical elements are good
 for the ant's diet, even though they are not essential nutrients?
 Are there diseases of other soil organisms that benefit the
 ant when they occur? What polymorphisms are good or best for
 the species of ant? What wind velocity at the mouth of an ant's
 nest is optimal for the colony, in good weather? Are there certain
 early life experiences that are good for an ant to have, say
 because they trigger the emergence of latent instincts, orient
 the ant for life to the peculiarities of its environment, or
 institute certain skills in the then- plastic nervous system
 of the ant? 

<p>Lessons here could be carried over experimentally to the possible
 goods for other animal species. Discrepancies, adaptations,
 and supplementations noted through such series, networks, and
 hierarchies of comparisons could lead to an even more powerful
 generalization of agathological knowledge, methods, and skills,
 and eventually make possible the treatment of arbitrary goods
 of arbitrary things. 

<p>Another valuable ideonomic exercise would be to construct a diagram
 with the names of a random set of related or maximally diverse
 things scattered about but enclosed in ellipses. Arrows would
 be drawn between certain ellipses to indicate which things are
 or might be, in some sense or degree, good for which other things.
 Arrows could be: one-way or two-way, simple or branched, connected
 only to ellipses or also referent to or from other arrows (&agrave;
 la vergences, networks, circuitries, hierarchies, or other meta-
 structures), weighted by being thickened, colored to signify
 senses of good or goodness, etc. 

<p>Complementary sets or suites of the diagram could be created
 to exhibit or investigate the difference that various arguments,
 circumstances, or perspectives make for the possible or actual
 relationships, incremental but rational and natural changes
 in various directions (e.g. that of scaled time or probability),
 how different people would render the same diagram, etc. 

<p>Such an agathological diagram - or agathogram - could be programmed
 on a computer in a matric or dynamic form. Multivariate analysis,
 multidimensional scaling, cluster analysis, artificial intelligence
 techniques and programs, etc could be used to discover and explore
 an agathological universe - or agathocosm - of : meaningful,
 contrasting, interdependent, orthogonal, nonexistent, evolutionary,
 anamorphic, circular, cyclic, autopoietic, mathematically diverse,
 arborescent, stochastic, chaotic, aesthetically appealing, "implicate"
 (in David Bohm's sense), etc : idea spaces, permutations, combinations,
 clusters, chains, series, "rotations", inversions, representations,
 games, systems of motions and transformations, morphogeneses,
 other types of ideograms, etc. 

<p>All of the : senses, categories, types, subtypes, taxons, and
 natural taxological systems : of special or universal goods
 need to be identified, described, named, evaluated, reduced
 to operations and logic and transformations, etc. They should
 be used to : discover, imagine, investigate, characterize, compare,
 interrelate, synthesize, criticize, perfect, exploit, transcend,
 teach, etc all goods of all things.

<p>What are all known or possible dimensions for scaling goods or
 the goodness of things, and all actual scalings and co-scalings
 of all abstract and concrete goods, e.g. per: closeness, redundancy,
 co-representability or comparability, orthogonality, oppositeness,
 cost, frequency of exemplification, typological diversity, confinement
 to man (anthropomorphism) or contrary exemplification throughout
 nature, human importance, human agreement about, degree of clustering,
 logical containment or hierarchy, universal symmetry, conceptual
 simplicity, etc? 

<p>How does the same type of good vary when it is exemplified in
 different phenomena or sciences? 

<p>What are all of the goods and bads that converge in and/or diverge
 from single events? 

<p>What transvaluations of goods, or of the goodness of things,
 are possible, desirable, or inevitable? 

<p>Some illustrative genera of good are: order, harmony, efficiency,
 simplicity, reliability, strength, success, improvement, wealth,
 balance or proportion, security, freedom, opportunity, utility,
 diversity, transcendence, wisdom, power, control, productivity,
 flourishing, peace, 'health', problemlessness, salubrity, wholeness,
 meaning, challenge, consummation, certainty, purpose, direction,
 preservation, beauty, challenge, responsibility, 'fairness',
 good fortune, cleanliness, clarity, sophistication, assistance,
 synergism, truth, self-mastery, etc. 

<p>All causes of good need to be discovered, defined, distinguished,
 quantified, explained, synthesized, systematized, mastered (technologically
 and methodologically), etc. Yet the causes of both specific
 and generic goods are often esoteric. 

<p>Some possible or known causes of good are: one or more other
 goods; universal laws and relationships; nature's pervasive
 or absolute self- similarity; the subjectivity of 'goods' and
 the spatiotemporal invariances of human minds; striving for
 good; plans; methods; cooperative and coevolutionary tendencies
 of natural phenomena; evolution--incl. self- evolution and cosmic
 evolution-of things and goods; the pervasive tendency of the
 universe to order and organize itself; moral and legal laws;
 the sense of beauty; fractal, harmonic, hierarchic, vergent,
 cyclic, and other meta- patterns and meta-structures; man's
 habits of collecting, preserving, nursing, and combining goods
 or good things; early agathology; etc. 

<p>Some illustrative species or narrow examples of good are: humility,
 honesty, sanity, kindness, reverence, trust, stability, civilization,
 good habits, tolerance, gentleness, magnanimity, eloquence or
 mastery of language, longevity, altruism, grace, happiness.,
 comfort, leisure, community, scientific and technological progress,
 economic growth, wit, family strength, quiet, nonpollution of
 the environment, learning, teaching, husbandry of human resources,
 thrift, military peace, good government, manners, integrity,
 refinement of taste, and the doing of good. 

<p>Ideonomy might be used to investigate what is good for, in, about,
 or otherwise in connection with such diverse particular things
 as: soil, the family, enzymes, the human voice, an enemy, a
 friend, spiders, a spider's web, grape flavor, starlight, yard
 sales, religion, atheism, the Golgi apparatus (dictyosomes),
 war (sic), bads (sic), virtue, the crossword puzzle, seed dispersal,
 the honeybee waggle dance, filter feeding, Earth's winds, cosmic
 gravity waves, binary star systems, beaches, time, Reynold's
 number (Re = rnL/h), the alga, earth tides, psychoanalytic transference,
 intelligence tests, oneself, the unconscious mind, heat diffusion,
 proton precession, striations in electrical discharge, radioactivity,
 adjoint groups, paracompact space, exterior algebras of linear
 spaces, Fourier transforms, saddle points, overteaching, ring
 whizzers and other fluxional molecules, monomolecular films,
 certain choices of starting materials in chemistry, marine upwelling,
 the sea's internal waves, ocean spray, a falling birth rate,
 acculturation (intercultural borrowing), twinned crystals, the
 semicolon, taxation, the Swiss system of government, German
 character, boldness in war, military night operations, astronomy,
 historiographic periodization, goodwill in commerce, expressionist
 painting, the design of a safety pin, one person's handwriting,
 leveraged buyouts, corporate disclosure, FM (frequency modulation)
 radio transmission, the gear, formal education, the metaphor,
 crying, touristry to the Third World, divinities, the universe,
 the mathematical point, play, birds' nests, the chair, the theater,
 the Dirac quantum mechanical vacuum, competition, philosophy,
 the pinna, examples, music, continental drift, ultramicrophysical
 strings, etc. 

<p>The ideonomic treatment of good and bad can be pandisciplinary
 in two senses: not only can ideonomy help to treat the content
 or phenomena of all subjects, but it can at the same time be
 used to evaluate, criticize, and improve the work, organization,
 and structure of entire disciplines. 

<p>Thus it could be used to answer the question: what in the methods,
 research programs, tools, goals, foundations, concepts and theories,
 language, research foci, institutions, pedagogy, publications,
 etc of present- day biology is good and bad? 

<p>Help Treat the Hardest Things

<p>At any moment in a given field certain problems, tasks, questions,
 methods, phenomena, domains, unmet needs, goals, concepts, subfields,
 etc explicitly or implicitly exist that are the most difficult
 ones of all in that field; and a subset of these things will
 be the hardest things in human knowledge and endeavor as a whole.
 

<p>Breakthroughs in these cases are apt to cause the greatest excitement,
 have the largest consequences for those fields or for civilization,
 shift paradigms or upend cherished beliefs, reorient or revolutionize
 theoretical or experimental inquiry, initiate new fields of
 investigation, conclude or commence the longest-lived and most
 emotional squabbles, etc. 

<p>In an abstract and generic sense the hardest things are apt to
 be or relate to: Demonstrations that a postulated or implied
 entity or relationship exists or does not exist, or is possible
 or impossible; Firm proofs or disproofs of a proposition or
 hypothesis; Unifications of an entire field or theory; Proofs
 of the equivalence or nonequivalence of two fundamental things;
 Universality of some concept, law, relation, or phenomenon;
 Demonstration that a certain thing is truly fundamental or more
 fundamental than anything else known or possible; Falsification
 or modification of what are assumed to be universal or absolute
 laws, constants, theories, etc; Gaining of absolute or overriding
 control over some system, process, or phenomenon; Obtaining
 complete knowledge or understanding of a thing; Advances involving
 extremely complex or chaotic phenomena; Matters that require
 breakthroughs in pure or applied logic; Etc. 

<p>For a variety of reasons ideonomy may in the future play an important
 role in the treatment of the hardest things: It may be a fallacy
 that the hardness of solving certain classes of problems is
 fundamental, intrinsic, and irreducible--and ideonomy may help
 challenge this highly influential fallacy; it may be a fallacy
 that there is only one way to solve certain problems or answer
 certain questions--and ideonomy may have a peculiar power to
 bring to light the actual richness of possibilities; One of
 the spurs for the creation of ideonomy in the first place was
 the attempt to furnish the human mind with some universally
 more powerful instrument in the treatment of extreme difficulty
 and complexity, and in the handling of the special problems
 being created by the explosive growth of human knowledge, technology,
 and endeavor; Unexpected analogies may exist between the hardest
 things in different sciences, the concepts and methods pertinent
 thereto, the importances thereof, and even the basic solutions
 to the problems represented by such things--analogies that ideonomy
 can help to reveal and treat; Ideonomy can be used to ascertain
 and dramatize the absolute and relative need, importance, and
 consequences of achieving the hardest things; Ideonomy can systematize,
 coordinate, accelerate, and maximize the imagination and discovery
 of the totality of hardest things; Usually few people know of
 the existence, nature, and implications of the hardest things,
 and ideonomy can make such knowledge more broadly available,
 both within the relevant field and outside it; Etc. 

<p>Some illustrative examples of the hardest things are: Whether,
 in mathematics, there are fractional alefs, or whether alef
 one is or is not equivalent to the power of the continuum; Nature
 of measurement in quantum theory; Fundamental relationship between
 quantum and relativity physics; How our brain thinks or computers
 can be made to think as well or better; Fundamental relationship
 between the physical and mental aspects of nature; Basic nature
 of mathematical truth; Question as to the ultimate safety of
 scientific and technological progress, or of how to insure its
 safety; Many- body problems in mathematical physics; What the
 essential nature of life is; Whether actual infinities exist
 in nature or nature is wholly finite and discrete; Why nature
 itself exists in the first place; Extent to which our picture
 of nature is reducible to one or a few things (e.g. laws, forces,
 entities, sciences, theories, representations, phenomena, relationships,
 processes, principles, substances, problems, concepts, etc);
 Unification of gravitation with the other known fundamental
 physical forces; Isolation of the fundamental, quantitative,
 and predictive laws of society or of social behavior and development;
 Automation of artistic creation; Creation of a fully consistent,
 or comprehensive, theory of probability; Logical foundations
 of physics; Nature of randomness or its contribution to the
 physical world; Scientific basis of ethics; Why physical space
 is--or seems--tridimensional; Structure and dynamics of Dirac's
 quantum-mechanical vacuum; Ergodic theory; Information theory;
 Prediction of patterns given cellular automata will produce,
 or of the cellular automata that can generate desired or noted
 patterns; Initial conditions of 'the universe'; Long-term future
 of civilization; Measurement of gravitation's fundamental velocity
 or coupling constant to other basic forces, or detection of
 gravity waves or gravitons; Basic nature of time, or whether
 reversible travel backwards and forwards in time is feasible;
 How life began, and a priori probability of its origin or repeated
 origin (around the universe ); Basic structure of the universe;
 How to civilize human nature or the earth--or extinguish war
 and crime; How much of the human mind is inherited from the
 human genome; What the quantity of nonsense in the world is;
 Etc. 

<p>What are all of the hardest problems and possibilities that are
 connected with a single, random or particular, thing? 

<p>Where would all of the examples of hardest things that were mentioned
 above fall on a universal scale of degrees of hardness? Which
 of the things would be most ambiguous or hard to place on such
 a scale? 

<p>What hierarchies of hardest things are there? Also what series,
 networks, trees, rings (sic), clusters, etc? 

<p>Which of the things listed above should be tackled first and
 last --and why? 

<p>Are there things that are by definition, or that can be proven
 in advance to be, infinitely hard to accomplish or know? 

<p>Where would the examples of hardest things above all fall on
 a scale giving the imagined quantity of future time that will
 or must elapse before that which they speak of becomes known
 or is achieved? 

<p>What are the basic reasons for the hardness of each of those
 things? 

<p>Which of those apparent or supposed hardnesses may in fact be
 illusory? 

<p>On the other hand, which of all those things that would seem
 to us easy to accomplish or know in the future, may actually
 turn out to be hard or among the hardest of possibilities? 

<p>What were the hardest problems historically and how were they
 solved? Moreover, what resulted from their solution or explanation-and
 what lessons may there be for us now as we confront those things
 that for ourselves are the hardest to come to terms with? 

<p>Describe Hierarchies

<p>From the point of view of ideonomy, an infinite number and variety
 of hierarchies may well exist in and as nature, and all things,
 in some sense, may be hierarchical or possess hierarchical aspects,
 elements, and relationships. 

<p>The foreseen task is to find and define the totality of such
 hierarchies and hierarchical relationships, to identify the
 laws thereof, and to progressively exploit the opportunities
 implicit in such things. 

<p>Of course hierarchy represents just one of the basic genera of
 so-called meta-structures that presumably pervade the universe
 or 'reality', but the exemplifications, meanings, and possibilities
 of each such genus must be thoroughly investigated and elaborated.
 The case of hierarchy can serve as a general example of what
 must be done and of what is apt to follow upon the doing of
 it. 

<p>What is meant by the word or concept of hierarchy? One way to
 answer this question is by seeing what hierarchy could mean--or
 what hierarchies may in fact, or could in theory, exist--in
 connection with a variety of things. For example: 

<p>Could there be a hierarchy of snowflakes? Actually there could
 be many such hierarchies: Presumably there is a probability
 spectrum for different flake shapes; Formative mechanisms may
 be plural or subject to complication or external influences,
 in which case either the causes or their effects may canonically
 progress in chains and branch in--chronological or nomological--
 trees; Probability or existence of certain flake forms may be
 a function of the set-theoretic statistics or combinatorial
 clustering of other flake forms; Etc. 

<p>A hierarchy of winters? Perhaps winters can be multidimensionally
 described and there are certain types of winters that are only
 likely to to occur after, or somewhere in the middle of, certain
 sequences of other types of winters; Perhaps there is a hierarchy
 of descriptions or of descriptive elements, such that certain
 descriptions or elements are more fundamental or at least simpler
 than others, and it is appropriate or necessary to 'move along'
 the hierarchy in attempting to characterize winters; Etc. 

<p>A hierarchy of stars? Certain stars generate chemical elements
 and isotopes that are then recycled in other stars and without
 which those other types and generations of stars are impossible;
 Similar stellar hierarchy may exist thanks to the production,
 recycling, multistage transformation, or control of different
 molecular species by generations--or perhaps by synchronic hierarchies--of
 stars; Hierarchical sets of stars may create different physical
 conditions at a variety of levels (e.g. of stellar density)
 that induce special types of stars, or of stellar behavior,
 at those levels; Etc. 

<p>Possible or actual properties, dimensions, or features of hierarchies
 or of their contents include: Elements; Sets, subsets, and supersets;
 Levels; Degrees; Layers; Ranges; Intervals; Gaps; Folia; Partitions;
 Stages; Chains or sequences; Series; Harmonics or powers; Units
 and multiples; Domination and subordination; Supreme commander;
 Tops, apexes, vertexes, etc; Bottoms, bases, roots, foundations,
 etc; Starts, origins, first things, a single beginner, etc;
 Stops, finishes, last things, etc; Greatest or maximal thing;
 Least or minimal things or thing; Thresholds; Transformations;
 Rhythms, cycles, iterations, reappearances, etc; Poles, orientations,
 etc; Inversions; Transitivity; Asymmetry; Antisymmetry; Control,
 government, or regulation; Ranks; Superiority; One-many relationships;
 Trees or arborescence; Direction; Unidirectional action; Dependences,
 independences, and interdependences; Monotonic progression;
 Emergence; Equivalent and nonequivalent elements; Simplicity;
 Internal structure and external form; Completeness and all-
 inclusiveness; Horizontal and vertical relationships; Rules;
 Defined or exact relationships; Continuity; Universality; Pyramidality;
 Discrete and continuous aspects; Opposites, antipolarity, and
 antisyzygies; Uniqueness or singularity; Unity-in-diversity;
 Spectrums; Convergence, divergence, and vergence; Orthogonality;
 Etc. 

<p>Possible effects, values, or uses of hierarchies include: Arbitrarily
 large sets of things or elements can be connected, reduced,
 related, or traced back to, or derived from, just a single thing,
 element:, point, event, law, etc.--via a path that is at once
 maximally short, powerful, comprehensive, logical, necessary,
 central, self-similar, ubiquitous, etc; Causation, perturbation,
 government, etc can be shown to be, or treated as being, completely
 unidirectional and an incremental and comprehensive flow over
 an arbitrarily large set of identical or diverse things, processes,
 phenomena, domains, effects, changes, events, etc; Time-asymmetric
 evolution of an entire system or universe; Flows in two opposite
 and paired directions can be enabled or defined--flows of an
 opposite, complementary, reciprocal, or independent nature or
 content; Things or processes of every possible size, number,
 or complexity can all be 'reduced' to the dimidiations, doublings,
 bifurcations, partitionings, iterations, recursions, fractal
 structure, or the like of a single thing, process, pattern,
 or the like--so that the smallest and largest scales or sets,
 first and last things, whole and parts, e/vc of the hierarchy
 are mutually derived, antisyzygially, in an exact or approximate
 way; Generalization, specialization, and their interdetermination;
 Alternative descriptions, classifications, or treatments of
 things can be rigorously excluded; Possibilities can be constrained;
 Different and disjunct trees of possibilities can be differentiated
 and selected; Things can be described or controlled via the
 simplest language, code, logic, or information-theoretic structure;
 Operations or actions can be reduced to uniquely consecutive
 and finite decisions; Variables can be treated as constants,
 and constants as variables, at successive 'levels'; Those degrees
 of freedom that enable the self- organization of a phenomenon
 or realm can be increased or maximized; Potential or actual
 self-interaction, self-government, self-connection, autocorrelation,
 self-description, complexity, heterogeneity, proteanness, e/vc
 of a thing or phenomenon can be maximized; Use of resources
 can be optimized, or need for resources minimized; Redundancy
 can be minimized, irredundancy maximized (and vice versa, paradoxically);
 Etc. 

<p>In a simpler way, hierarchies or hierarchization can serve, i.
 a.: classification, description, definition, development, morphogenesis,
 evolution, transformation, revolution, generalization, specialization,
 integration, isolation, amplification, analogization, distinguishing,
 specification, individuation, universalization, organization,
 self- organization, control, government, meetings of opposites,
 simplification, complexification, randomization, localization,
 innovation, distribution, centralization, decentralization,
 self-reference, operationalization or processualization, conservation,
 conceptualization, mechanization, simulation or modeling, proceduralization,
 stratification, cooperation, diversification, nomogenesis (sensu
 either the discovery of laws, or their emergence and evolution),
 systemization, correction or adjustment, adaptation, stabilization,
 selection, search, checking, supervision, coordination, communication,
 compilation, colligation, assimilation, convergence, divergence,
 'parsing', counting, etc. 

<p>More specifically, hierarchy or hierarchization serve or are
 exemplified in or by: e.g. memory (or memorization and recall),
 recognition, thought, bodily action, feeling, psychogenesis,
 social evolution, biosynthesis, the evolution of life, cosmogony,
 parallel computation, industrialization, human government, military
 organization and strategy, nervous systems and artificial neural
 nets, computer hardware and software, evolution and classification
 of mathematical ideas, the process or result of painting, accounting,
 language translation, literary analysis (as of a novel), family
 relationships, the immunal system or immunogenesis, ecological
 structure and processes, genomic structure and function, ontogenesis,
 social stratification, structure and traffic dynamics of a nation's
 road system, etc. 

<p>Particularly or peculiarly interesting genera of hierarchies
 in this list are in upper case. Many suggest fascinating problems,
 questions, and possibilities--which ideonomy will eventually
 address. 

<p>Actually many things need to be learned about all of those genera.
 Thus what are all of their: exemplifications, specializations,
 causes, effects, roles, interrelations and interactions, laws,
 activities, structures, transformations, histories, futures,
 evolutions and retrogressions, fine structure, etc? 

<p>Hierarchy can be defined in many different ways. The dictionary
 distinguishes: (1) The arrangement of objects, elements, or
 values in a graduated series; (2) A series of objects, elements,
 or values so arranged; (3) In logic, a series the members of
 which are grouped in accordance with a principle (as of importance,
 perfection, or priority); (4) The stratification so achieved;
 specifically, a table of statistical correlations having a constant
 proportional relationship and graded from high to low; (5) A
 body of persons or things ranked in grades, orders, or classes,
 one above another; a system or series of terms of successive
 rank, used in classification (as in biology). 

<p>Additionally, of the adjective "hierarchical" it says: (6) Having
 the power to control; influential.
