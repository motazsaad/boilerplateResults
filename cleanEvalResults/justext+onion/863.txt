<p>Malachi 3:19-20aFor look, the Day is coming, glowing like a furnace.
 All the proud and all the evil-doers will be the stubble, and
 the Day, when it comes, will set them ablaze, says Yahweh Sabaoth,
 leaving them neither root nor branch. But for you who fear my
 name, the Sun of justice will rise with healing in his rays,
 and you will come out leaping like calves from the stall

<p>Dear Reader of The Peace Pulpit,
