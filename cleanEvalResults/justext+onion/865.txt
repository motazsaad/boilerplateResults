<p>President Festus Mogae is leader of Botswana, one of the countries
 hit hardest by the Aids epidemic.

<p> Thirty-five percent - more than one in three - of the country's
 adult population are infected with the HIV virus, according
 to government figures.

<p>HIV and Aids have also left up to 80,000 children orphaned in
 Botswana and dramatically reduced life expectancy in the country
 to 49 years. 

<p> President Mogae has pledged to invest much of the country's
 annual budget in tackling the crisis. His ground-breaking antiretroviral
 drugs programme has made Botswana the first country in sub-Saharan
 Africa to provide universal, free access to the medicines. 

<p>How does President Mogae intend to stop the spread of Aids in
 Botswana? What does the future hold for one of the countries
 hit hardest by HIV and Aids?

<p>This programme will be available to watch from this page shortly.
 It will also be broadcast on BBC World TV and BBC World Service
 Radio on Sunday, 30 November at 1400 GMT. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
 Welcome to Talking Point and I'm Roger Hearing
 broadcasting on BBC World on television, BBC World Service on
 radio and BBC News Online on the internet. Today we're in Gaborone,
 capital of Botswana and our guest is the president of Botswana
 - Festus Mogae. Welcome to the programme Mr President. 

<p> Today our subject is HIV/Aids. This is a disease that has devastated
 Botswana. Botswana is in many ways a very fortunate country
 - it has enormous mineral wealth and a stable democracy, up
 until recently it had the highest income and the highest life
 expectancies in the region. Now unfortunately it has another
 distinction - it's got the highest incidence of HIV/Aids in
 the world. Up to a third of the population are believed to be
 HIV positive. 

<p> We'll go to our first caller in a moment but first of all, Mr
 President, can I ask you why is it that Botswana has such a
 high incidence of HIV/Aids? It's a country that's actually,
 as I said, very fortunate, it should have all the advantages,
 why would it have got to this situation? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
 Well disease is disease - we have an
 open society, people come and go, I don't think HIV originated
 in Botswana. It came here and it has stayed. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
Do you think that the way the government is
 tackling it is actually likely to make much of a difference
 or is there something here that makes it a much more difficult
 country to rid of the disease? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
 Whilst we believe in what we are doing,
 we think that ultimately it should make a difference. Maybe
 not as fast as we would like but we think it is already making
 a difference. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
 Thank you very much indeed for the moment Mr
 President. Let's take our first caller now: Dinah Bogale is
 on the line from here in Botswana. Dinah what's your question
 to President Mogae? 

<p>
Dinah Bogate:
What I see is that HIV and Aids is prevalent among
 the youth in my country and it escalates every minute of every
 day. And I think this is primarily due to the lack of youth
 empowerment. There are so many school dropouts, some are graduates
 who are out on the streets without any job. So what I see happening
 is these people they get involved in use of alcohol and drugs
 and they end up having unprotected sex. 

<p> So my question is: as much as the government is tackling the
 HIV and Aids infected people why doesn't it use the same strength
 to tackle youth employment because through youth employment
 I believe that the youth would have something else to do rather
 than indulge in drugs and alcohol and as a result have unprotected
 sex? 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
Dinah thanks very much for that. I hope you
 were able to hear that question Mr President, what's your answer
 to that? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
She's saying why are we not empowering
 the youth these days, that people are infected because they
 are out of work. That's not true - it's obvious to everybody.
 We are losing university students, we are losing high school
 students, we are losing young professionals in good employment.
 Yes of course the level of unemployment is unacceptably high
 at between 16 and 18% but it's much better than in most African
 countries. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
You don't think poverty is an issue then? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
Poverty has always been an issue but
 not in Botswana. There is no correlation between income level
 and HIV/Aids. I'm saying to you that we are losing young professionals.
 The most affected population group is 15 to 49. Now the people
 between 15 and 18 and even 20 and up to 22, most of them are
 still in secondary and tertiary institutions at government expense,
 free without any cost. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
Let me just read out an e-mail that we've received
 Mr President from Rob in the United States. Rob says: Having
 been to Botswana and seen the rather casual way married men
 and women co-mingle with ample supplies alcohol readily available,
 what lifestyle changes are you proposing for your population?
 I think that's in a way what Dinah was saying - there is a matter
 of what people do, what young people do in particular, when
 alcohol is around and the kind of lifestyle they live, how do
 you answer that? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
Well we are giving serious thought to
 alcohol and substance abuse. Obviously alcohol is a contributory
 factor, not only in the case of HIV but also to road accidents.
 Contrary to what the young lady was saying, a lot of young people
 here own cars and they drive them fast and they die like flies
 on the roads. Yes, that is associated with alcohol. We are thinking
 about it, in fact we have a liquor law in draft to maybe reduce
 the opening hours for liquor outlets and various other measures.
 

<p> But that doesn't explain why we are the most seriously affected
 country in the world. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
 So there's something beyond that. 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
I freely acknowledge that alcohol is
 a contributory factor. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
 Thanks very much. Let's take another call now
 from Ngassa Elvis in Brescia in Italy. Ngassa what's your question
 to President Festus Mogae? 

<p>
Ngassa Elvis: 
 Thank you. Good afternoon Mr President. I would
 like to make a comment. I would like to call your attention
 to the fact that there are thousands of African doctors and
 medical students all over Europe and many of them are eager
 to go back home if jobs are guaranteed and working conditions
 are good. 

<p> I, as an African medical student, I'm of Cameroonian origin,
 I think that we must be the ones to spearhead the fight against
 Aids in Africa, Botswana included. I believe it is quite unfair
 that European expats should be the main protagonists in the
 fight. Meanwhile thousands of African doctors are working here.
 I think the best way Europe can help Africa is to help Africa
 help itself. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
 What's your response to that? Should it be
 African doctors really, perhaps African doctors currently working
 in Europe or abroad who are brought back to help? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
I think it should be everybody including
 and especially African doctors. Here in Botswana we are actually
 dependent on many African doctors from Tanzania, Uganda, Zimbabwe,
 Zambia and of course doctors from elsewhere. We would like to
 hire more doctors and especially African doctors abroad but
 we don't think we can afford it. African doctors working in
 the United States or in Europe are working there partly because
 the remuneration is very attractive. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
But you're quite a rich country, surely you
 could pay them enough to get them to come back? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
We are a poor country. Our per capita
 income is $3,000 compared to your $40,000 in the United Kingdom,
 so we cannot be reasonably expected to afford the level of remuneration
 that these people command as professionals - as medical professionals.
 But we are, by African standards, we are paid better than most
 African countries and that's why we have African doctors here.
 We are in fact dependent on African doctors. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
 Let's take up that point with a medical student
 from Botswana who's on the line. Maxwell Nhlatho is on the line
 in fact from Melbourne in Australia. Maxwell would you come
 back and help Botswana do you think? 

<p>
Maxwell Nhlatho: 
Yes, yes I'd be looking forward to working
 Botswana. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
 What question would you like to put to President
 Mogae? 

<p>
Maxwell Nhlatho: 
My concern is from the cultural differences
 that we have in Botswana with the rest of the world. It is totally
 unacceptable in Botswana as a youngster bringing your girlfriend
 or your boyfriend home. I think the people of Botswana should
 accept the fact that as youngsters we do grow up and our parents
 need to be aware of that and they need to protect us. I think
 this kind of behaviour of not accepting us to bring our girlfriends
 or partners or our parents to know our girlfriends - it's not
 protecting the youth of Botswana. It's rather increasing the
 chances that we end up with many different partners and I think
 it's really dangerous for us. 

<p> I don't fully understand why Aids in Botswana is still on the
 rise. I mean as everyone in Botswana knows about Aids. They
 know the seriousness of AIDS, they know its consequences but
 still it is still on the rise, I don't understand that. In Melbourne
 university, other medical students from Botswana, we set up
 a group we decided to call it BAM, which stands for Botswana
 Aids Melbourne. This was sort of an initiative to set up a youth
 to youth HIV education programmes in Botswana with the help
 of the University of Melbourne as a way to develop some education
 programmes that could help Botswana. And we are looking forward
 to really working in Botswana. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
Well Maxwell let me put that question to the
 President. President Mogae what do you respond to that? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
 It is interesting that he's saying
 that traditional values, where the young people are not bringing
 their girlfriends and boyfriends home, is responsible. A great
 many people here think that the breakdown of our traditional
 habits and norms is the one that has resulted in the breakdown
 of family relationships because the young people now can kiss
 in public and walk hand in hand in front of adults and in front
 of their parents. But that's what people are saying. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
So it's too much liberalisation rather than
 too much conservatism. 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
 There's too much liberalisation rather
 than too much conservatism. And I'm inclined to agree with the
 too much liberalisation. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
So you think that's at root part of the problem?
 

<p>
President Festus Mogae: 
I think that it must be a contributory
 factor. I am not willing to say any one single factor is responsible
 but I think it's one of them. I myself have made statements
 both in general public meetings and in parliament that we should
 have more discipline, especially in senior secondary schools.
 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
Let me read you out an e-mail we've received
 from Thomas O'Brien in the United States. Thomas says: Should
 you not be pressing changes in certain aspects of African culture.
 I believe a campaign should be underway to iterate the need
 to wear condoms as protection from the deadly disease. Do you
 not think in the culture we're talking about there is a resistance
 to that perhaps in the traditional culture which may be part
 of the problem? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
There may well be. But some people are
 accusing us of introducing too much liberalism - even churchmen
 have accused the government of being responsible and encouraging
 the youth to participate early in sex because we not only preach
 the use of condoms, we supply them free in all public institutions.
 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
 Well in fact the Catholic Church opposes the
 use of condoms. 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
And the Catholic church, in particular,
 but some of the other churches and also some of the other traditionalists.
 They say we understand that message that people should abstain,
 especially young people should postpone their active participation
 in sex and postpone sexual activity until marriage. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
 Do you think that's a practical way forward,
 do you think it's right to do that? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
 Well we think it's a valid message
 and I think that the young people could do that. I mean after
 all they're not yet used to sexual activity and if they then
 do, then they should stick to one partner. And in any case if
 they indulge in sexual activity they should use condoms. So
 that's why it's called ABC - if you go around Gaborone you will
 see this message. The message is abstain, stick to one partner
 or condomise. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
So you abstain, be faithful and condoms - ABC.
 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
 Yes various formulations of the same
 thing. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
Let's go now to another caller. Gustav Colliander
 is on the line from Scotland. Gustav what's your question to
 President Mogae? 

<p>
Gustav Colliander: 
I'd like to congratulate you on having the
 most democratic and stable government in Africa. I'd like to
 say that I've recently travelled all around Southern Africa,
 I spent a few months travelling around, and I spoke to quite
 a few locals there and it seems to be a very common practice
 in that area of that world that a man will openly have a wife
 and have girlfriends and mistresses and so on and that because
 of this - I mean having condoms is not really the whole issue,
 so to speak, as far as I'm concerned. People must change their
 behaviour and obviously use condoms where applicable but condoms
 fail from time to time, so it's changing how society behaves
 and what is accepted society norms. What is the President and
 his government doing to try and change what is an acceptable
 part of society to try and prevent this from happening? 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
Alright Gustav well let's hear from the President.
 Are you undertaking measures to change the way that society
 lives? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
 I was explaining to the caller just
 before him, that our prevention campaign is that people should
 abstain from sex. They should be faithful or stick to one partner
 and then of course we say they should use condoms because the
 condom - and the reason why it's ABC and C is condom is that
 a condom is a fallback position. The ideal is to abstain especially
 for young people and for the rest is that they should stick
 to one partner. That's the behaviour change we are looking for.
 

<p> We have asked the churches to help us in this message - to preach
 it in their own churches. We have asked them - we do not expect
 them to preach the use of condoms - we expect them to preach
 abstinence, we expect them to preach being faithful or sticking
 to one partner. But that hopefully - even if they don't like
 us advocating the use of condoms they should at least not speak
 against them. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
Okay let me put that back to Gustav. The President
 is saying in effect that he's already doing that, they're doing
 their best to encourage this behaviour but it perhaps isn't
 practical unless you have the C of the ABC which is condoms
 as well, what do you think? 

<p>
Gustav Colliander: 
Obviously I'm not saying don't use condoms
 but obviously you have to. But what I'm saying is that when
 I was talking to people there, especially the men, it's an open
 society norm that they would have multiple girlfriends and so
 on at the same time as having a wife. It is like an accepted
 part of being an Southern African in that sort of area of the
 world, it's what they seem to accept. You've got to try and
 create the situation where people are shameful to say they've
 got lots of girlfriends at the same time. It should be that
 they shouldn't want to brag about it. 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
I agree entirely with Gustav but social
 change or change of attitude, behaviour change, doesn't come
 overnight but that's what we have been trying to preach. And
 in fact we are saying that you can see the consequences and
 therefore the only thing we should do is to change our behaviour.
 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
Okay, let's go to another caller now. Taylor
 Ahlgren is on the line also from Botswana. Taylor, what question
 would you like to put to President Mogae? 

<p>
Taylor Ahlgren: 
 Yes hello President Mogae. I've been here
 for approximately five months now, I'm living in Gaborone and
 I've really enjoyed getting to interact with the local culture
 and have been making some friends already and really enjoying
 living here. 

<p> One thing that I have noticed is a great fear, especially amongst
 18 to 30 year old range that I've been interacting and spending
 some time with, a great fear about discussing HIV/Aids, just
 on a casual level. It seems like there's a strong stigma here
 against those that do have HIV/Aids and those that do have done
 wrong. It seems like many in Botswana here are even afraid to
 get tested because of this strong fear. 

<p> I was really impressed that you announced your negative HIV
 status to the public and I was wondering what else is being
 focused on from your government in order to increase discussion
 within the public about HIV? Because I think - going back to
 your last question about changing behaviour, increasing discussion
 about HIV/AIDS on just a friendly peer level can greatly lead
 to behavioural change. So that's my question - what else is
 being pursued? 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
Let's put that to President Mogae, what else
 do you have to try and change the stigma that's attached to
 all this? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
 It's the most difficult part - there
 is stigma and has been for some time and for a long time - for
 the last couple of years people are not willing to talk about
 it - first about sexual matters and secondly about the HIV/Aids
 pandemic. But I should have thought that that has changed very
 substantially because now whenever I make a public statement
 or address meetings - whenever ministers and members of parliament
 address public meetings they speak about HIV/Aids. We never
 make address public meetings without talking about HIV/Aids
 and I think the public officials, not only health officials,
 as was the case at the beginning. But I must acknowledge that
 stigma persists, stigma persists and I agree and that is part
 of the reason why many people are reluctant to know their HIV
 status because of the social stigma attached to the disease.
 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
But you yourself had a test and was clear. 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
 Yes I had a test but it's only part
 of the effort to try and encourage people to know their status
 especially as antiretroviral therapy is available. One tries
 to say look it's very important to know your status, your HIV
 status, so that if you are negative then you try to remain negative
 and if you are positive you can get be assisted. Being positive
 is no longer the death sentence that it used to be and that
 HIV is just a disease like any other. 

<p> But you know stigma is very difficult. Even some of the people
 who want to help - take the church people - to start with churches
 used to say that Aids is a punishment from God because we have
 sinned and therefore it follows therefore that those who were
 HIV positive were the sinners. We have convinced the churches
 that that is the wrong interpretation. But the stigma persists.
 But some people say well know your status and come out, please
 come out. There are people there who are HIV positive, and are
 hiding - that's stigmatising. You may have syphilis, it's sexually
 transmitted, if it's untreated it also can be terminal. But
 nobody says you may have syphilis come out and get tested. Or
 you may have hepatitis B, which is also sexually transmitted.
 But they say you may have Aids, that's sexually transmitted,
 come out - that's stigmatisation. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
You had an HIV test - would you encourage all
 your ministers to do it, would that help perhaps? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae: 
Many of them have. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
Would you ask them all to do it perhaps - would
 that be a way forward? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae: 
Well I will, I have asked them and
 they are testing - even members of parliament. Just this week
 three members of parliament were tested and announced it. What
 we are doing is that with the effect from the 1st January, anybody
 who goes to a government medical facility and needs to be tested
 unless they refuse they will be tested for HIV/Aids. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
Let me read you out an e-mail we've received
 from Freddy Munyololo Muganza in South Africa. Freddy says:
 Do you think that investing a lot of money in drug delivery
 will actually jeopardise necessary behaviour change? In effect
 will all this money you're putting in to antiretrovirals mean
 people think well it doesn't really matter what I do? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
 No I don't think so because people
 are still dying, because many people are not coming forward.
 If they took that attitude that after all there are drugs then
 presumably they would be coming forward and then they would
 then be treated and that would be alright. But if they are not
 coming forward. We have voluntary counselling and testing centres
 and we are complaining that they are not used to the extent
 that we would like. That means that a lot of people are still
 not coming forward. If they were, if they thought that because
 there are drugs then they would test and even if they are positive
 they'd be treated anyway, they would be coming forward. Therefore
 their present behaviour is not consistent with their believing
 that there is no punishment. In any case the death toll is maybe
 not increasing I've no evidence that it's increasing - it may
 be stabilising but it's still very high. 

<p> Then as I say this is not ignorant people. It's as I said, the
 most severely affected population is the 15 to 49 year-old and
 within that cohort it's 18 to 24. Those people are not ignorant
 and they understand very well that these antiretrovirals are
 palliatives, they can prolong your life but there is no cure.
 In fact in Setswana, the literal translation means a palliative.
 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
Let's go now to another caller, Michael Jordan
 is on the line from Sao Paolo, Brazil. Michael what's your question
 to President Mogae? 

<p>
Michael Jordan: 
 Well firstly I'd like to thank President Mogae
 for speaking with us today, I think his leadership has been
 exemplary in the area of HIV and Aids so I appreciate this very
 much. President Mogae I would like to know what is the root
 cause of the behavioural patterns that seem to persist despite
 wide awareness of the dangers of unprotected sex? These patterns
 seem to be deeply entrenched and not just within Botswana but
 basically within a number of countries in Southern Africa and
 Eastern Africa. How do we attack not so much the social interaction
 that's open from the churches and the media but when two people
 get behind closed doors? How do we influence the decision making
 at that level? 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
The line was bad to Sao Paolo. Let me repeat
 what I think Michael was talking about. He was talking about
 the root cause of the short-term decision making that people
 have - a kind of blindness in terms of sexual behaviour despite
 the obvious risks that that entails. What can one do to change
 people's minds on this? To widen their eyes, I suppose you could
 say to the risks. 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
I would have thought that Michael would
 offer me advice as to what else I should be doing because the
 adverts are exactly what I've been preaching - that it's very
 dangerous. Somebody in the United States in Washington said
 that President Museveni says that they overcame the pandemic
 because they said abstain or have sex and die. So I said well
 it may not be the style of our language but we are virtually
 saying that. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
 But you don't think that particular style would
 work in Botswana? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
Not necessarily. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
Because it's too scary, because its too frightening,
 because its too explicit? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
No because people are aware that if
 you contact Aids you die. If they didn't think so there would
 be no stigma. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
So are people just ignoring the dangers then?
 Are they saying I don't want to think about it? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
It seems to be the case. I am telling
 you what we are doing so tell me what you think what else we
 ought to be doing because if I thought something would work
 I would be trying it already. If you think I am not doing it,
 it is because I haven't thought of it. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
Let's go now to another caller - Grace A Owuor,
 is on the line from Washington, USA. Grace what's your question
 to President Mogae? 

<p>
Grace Owuor: 
Thank you so much for your ground breaking decision.
 I'm originally from Kenya and I grew up here in the United States
 and most of my young days I spent in Kenya. I have an aunt who
 died of Aids about six or seven years ago and I completely agree
 with the stigma being the key issue that it's keeping a lot
 of the progress needed against the Aids pandemic. 

<p> My question is more geared towards the children. I was of course
 reading about Botswana's 35% Aids infection rate and that of
 course hit me that the numbers of children who are being orphaned
 is very huge. You mentioned 80% in the article that I saw in
 the BBC. I just want to know what is being done to incubate
 these children? Because as we've seen throughout Africa, Liberia
 and different parts of our continent, a lot of these rebels
 are children and often some of them may be victims of parents
 who've passed away as a result of Aids. 

<p> In Kenya we have what are called small community based organisations
 called Grandmothers for Orphans. Because as you know when children's
 parents pass away it's left to either their grandmothers, uncles
 and aunts to support them. I'm just wondering if you have those
 types of organisations and if you thought about having some
 sort of a social system to support those organisations if they
 exist? That was my first question. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
Let's put that to President Mogae and then we'll
 come back to your other question. President Mogae what is the
 situation with Aids orphans here in Botswana? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
 All orphans are registered. Of course
 to start with we're seeing Aids orphans, we changed that because
 in any case 30% of the orphans are orphaned because of road
 accidents. Also we thought that calling them Aids orphans is
 stigmatising in the children. So we have registered 41,000 orphans
 to date. They are entitled to support from government - food
 rations, clothing, everything that they need. 

<p> Those of them who are HIV positive are entitled to antiretrovirals
 free. But beyond that, we have the prevention of mother to child
 transmission, so that expectant mothers who attend the antenatal
 clinics are tested. And if they agree, they are then put on
 a programme so that they are given antiretrovirals for a few
 weeks before delivery and a few weeks after and then the child
 is also given AZT and nevirapine. So that in fact 60% of the
 children now born of HIV positive mothers don't have the virus
 - government support starts there. We provide infant formula
 and we now encourage the mothers - depending how advanced their
 situation is - not to breastfeed, which is a reversal of our
 policy. We have been encouraging breastfeeding - now we are
 saying it's better if you don't breastfeed. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
It's too dangerous to breastfeed. 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
Too dangerous. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
Let me go quickly back to Grace and Grace had
 one more question I believe, Grace what was your second question?
 

<p>
Grace Owuor::
 Yes sir, this is a little bit off but it's kind
 of relevant to the subject. My question was you know in most
 countries and throughout the world there are deaf people. I'm
 wondering how communities are communicating with deaf people
 about - especially in the rural areas - about those who are
 dying around them and if they are aware of the Aids virus and
 if there's a way in which the government communicates to people
 who have illnesses that prevent them from communicating well
 and may be actually infected? 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 

<p>
Thanks for that Grace. President? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
Well we use our best endeavours to communicate
 but obviously in the more remote areas one can't guarantee that
 the communication is as effective as it is around town. Because
 in the towns there are schools - there are two institutions
 for deaf people and therefore we're able to communicate with
 them through sign language and others, there are social workers,
 not enough of them of course, who are trained in sign language.
 But in a country, in a developing country about the size of
 Kenya and a population of 1.7 million people there are lot of
 remote areas where some of the things that are happening in
 the bigger settlements will probably not be reaching these communities
 as well as they should. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
 Let's widen the discussion out a little bit.
 We've received an e-mail from Jason Jeffery in Zimbabwe, a neighbouring
 country to yours. Jason says: Is the fight against HIV in your
 country threatened by the continuing rise of illegal immigrants
 from Zimbabwe due to the growing political crisis there? Is
 this one of the justifications for the increased levels of security
 along the border? How would you answer that? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
That's a difficult one because it's
 likely to be misunderstood, I mean to the extent that there
 are illegal immigrants. We hire a lot of Zimbabwean professionals.
 I said earlier to somebody that we are dependent on African
 professionals and we hire a great many people from Zimbabwe
 with skills. But there are of course in addition - there are
 a lots of skilled and unskilled workers who come into the country
 illegally. We send about a thousand back every week but they
 come right back. Well to the extent that these people are living
 uncertain lives and so on, I don't think they're helping the
 situation. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
Do you think they're actually bringing HIV into
 the country? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
 Well no we find HIV here. There's HIV
 in Zimbabwe, in Zambia and in Botswana, so how can I say they
 are bringing HIV here when there is HIV here and in South Africa?
 It's in the region as a whole. The only difference is that -
 the only reason why we are different is that we were the first
 to explain to the rest of the world that we are more seriously
 affected. So it's not the Zimbabweans. 

<p> He asked about security measures. Well there are a lot of social
 problems and whenever there is a rural urban migration, as happens
 in all developing countries, all African countries, and other
 developing countries, that tends to breed crime in the urban
 areas and to the extent that there are illegal immigrants, they
 would tend to exacerbate, not cause, exacerbate a problem that
 already is there. And so I hope that the people of Zimbabwe
 and everybody will understand and yes, illegal immigration tends
 to exacerbate already existing problems - whether it's crime
 or whether it's HIV/Aids or STDs in general. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
Mr President you mentioned earlier the efforts
 in Uganda. We actually have a caller on line Job from Kampala
 in Uganda. Job what's your question to President Mogae? 

<p>
Job:
I want to welcome the President to the programme and I
 want to thank him for appearing on the programme to address
 this particular issue of Aids. We know it has been around for
 quite some time, I don't know at what rate it has been multiplying,
 I don't have these statistics at hand because it has been around
 - at least it was here in the 80s when I was a teenager and
 now I'm in my thirties. 

<p> In the late '90s that's when it exploded so much in Uganda and
 apparently in Kenya. And then currently in Uganda apparently
 they are reporting on seeing that the rate at which it is multiplying
 has gone down and in Kenya it seems to have exploded much more.
 I don't know what's happening in other nations that are not
 African. But according to the little I hear about like China
 it's not doing so well in that area of Aids. 

<p> So one thing I wanted his Excellency maybe to talk about is
 by politicians coming into this, do they really help the spread
 to go down or they just try and maybe publicise it so that the
 nation knows that it is there? The input I wanted to put in
 was that the solution to AIDS to me I feel like it doesn't lay
 with the politicians at all, politicians just take credit like
 our president in Uganda takes credit. Like he throws in the
 Aids infection has gone down but I doubt whether that is the
 case. Politicians don't take any credit in this one particular
 thing at all, maybe people just got to know about it because
 the presidents are talking about it. Do they lead the population?
 Are they also showing the population that this is how I am living
 and I'm living in a moral way so that Aids is not spreading?
 Do they give a moral leadership in that that particular issue?
 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
 Alright, let me put that then to the President.
 Also let me put to you another e-mail we've received, in fact
 from Michael in Uganda who says: How can his Excellency explain
 the fact that Botswana with its high GDP has not been able to
 set up a front in the field of research on Aids vaccine in Africa?
 Questions really there about political leadership. Let's deal
 first then with Job's question - do you think politicians can
 really make a difference? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
Well I think they should endeavour to
 make a contribution. Certainly one contribution they can make,
 they can use the state machinery and make their own effort to
 let the population know the situation in which the particular
 country is in. The majority of people in the world feel that
 we African leaders have not done enough. They also said we have
 been silent about the pandemic etc. etc. and may be it is true
 but that was partly because of our invasion by the virus was
 by stealth given its very nature. So that by the time we became
 aware the predicament in which we were it was perhaps too late.
 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
 Well the warnings came from a long time ago
 - even the late 1980s, mid 1980s, it was apparent that some
 countries in Africa were suffering very badly. 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
Well beginning with Uganda itself but
 that's what happens. So he was saying that he thinks that politicians
 are irrelevant - no I don't think they are irrelevant. I think
 everybody has a role to play, even if it's only to warn the
 nation of the problem. Church people have a role to play and
 thus other people also have roles to play. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
What about the science question? What about
 the setting up the search for a vaccine, which is what Michael
 was asking about? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
 We have one of the leading laboratories
 here which we built and it's being operated by the Harvard Aids
 Institute. You could go and have a look at it - a lot of people
 know about it. There is a great deal of research now - there
 are at least half a dozen institutes who are doing research
 here in the country. We're being helped in our fight against
 HIV/Aids by a lot of the international community - UNAIDS, the
 Gates Foundation, the Merck Campaign Foundation and information
 is being exchanged freely left and right. But we are small country
 with a very small pool of scientists. But a great many scientists
 from abroad are working on the problem here. In fact right now
 tests of a vaccine are taking place. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
 On this issue of leadership then, let me read
 you out an e-mail we've received from Yahya Mohamed in the United
 States. Yahya says: What has motivated you in the fight against
 Aids as your neighbour, Mr Mbeki, president of South Africa,
 denies the veracity of Aids? Clearly there is an issue in South
 Africa about it but do you take any notice of that, do you take
 any influence from that? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
 No, the President of South Africa has
 his views and has his advisors. It's a much bigger country with
 a much larger pool of professionals and he has a great deal
 of professional advice at his disposal, which I don't have.
 And here the evidence of the existence of Aids is apparent for
 all to see and therefore I would be stating the obvious. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
Do you think he's wrong? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
No I don't know. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
Okay let's take another call then from Reginal
 Mpolokeng in Accra, Ghana. Reginal, what's your question to
 President Mogae? 

<p>
Reginal Mpolokeng: 
 Mr President, I really want to applaud
 you for the great work that you are doing to combat the Aids
 scourge in Botswana. My question is focussed on pregnant women.
 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
I think the line is breaking up from Accra.
 But I think the point he was making was about ARVs - antiretrovirals
 - being available for pregnant women, and also the issue of
 compulsory testing - is it compulsory for pregnant women in
 this country to be tested? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
 No it's not. We have an organisation,
 a multi-sectoral committee, called the National Aids Council
 which I chair and it has sub-committees. One sub-committee is
 on men - the men sub-committee - because of the feeling, as
 somebody alleged earlier on, is that the men are responsible
 for the spread of the disease. So we have a sub-committee of
 men on Aids. What they should be doing as fathers and as husbands
 and brothers and just as free agents. That's one. 

<p> Now we also have a law and ethics committee - everything we
 do has to be subjected to a debate by the law and ethics committee.
 We have decided that to make the testing for HIV routine in
 medical facilities. But we can't make it compulsory because
 the advice of the law and ethics committee is that that would
 be a violation of the constitution and a violation of people's
 human rights. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
 But some people might say that in the instance
 of a pregnant woman, there's another individual whose human
 rights are at stake which is the unborn child. Do they not have
 the right to see if the mother is HIV positive and then get
 the necessary treatment that might stop them perhaps having
 HIV? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
 Yes but they will say that the woman
 who is expecting is the person with whom we can communicate
 and it will be she we will be forcing either to test or to undergo
 ARV therapy. So the testing is going to be routine from the
 1st of January, unless the person opts out but it is not compulsory.
 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
Let me read you out an e-mail we've received
 from Gunnar Zachrisen in Norway. Gunnar says: Do you consider
 the UNAIDS estimates to be exaggerated because from national
 samples the pregnant women, for example, seem to give a lower
 level of HIV infection compared to the UN estimates? Do you
 think that there is a discrepancy? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
 Yes there is consistently a discrepancy.
 The UN give a higher figure. We don't want to argue about the
 levels because supposing it's 50, it's too high, it's 25, it's
 too high, they said 35, it's too high, it's 45, it's too high.
 Therefore, we think the debate about statistics will be sterile.
 The problem is that HIV/Aids cuts across everything that we
 are trying to do as a nation, as a small nation. Before the
 advent of the epidemic we had attained human development indices
 that were quite impressive. Things like social indicators, like
 life expectancy, like the infant mortality, the mortality of
 under fives, mortality and morbidity. All of these indicators
 were very favourable, they were going down, now they are being
 reversed by HIV/Aids and therefore whatever - whether it's 25
 or 30 it doesn't matter. 

<p> But the research is there. We have surveys on which we rely.
 The women are attending antenatal clinics. We persuade them
 to test and we take these surveys and they indicate the percentages.
 But if somebody else, some other - as I said there are various
 groups here doing research - if somebody else receives a different
 figure really what you gain by arguing that's not right, it's
 22% not 33 or not 30? Do you have the order of magnitude? 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
 Let's take another call now from Umaru Fofana
 in Sierra Leone. Umaru what's your question for President Mogae?
 

<p>
Umaru Fofana: 
Hi, good afternoon Roger, good afternoon Your
 Excellency. One thing that we have come to know lately is the
 fact that politicians most often are accused of making promises
 or just paying lip services to issues that are affecting various
 people of various countries. In this regard several governments,
 or some governments, have actually come forward in this fight
 against HIV/Aids and one thing which has been known to be a
 fine way of tackling the disease is by knowing each other's
 HIV status. 

<p> Would it be a good idea, Mr President, do you think, if government
 officials, particularly the president and ministers, come out
 publicly and undergo an HIV/Aids test, thereby encouraging their
 people to come forward and carry out the test themselves? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
That has been happening. For instance
 here it has been happening recently but whether it will have
 the impact we don't know. But I think it's a good thing for
 people to test. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
 Do you think it will actually make a difference
 if public figures do that? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
I don't know whether it will or not.
 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
 Okay, Umaru why do you think it would make
 such a big difference, we've been talking about the importance
 of leadership, do you really think it would make a big difference?
 

<p>
Umaru Fofana: 
 Absolutely, I think it would make a big difference
 and I think one reason for the success in the fight against
 HIV/Aids in Uganda is the fact that President Museveni underwent
 a public HIV/Aids test. He instilled confidence in his people
 to know the need for them to undergo the test. I feel when somebody
 knows their HIV status it certainly puts them on a better footing
 to be able to fight against the virus. But if the public figures
 themselves come out and undergo the test it's kind of like instils
 confidence in the people who will not come forward and undergo
 the test themselves. 

<p> But if leaders keep telling people that knowing your HIV status
 is good for our fight against the virus without they themselves
 undergoing the test it makes the whole thing absurd. And I certainly
 for one - I'm a journalist myself, involved with public programmes
 in Sierra Leone, and I happen to know that senior medical doctors
 have never undergone the HIV/Aids test themselves. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
Umaru let's bring the President back in. 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
 Okay maybe the doctors have not but
 I have undergone the test and announced the result and so presumably
 everybody's going to test now that I have tested and announced.
 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
 We will see, thanks very much indeed Umaru
 for that call. Let's go now to Joe Ntenwi in Salt Lake City
 in the United States. Joe what's your question to President
 Mogae? 

<p>
Joe Ntenwi: 
 Mr President I'm so honoured to speak with you.
 I salute your mission and your leadership in the nation and
 history of Botswana. To know as well as I do sir that when you,
 as President, George W. Bush delivered his State of the Nation
 address to the nation and Congress here on Tuesday January 29th
 2003 he amongst things said: "I ask Congress to commit $15 billion
 over the next five years. Ten billion dollars in new money to
 turn the tide against Aids in most nations in Africa and the
 Caribbean." 

<p> I guess my question to you is that is very a year on what on,
 what part of this money has your government received from the
 Bush administration to help prevent new Aids infections and
 provide human care for people suffering from the disease? Is
 this presumptuous of me sir to think that the Bush administration's
 pledge is nothing but superpower cynicism and wickedly unfunny
 rhetoric? 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
Ok Joe, let's put that to President Mogae. What
 money have you seen? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
Well two things. I think we must be
 familiar with the United States system. What has happened is
 that the President with the consent of the Congress has announced
 his intention to allocate $10 billion in additional money over
 the next five years. What has now to happen is that he's going
 to have to seek to appropriate that money and then Congress
 is going to debate and want to know how it's going to be used,
 how much will go to what country and so on. And it's still going
 to be a big fight. That is what happens as we know in the United
 States. 

<p> But in any case with any government there is the first the announcement
 or the intention of the administration to do something, and
 then there has to be parliamentary appropriation. But regarding
 Botswana, well he says that the $10 billion will be new money.
 I am told that the $5 billion is part of the billions that has
 gone to the Global Fund already. And in return we are already
 in receipt of some money in the sense that, not out of that
 money, the new money, but out of old money. We have been helped
 to establish 16 voluntary testing and counselling centres they
 provided us. We built them or we bought houses with that money
 and they provided the kits and they trained our people, they
 provided the kits - the testing kits - and the alternative methods
 and so on and they provided two doctors who are supervising
 that whole programme. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
But in terms of the American money which we
 were speaking about? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
 That's the American money I'm talking
 about. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
 But the money that was pledged by President
 Bush hasn't arrived, do you expect it to arrive any time soon?
 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
No I know the procedure in the United
 States is going to take a long time for it to be appropriated.
 Assuming Congress then approves it. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
 So you're not completely sure that it will
 actually arrive in the end at all? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
Yes it might not because there are other
 priorities for the American nation. But I think the President
 intended to do it and he will. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
You think it should be a priority? 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
Well how can I determine other nations
 priorities? But I am just grateful for the assistance, the assistance
 to us has been generous. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
 Mr President let's take one more call now.
 Tazz Kajila is on the line from South Africa, Tazz what's your
 question to President Mogae? 

<p>
Tazz Kajila:
Good afternoon. Well mine is not really a question.
 I really want to say I appreciate President Mogae for what his
 government is doing to fight Aids and also all the governments
 in Southern Africa. What I wanted to say is that governments
 can only do that much. People's attitudes towards Aids needs
 to change because what I see here in South Africa and Zambia,
 which is my home country, that people are not scared of Aids.
 They see adverts and they read papers and everything but their
 behaviour towards sex and it's just not right and it's like
 they're not afraid of Aids or anything. So I'm saying all the
 government fighting Aids and everything, they're doing their
 best and people also need to really show that they're also doing
 their part. But what we've seen here in Africa is a different
 story, thank you. 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
 Let me get a response to that from President
 Mogae, how do you respond to that? Obviously a different situation
 in South Africa but similar in many ways. 

<p>
President Festus Mogae:
 Well I think the government can use
 its best endeavours to help, to inform and to the extent that
 it is able to provide assistance, certainly with orphans and
 certainly with antiretroviral therapy to the extent that the
 budgetary situation permits. But also preach change, even if
 people don't change at least they can't say they don't know.
 

<p>
Roger Hearing: 
 President Mogae thank you very much indeed
 for that. That's all we have time for today from Botswana. So
 my thanks to our guest President Festus Mogae, President of
 Botswana and of course to all of you who've taken part in this
 programme. If you want to contribute to the debate and to the
 ongoing debate at the moment about Aids you can go to our website:
 bbcnews.com/aids. But that's all from us at Talking Point, from
 all of us here on the team goodbye.
