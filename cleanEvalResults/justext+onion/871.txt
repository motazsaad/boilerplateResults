<h>Faldo reaches end of Open road

<h>By Matt Slater
 BBC Sport at St Andrews

<p>Jack Nicklaus was adamant this week would not turn into a two-day
 farewell parade. He came to the 134th Open Championship "as
 a contender, not a monument".

<p> And the competitive fire that helped win him 18 majors did not
 stop burning until he bogeyed the 17th and saw his chance of
 making the cut finally disappear. 

<p> "Faldo's days as a potential winner have gone" It was then,
 and only then, that Nicklaus dropped his guard and allowed himself
 to enjoy his valedictory championship hole. 

<p> Nick Faldo, another three-time Open champion, will know how
 his hero is feeling today. 

<p> The Englishman, 48 on Monday, has Nicklaus' battling instincts
 - and during his pomp he also had the Golden Bear's unflinching
 putting stroke. 

<p> The fire still burns in Faldo, but the spark with the flat stick
 has gone out. 

<p> Watching the six-time major winner from tee to green, it is
 possible to imagine a seventh big prize is not beyond him. 

<p> After all, a 46-year-old Nicklaus did it at the Masters in 1986.
 

<p> But the Golden Bear still knew his "bread and butter" then.
 Faldo has lost all contact with his. 

<p> In many ways, his efforts this week have mirrored those of Nicklaus.
 

<p> Friday's scenes would have to have been postponed if the American
 had been able to hole a few putts. 

<p> Faldo took 34 putts on Thursday, 30 on Friday and 31 on Saturday.
 That's 31.7 putts per round - about three more than an Open
 champion would expect to take. 

<p>
 And what those numbers don't show is how many of those 31.7
 putts per round were 15-footers that used to drop but now refuse
 to co-operate. 

<p> Having started his round on one under, the 1990 champion here
 looked in good touch after a birdie at the long fifth that took
 him to three under. 

<p> But then reasonable birdie opportunities were spurned at six,
 seven and eight. 

<p> He had to play backwards out of a fairway bunker on the ninth,
 but this time his putter played ball and par was saved. 

<p> Sadly, the return of his putting stroke was temporary as very
 makeable birdie chances went begging on 10 and 11. 

<p> By now the body language was starting to scream "?&*Â£!". Having
 reached the fringe at the 12th, he needed three raps of his
 misfiring putter to finish the job. It was head in hands time.
 

<p> The worse his putting got, the longer the pre-putt routine became.
 The only angle Faldo wasn't checking could only have been provided
 by the Royal Bank of Scotland blimp. 

<p> But despite - or perhaps because of - these navigational aids,
 Faldo's ball continued to show all the homing instincts of a
 teenager at a great party. 

<p> Meanwhile, Faldo's playing partner, Darren Clarke, was having
 an erratic day on the dance floor. 

<p> The 36-year-old Ulsterman was almost as bad on the greens as
 Faldo on the first two days, but on Saturday improved to 27
 putts. 

<p> Faldo, however, did not miss anything as short as Clarke did
 on the 11th - an 18-inch tiddler stayed up to bring a second
 straight bogey for the Northern Irish star. 

<p> At that point it looked as though the red mists would roll in
 and engulf Clarke. 

<p> He had birdied four straight from the fifth to reach five under
 and then saved a superb par after a penalty drop at the ninth.
 But the bogeys threatened to wreck all that good work. 

<p> Thankfully, Clarke's mood is less connected to his golf these
 days, and an enormous drive and two putts at the 12th got his
 momentum going forward again. 

<p> It got even better at the next. Having spent the first two days
 bemoaning his prodigal putter, Clarke sank a roller-coaster
 from 20 yards for birdie. 

<p> Even Faldo got excited about that one, although the smile disappeared
 when his six-foot par putt stayed above ground. 

<p> The next four holes brought a further birdie for Clarke and
 anguish for Faldo, who had now started contorting his body into
 unusual yoga shapes between shots. 

<p> But the Englishman had the last laugh, well, smile. Both players
 drove the 18th green but only Faldo could cross the huge putting
 surface in two shots for birdie. 

<p> That left him on three under, three behind Clarke and eight
 off Woods' overnight lead. 

<p> Most almost-48-year-olds would be more than happy to be able
 to say the same, but Faldo isn't most almost-48-year-olds. 

<p> Just as Nicklaus only came to St Andrews because he thought
 he could play four competitive rounds, Faldo only plays because
 he still thinks he can win. 

<p> But while it is difficult to imagine Faldo ever agreeing to
 a ceremonial role, his days as a potential winner have gone.
 The reassessment of pre-event goals may be a tricky one for
 this most competitive of sportsmen.
