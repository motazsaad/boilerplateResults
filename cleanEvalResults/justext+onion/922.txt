<p>The Hermitage Shop wants to make your shopping experience as
 enjoyable as possible. Links to information about the site and
 our policies are provided below. If you need additional assistance,
 please contact Customer service.

<p>
 In order to make your ordering process easier, we've listed
 our addressing guidelines here:

<l>We can not ship to PO Boxes

<l>APO/FPO: For APO or FPO addresses, please enter APO or FPO in
 the City field and select one of the following in the State
 field: Armed Forces Europe (includes Middle East, Africa, and
 Canada); Armed Forces Americas; or Armed Forces Pacific. Also
 make sure that you have selected U.S.A. in the Country field.

<l>US Territories: The US territories can be found in the State/Prov/Terr
 drop down box.

<l>Canadian Provinces: The Canadian provinces can be found in the
 State/Prov/Terr drop down box.

<p>
 Entrance tickets to the Hermitage can be purchased over the
 Internet on the Tickets page of the shop website. Purchasing
 Hermitage tickets online allows the visitor to perform the transaction
 using a credit card and avoid standing in line at the museum
 ticket office. 

<p>How to purchase tickets
 Tickets can be purchased on the Tickets
 page of the shop's website. 
 While placing the order you will
 be asked to type in some information: your name, type and quantity
 of tickets, e-mail address, and credit card information. You
 will receive a confirmation, as well as the Ticket Vouchers,
 via the e-mail address that you provide to us, so it is very
 important that all of the information you entered is valid and
 correct. 

<p>If you wish to buy two different types of tickets, you should
 place a separate order. 

<p>Once you place your order through the website, you will receive
 an automated confirmation email, acknowledging that your order
 was received. If you did not receive this immediate confirmation
 email, containing your order number, it is mostly likely due
 to either an incorrect email address being provided or your
 email program blocking the sender (us).

<p>In one to three days after the order is placed and payment is
 verified, you will receive another e-mail, this time containing
 the Ticket Voucher (proof of purchase) in an attached PDF file.
 You might want to turn off your SPAM/junk filter, during the
 time you are waiting to receive our email, since your mail server
 may block these emails or put them to the SPAM/junk folder.
 You should contact our Customer Service on the 4th day if you
 still have not received your Voucher.

<p>Note: In order to view and print PDF files, you will need to
 download a free copy of Adobe Acrobat Reader. To open an Acrobat
 Reader file (a PDF file), double-click on it.

<p>The Order change and Order cancellation policy applies to ticket
 sales. Unused Vouchers are refundable upon cancellation (less
 Processing Service Fee). 

<p>A nonrefundable Processing Service Fee $3.95 applies per each
 Ticket sold. 

<p>There are certain categories of visitors who are eligible for
 a free admission. You can find information about this below
 in the section entitled "Eligible for a free admission".

<p>The online Hermitage Shop makes every effort to ensure that all
 of the transactions made on the shop.hermitagemuseum.org website
 are secure. All credit card numbers submitted to the site are
 encrypted using "Secure Socket Layer" (SSL) encryption, which
 is the industry standard for information security and is used

 the server hosting the website within a few hours of the time
 the order is placed. We will retain your order information for
 our records, but this information will never be sold or shared
 with others.

<p>Shipping and handling costs are calculated based on the weight
 of the items being shipped, including the packing material.
 An insurance charge will be added to all orders with a value
 higher than $100 (including S &amp; H). A $2.50 flat rate insurance
 charge is applied to all orders with a value between $100 and
 $500. An additional $0.50 insurance charge will be applied for
 every $100 or fraction thereof over $500 of order value.

<p>Deliveries to continental US. The buyer can select one of three
 delivery services: regular ground service (usually delivered

 The website will calculate the total shipping and handling cost
 and will include it into the total charge of the order.

<p>Deliveries to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Only the 'second
 day express' level of service is offered for these orders. The
 website will calculate the total shipping and handling cost
 and will include it into the total charge of the order.

 e-mail.

<p>Delivery is available to street addresses only. We are not able
 to deliver to post office boxes. 

<p>Special order items are products that are not kept in stock but
 are custom made upon a customer order. Examples of special order
 products are handmade copies of paintings and furniture (these
 offerings may not be available at all times). These products
 will be displayed as part of the catalog, but cannot be ordered
 via the website. To order these products, please contact Customer
 Service. Please note that special order items can be paid by
 check or money order only.

<p>Most special order products require extensive time for delivery,
 usually several weeks (more detailed information is available
 in the catalog). When placing a special order the customer will
 be asked to make an advanced payment, usually 30% of the total
 product price. Once the product is ready for shipping, the customer
 will be informed via phone or e-mail and will be requested to
 settle the balance of the order. Product shipment will take
 place after this second payment is verified.

<p>The refunds or cancellation policy of special orders is the following:

<l>Changes or cancellations will be accepted at no charge until
 the request to manufacture the item is placed with the original
 item manufacturer. 

<l>After the special order has been placed with the product manufacturer,
 a cancellation will result in the customer losing his/her advance
 payment. Special order changes will be accepted at our discretion,
 possibly for an additional charge. 

<l> After the final payment, no refunds or order cancellation will
 be accepted on special orders. 

<p>With the exception of our 5 days return policy, any other warranty
 against defects on materials or workmanship, when available,
 will be provided by the respective manufacturers only. Please
 contact Customer Service for any additional information or manufacturer
 addresses.
