<h>News and musings on how we communicate in the online age

<p>Often, when I&#8217;m coaching writers (yes, I offer that as
 a professional service, ask me about coaching), I have to battle
 the &#8220;trapped at the keyboard&#8221; mindset &#8211; that
 is, the idea that the act of writing involves only what happens
 while you&#8217;re typing. In fact, clear thinking is the most
 important (and most often overlooked) aspect of good writing.

<p>Clear thoughts crystallize in &#8220;Aha!&#8221; moments. An
 &#8220;Aha!&#8221; moment occurs when you realize that you have
 grasped a key concept, event, or relationship in such a way
 that you know exactly what you must communicate, or at least
 how to start.

<p>Often, this won&#8217;t happen when you&#8217;re sitting there,
 stubbornly willing yourself to write. In fact, staring at the
 computer screen is exactly how many potentially good writers
 end up wasting a lot of time and energy, while undermining their
 efforts with frustration and despair!

<p>All writing, even business or academic writing, is a creative
 process. It pays to discover your own creative style and nuances.
 Here&#8217;s how you can learn which circumstances or activities
 yield the most “Aha! moments” for you&#8230;WHAT CAUSES YOUR
 &#8220;AHA!&#8221; MOMENTS?

<p>Try this:

<l>Find your best bits of writing: Consider your current writing
 project, or one you&#8217;ve worked on recently. Which parts
 of that writing &#8220;work&#8221; best? That is, what sentences,
 phrases, headings, or paragraphs get your point across most
 effectively and engagingly?

<l>Where and when did you get those great ideas? For each great
 bit of writing, think back: Exactly when or where did you first
 think to present that particular bit of information in that
 way? Be honest, and note everything you can recall about the
 circumstances. What were you doing, how were you feeling, what
 kind of environment were you in, and what had you been doing
 in the hours and minutes prior to that idea springing forth?

<l>Look for patterns: This might be easy. If the truth is that most
 of your best ideas spring from your subconscious while you zone
 out on the subway during your daily commute, honor that. If
 you never do any decent writing before noon, that&#8217;s very
 important information.

<l>If an obvious pattern is hard to spot: Consider your physical,
 mental, or emotional state at the time of your &#8220;Aha!&#8221;
 moment. Had you recently exercised, eaten, or slept? Did you
 get an ego boost earlier that day? Did you work on crossword
 puzzles over your morning coffee? Did you have a really great
 conversation, or read a thought-provoking weblog entry? Also
 consider whether distracting, irritating, or unnerving factors
 were mercifully absent: Was traffic not so bad that morning?
 Was your boss out sick? 

<p>MAKE MORE &#8220;AHA!&#8221; MOMENTS HAPPEN

<p>Do what works for you, on a regular basis. 

<p>If you find you get the most &#8220;Aha!&#8221; moments while
 sitting quietly at a conference, listening intently to the Q&#038;A
 sessions at the end of panel discussions, then make an effort
 to attend a conference (or at least a brown-bag lunch) just
 before you start writing.

<p>If the buzzing computers and ringing phones gnaw away at your
 ability to concentrate, consider doing your initial writing
 in a quiet place, maybe brainstorming with a paper notebook,
 just scribbling down key phrases, outlining concepts. Or maybe
 just don earplugs or headphones to get started.

<p>If you need to talk things over with colleagues or friends, let
 them know that that this is a productive part of your writing
 process. Find ways to make more time for discussion that works
 well for all concerned.

<p>If you need to play tennis or go for a walk, dance the tango
 or climb a tree, do it. Just make sure that whatever you&#8217;re
 doing to enhance your creativity doesn&#8217;t just end up becoming
 a procrastination tactic. 

<p>TAKE NOTES!

<p>All those &#8220;Aha!&#8221; moments will do your writing no
 good whatsoever if you don&#8217;t capture them. The trick is
 to capture those thoughts without interrupting the creative
 process.

<p>Most writers I know find memory alone to be highly unreliable.
 Choose a good tool that you&#8217;re comfortable with &#8211;
 a notepad and pen, whiteboard, transcript from an online chat
 discussion, or (my tool of choice) a digital voice recorder.

<p>The point is not to create a verbatim account, but rather to
 capture the cool stuff. When something you need to say becomes
 clear to you, it&#8217;s exciting. So if you find yourself getting
 a bit excited, that&#8217;s good! Chances are that whatever
 excites you will later grab your audience&#8217;s attention,
 too.

<p>This kind of note-taking is all about emphasizing clarity, so
 be emphatic in your notes. Use exclamation points, circle or
 underline things. For instance, when I talk into my voice recorder,
 I say, &#8220;Yeah! Yeah!&#8221; a lot, and my voice takes on
 a very animated tone. People in the grocery store find this
 quite amusing.

<p>BRING IT BACK TO YOUR WRITING

<p>Once you have noted even just a few &#8220;Aha!&#8221; moments,
 start from those. It doesn&#8217;t matter if they&#8217;re points
 you&#8217;ll make at the beginning, middle, or end of your document.
 Just get the words flowing. It&#8217;s OK to jump around, to
 ignore your outline, whatever you want. Just get that energy
 flowing.

<p>My only caution is to keep an eye on scope and length. Don&#8217;t
 fritter away your writing energy by flying off into interesting
 tangents that you know won&#8217;t make it into your final document.
 (But do note those tangents, they may be fodder for future writing.)
 Don&#8217;t write 5,000 words if you know your audience will
 only spend a minute or two with your document. Get to the point,
 and stick to the point.

<p>&#8230;So, if you&#8217;re feeling stymied or frustrated or bored
 with your writing, chances are the real problems began long
 before you sat down at your computer. Look at the big picture,
 and consider what really makes your mind focus and produce those
 gems. You may be surprised. 

<l>I enjoyed your article on &#8220;aha&#8221; moments. I&#8217;ve
 found it&#8217;s vital to get these precious thoughts down when
 they come to you, or they&#8217;ll be gone as surely as a puff
 of smoke.

<l>I have a method that some of your readers might like to try.
 A lot of these thoughts come to me while I&#8217;m in bed, getting
 ready to go to sleep. I keep a tape recorder next to my bed
 on a stand. It has a corded microphone attached to it with an
 off-on button. The recorder is always set to record; in other
 words, all I have to do is click the microphone button to on
 and it&#8217;s recording. When I have an idea or thought I don&#8217;t
 want to lose, I record it right then. It&#8217;s easy to do
 in the dark. And it&#8217;s there the next morning when you
 need it.

<l>I liked your suggestions&#8230;and discovered, as I&#8217;m mainly
 a teacher and teacher trainer, not strictly a writer, that my
 best Aha moments are those in which I get the &#8216;big picture&#8217;
 of my work in progress with other people learning, sharing ideas
 and &#8216;constructing&#8217;.
