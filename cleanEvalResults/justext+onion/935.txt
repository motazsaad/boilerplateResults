<h>Friday Ark

<p>I'll post links to sites that have Friday (plus or minus a few
 days) photos of their chosen animals as I see them (photoshops
 at my discretion and humans only in supporting roles).

<p>Leave a comment or trackback to this post or email me and I'll
 add yours to the list. Check back regularly for updates throughout
 the day on Fridays and somewhat less frequently over the weekend.

<p>Dog folks: remember to submit your links to the Carnival of the
 Dogs hosted by Mickey's Musings.

<p>Cat folks: remember to submit your links to the Carnival of the
 Cats which goes up every Sunday and will be hosted this week
 by Running Scared.

<p>And, check out Laurence's fine graphical analysis of Friday Ark
 boardings.

<p>We have seven photos of invertebrates. We just couldn't decide
 which one to send. One photo is of a sea cucumber that we just
 took on Wednesday. http://newdharmabums.blogspot.com/2005/04/invertebrates-dead-and-alive.html

<p>Since there are no decent pictures available of our newest avian
 celebrity, the ivory-billed woodpecker, would you settle for
 an illustration by the great John James Audubon himself?

<p>We have some recently hatched Polyphemus moth caterpillars being
 raised. Photos of hatching (4/24/05 post) and week-old babies
 (4/26 post) currently posted. Sorry it's Sunday! If I may I'll
 try to get a new update photo next Friday?
