<h>Gorgo, Mormo, thousand-faced moon, look favorably on our posts!

<h>The evidence

<l>Hal Duncan: Vellum : The Book of All Hours
Incredibly audacious
 debut novel blending science-fiction and fantasy in a compelling
 universe which allows Duncan to examine the nature of storytelling
 and myth. (*****)

<l>Carol O'Connell: Dead Famous
Detective Kathleen Mallory must
 find out who's murdering jurors in a controversial murder trial,
 while keeping her adoptive father Riker alive. (***)

<l>K. J. Bishop: The Etched City
For want of a better name, call
 it urban grotesque. Wickedly imaginative. (***)

<l>Neal Asher: Gridlinked
Violent science-fiction thriller with
 a laconic sense of humor. Britnoir in a head-on collision with
 space opera. (***)

<l>ALEXANDER IRVINE: One King, One Soldier
A book with the Holy
 Grail and Templars and I STILL loved it. For my money the best
 parts are set in Africa, but a worthy successor to SCATTERING
 OF JADES. (****)

<l>JOHN BURDETT: Bangkok 8 : A Novel (Vintage)
Murder mystery (after
 a fashion) set in Thailand. Burdett does a nice job of subverting
 the reader's expectations. (****)

<l>John C. Wright: The Golden Age (The Golden Age)
Well-written
 thought-provoking novel of a posthuman Solar System. AND it
 has armored penguins. (****)

<l>Alexander Besher: Chi
Enjoyable more for the ride than the characters
 or plot. Chi bootlegging, chlorophyll-based search engines,
 primate-based Internets are some of the ideas Besher tosses
 out. (***)

<l>Richard Paul Russo: Carlucci
Downbeat SF/mystery trilogy about
 a cop in near-future San Francisco. (****)

<l>Duncan J. Watts: Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age
Fascinating
 as much for the process Watts goes through of formulating his
 hypotheses as for his findings. (****)

<h>Christmas Update

<p>Christmas is my least favorite time of the year, honestly, which
 is why I generally try to spend it elsewhere. But I foolishly
 thought I could make great strides in cleaning up my apartment,
 so I turned down the offer to visit my parents.

<p>SPECTRE has given us Christmas and the day after off, so I've
 got a four-day weekend.

<p>Friday night: Worked till 7:30 PM, went home, worked some more
 on another project, finished off Call of Cthulhu-related draft
 and sent to the shadowy Mr. Harms, watched R.O.D. - Read or
 Die (thanks, Laurel!). Politely turned down offer from parents
 to visit, who did not seem pleased, or interested in counteroffer
 that they could come up to visit.

<p>Saturday: Lazed around the house, doing nothing useful. Unless
 hanging out on IRC or Second Life has a higher purpose I'm unaware
 of. Discovered that a drink of equal part cranberry juice cocktail
 and Ketel One isn't entirely suckworthy. Played some with a
 word processor for OS X, Mellel - seems promising, once I figure
 out tables of contents and how to make text flow. The application
 and documents open much faster than Word. Found out a friend
 has diabetes. 

<p>Sunday: Packed up one bag of books, which I brought to the local
 church. Could have brought another, but decided not to. Continued
 lazing policy. Talked with Bryan briefly.

<p>Monday: Packed up bag full of books again, though I'm not sure
 why since I can't drop them off anywhere unless Symposium Books
 in Hoboken is open on Tuesday. Did more work on project for
 SPECTRE, noted questions for researcher, tried to check work
 e-mail only to find I'm locked out because it's been too long
 since I changed my password. Or something. Again, lazed. 

<p>In ultimate sad commentary on Western civilization, watched a
 movie on a TV inside Second Life (Panic in the City) and picked
 up a free TV for the plot of land I bought. Looked for Civ IV
 disk, since the stupid copy protection scheme requires you to
 put in the disk each time you want to play, with no success.
 Research continues. Meanwhile, looking through various tutorials
 for Mellel.

<p>Tuesday will likely be when I do everything I should have done
 Saturday, Sunday and Monday - pick up antidepressants, see if
 I can get my beard trimmed, go through clothes/do laundry, drop
 off box of books for acquaintance in Texas and pick up more
 boxes for books to ship to Lee.

<h>December 24, 2006

<h>Save me from old fogeydom!

<p>So I'm going through my iTunes Library and sorting by year, and
 as far as I can tell I'm trapped in a time bubble which lets
 almost no music from 2004 or later through. I'm leaving out
 mashups, newly released but ancient albums, and older songs
 on recent albums. Here's what I've got from 2004 on:

<p>I've checked out Arcade Fire, Franz Ferdinand, the Hives, the
 Killers, the Strokes and the White Stripes and as far as I can
 tell all the bands the kids like are engaged in a race to the
 bottom between neoteny and necrophilia. I reserve the right
 to change my mind about Metric. Are there current bands which
 don't suck?

<h>December 20, 2006

<h>Look, I'm not making the billions joke

<p>When I was a kid, I knew that of course I was going to be a scientist.
 Probably a chemist, since both of my parents were chemists,
 but physics was neat too. I had a regular subscription to Natural
 History (still remember the article on the discovery of Charon),
 and my two "science heroes" were Stephen Jay Gould and Carl
 Sagan.

<p>Sadly, my skill (or lack of it, rather) in the lab doomed my
 chemistry career, even though my high school teacher praised
 my grasp of theory. An inability to grasp basic concepts like
 vectors similarly put the kibosh on physics. But I still have
 a love for and appreciation of science, and a lot of that I
 owe to Carl Sagan.

<p>Other science writers I've enjoyed, though few of them have Sagan's
 range:

<h>A great miracle happened here

<p>So I've missed the actual menorah lighting ceremony, but I came
 across a synagogue in the virtual enviroment Second Life, Temple
 Beth Israel. It's certainly an odd experience, waiting for your
 house of prayer to rez.

<p>Several menorahs of various sizes, self-spinning dreidel animations,
 as well as the traditional bimah, Torahs and Eternal Flame.
 I lucked upon the founder, Beth Odets, who talked about the
 difficulties of having a synagogue in a setting where you couldn't
 rely on people being around for very long. There's a profile
 of Beth and the synagogue here.

<p>You can have music and movies automatically playing in Second
 Life locations - the former was the case here, as various Hebrew
 songs played. There's a group for the synagogue which gets notified
 of events, which I signed up for.

<p>What does religion mean in a virtual setting? One can certainly
 have community and ritual, but can one experience God in an
 online simulation?

<p>There's a 2003 article, "The Function of Religion in Massive
 Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Games," available here. It focuses
 on the community and social mores aspects, however. This holds
 true for this article and this paper "The Sacred and the Virtual
 World: Religion in Multi-User Virtual Reality. Terra Nova's
 Religion in MMOGs at least briefly touches on the issue.

<p>I asked a Muslim IRC acquaintance about prayer in Second Life
 and he seemed to think Second Life was a worthless distraction
 and the question was irrelevant since people are not limited
 to having avatars in SL. I asked him if all spirituality was
 irrelevant in the context of virtual communities, and he had
 this to say:

<p>it can be a place to discuss it, but your mistake is in thinking
 that virtual communities are truly disembodied
Spiritually speaking,
 SL is (in most cases) a distraction from the concerns of real
 spirituality

<p>I think I shall go on a journey to understand religious worship
 and practices in Second Life.

<h>No-prize to whoever gets the reference

<l>In order to move, I need to have everything in my apartment cleaned
 up.

<l>Everything in my apartment can be classified into stuff to sell/throw
 out/donate or stuff to keep/box up.

<p>Therefore, I should be able to clean the apartment and move in
 a month. Evidence: I did it before when I was living in Somerville.
 Tim and Lee managed to do it, dealing with The Incredibly Large
 Apartment. So what about my lease? My hypothesis: I should be
 able to move, assuming movers cooperate, early February. I doubt
 I'd be able to get my security deposit back in any event, and
 I'd only be moving out one month before my lease expired end
 of March, so I doubt there'd be much of a penalty.

<h>A new blog for me!

<p>Thanks to Catherine Lavall√©e-Welch and Jill Hurst-Wahl of SLA's
 Information Technology Division Blogging Section, I am now an
 author on the Blogging Section's blog (about blogging). It's
 all terribly recursive, I know, but I'm grateful to Catherine
 and Jill for the opportunity to contribute to SLA and to the
 profession!

<h>Phonogram - Buy It

<p>I haven't been picking up comics for a while - trying to cut
 down on crap in case I'm able to move.

<p>I'd noted the announcements of Phonogram with interest on The
 Engine, but I was nervous that I didn't know much about Britpop.
 I mean sure, I knew Oasis, Blur, Elastica, but I was never that
 into the whole Britpop scene and I was worried I wouldn't get
 any of the references. Sean Demory, the unheralded Axis Mundi
 of the blogoweb and the man who stole fire from the gods and
 brought it to LiveJournal, reassured me on that score, and I
 decided to pick up the first three issues. Sadly, by this point
 only the latest was available, but it's a good jumping-on point.
 Also, sales are strong enough that there will be a trade, though
 I don't know how much of the explanatory back-matter will be
 included. For example, the cover of #3 is apparently a riff
 on the cover of Oasis' Definitely Maybe, and the title of the
 issue is from a Manic Street Preachers single.

<p>The premise is simple - music is literally magic. Kieron Gillen
 and the disturbingly-sideburned Jamie McKelvie take this premise
 and are looking at Britpop through that lens. David Kohl is
 a phonomancer and a complete bastard, someone who can tap the
 power of music, and someone's messing with his reality. So he
 goes around trying to find out who. The art's a deceptively-simple,
 clean-looking black-and-white with fine lines. The page layouts
 are interesting, from the seven panel grid driving to London
 to the six vertical panel grid of Emily Aster to the transformation
 David Kohl undergoes in a set of 8 panel grids culminating in
 a huge panel dominating a four-panel grid.

<p>Note to self - re-read Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art
 so I can actually say something sensible about comics composition
 rather than sounding like a complete prat.

<p>I have no freakin' idea who the Manic Street Preachers, Kenickie,
 Shed Seven, etc. are, and I wasn't that heavy a club-goer, but
 I can substitute bands I do know and some things are universals
 - David Kohl channeling the Britpop 90s reminds me of stomping
 around on the dance floor after Skinny Puppy at St. Andrews
 Hall (the Last Rites Tour, uneasily shuttling between Sarah-Marie
 and Sean and Bryan and Ceredwyn) or moshing to Cop Shoot Cop
 at the Middle East (1995? The ticket-taker looked oddly like
 Laurel).

<p>For gaming people - imagine Unknown Armies if everyone obsessed
 over music rather than trying to live in a James Ellroy novel.
 If you love music at all, you have to pick up this series. And
 make Gillen and McKelvie do more.

<h>Mid-December 2006 update

<p>I haven't gotten as much done as I'd hoped this weekend, but
 I have dropped off a milk crate full of books at the local church,
 I'll be doing laundry tonight and going through clothes to see
 what doesn't fit anymore. Ultimately I need to get rid of a
 room's worth of books or so - that will let me put the computer
 desk and the bookshelf portion of the bookshelf/dresser combo
 (which I should photograph one of these days) into storage and
 get rid of the bed which is falling apart (which also has shelves
 built into the headboard).

<p>To clarify a point on an obstacle to my potential move: offices
 have salary bands, with San Francisco being the most expensive
 U.S. office. If my salary were to increase, that would mean
 I'd be costing the research group more and they'd have to raise
 my rate to recover costs. I'm going to follow up with HR to
 see if that's the case.

<p>I've watched Pulse (Kairo), which I think succeeds more in establishing
 a mood than in terms of characters or plot. It seems that there's
 a promising premise along the lines of urban isolation blurring
 the lines between the living and the dead, but then there's
 a wacky explanation of a grad student's computer game which
 suggests that people getting too close die. The hell? As urban
 overcrowding I could see it, but Kurosawa seems to be going
 for more than that. Any thoughts from Brian or Bryan, both of
 whom I know have seen this?

<h>The bitch is dead

<p>I decided to cheer myself up after a talk with my boss (no no
 no, not The Talk) by seeing Casino Royale at the theater next
 door after work. Conveniently, there was a show in the next
 20 minutes or so.

<p>From the opening black-and-white mission and following animated
 credits sequence, we know this isn't going to be Bond-as-usual.
 Daniel Craig plays Bond as a guided missile, content to point
 himself at a target and cut loose, thinking little beyond that.
 Nowhere is this more clear than in the virtuoso chase sequence,
 with the terrorist sliding, swinging and leaping gracefully
 as Bond barrels through obstacles, feet pounding. The re-imagining
 of Bond as a SAS squaddie fits in with this - he has a Rolex
 because special forces types always go for the best equipment.
 Though he's clearly comfortable in a tux, which suggests some
 refinement.

<p>Credit also goes to Eva Green, the actress playing Vesper Lynd.
 It's clear that she does love Bond, the relationship makes sense
 and is one of equals, unlike other Bond women in the past. I
 love the banter between the two of them.

<p>As with many others, I would have preferred the movie end with
 the classic line showing Bond as the smooth smart predator he's
 become, "The bitch is dead." The extended ending merely serves
 to underline to slower-witted members of the audience that yes,
 Vesper did genuinely love Bond and that Bond's transformation
 into the spy we know is complete.

<p>Interesting bit - I think they're setting up SPECTRE or something
 like it as the antagonist, with the suggestion of an organization
 behind Le Chiffre.

<h>Looking for Clues

<p>Apologies to Robert Palmer haters out there. Anyway, interesting
 discussion on RPG.net of all places about investigation-based
 games, prompted by people getting their hands on The Esoterrorists
 at Dragonmeet, the lucky bastards.

<p>As my PBEM game involves players and characters alike solving
 mysteries great and small, this is a topic of interest to me.
 I tend to plan my games in terms of elements and small arcs
 I want to include, but making up a lot of the details as I go
 along. This is likely less than ideal, but has the advantage
 of ensuring players have an effect on the game world, rather
 than acting out my scripts. I also tend to reduce rolls to when
 I think they'd benefit the game, which is probably a counter-tendency
 towards the 'acting out scripts' end of things. Did it make
 sense to potentially deny Tim's character info on faeries with
 red hair? No, so I just gave the info.

<p>Basically, Esoterrorists assumes the important part of an investigative
 game isn't collecting clues, it's what players and characters
 do with them. 

<p>The meat of the book is to do with a methodology for designing
 and running investigative scenarios. On a first read through,
 it seemed quite similar to how authors typically plot whodunnits.
 Like, figure out who the bad guy was and what he is/was trying
 to do. Figure out what the PCs would need to do to stop it or
 solve it (ie. victory conditions). Then work backwards towards
 clues and note down scene by scene possible investigative locations/scenes,
 each with key clues. There's a well fleshed out example scenario
 that does this in some detail.

<p> I'm not really explaining this brilliantly but the main point
 with the system is that a character doesn't really have to roll
 their investigative skills. If they have the skills and try
 to use them appropriately, they'll get the information. Up to
 them what they do with it. So you avoid the hassle of GM asking
 players to roll to see what they have discovered and having
 to deal with failed rolls that stall the plot/investigation
 (tbh, if most GMs are like me, they'll probably give out the
 info anyway but I like a game that plays to 'what I would want
 to do anyway')

<p>Another poster adds the following:

<p>With investigative abilities you get a basic clue if you have
 the ability and you can spend points to get more. Even if you
 spend all your Pool you still get the basic clues.

<p> With other abilities you spend points, roll a D6 and add, trying
 to match or beat a target number (IIRC in the range of 4-8,
 defaulting to 4).

<p>I really, really dislike the school of GMing which fudges rolls
 so that players never miss clues/are never endangered. Players
 can miss clues in my game. Players can fail. Players can even
 die. On the other hand, I'm giving characters some slack in
 the Morality department, even though it is White Wolf, because
 I feel it's appropriate to the espionage genre. I will give
 accurate information to the players, subject to PC and NPCs'
 agendas, of course. If something seems off in information received,
 there's probably a reason. There are the subplots (characters
 learn more about each other, individual missions) and the larger
 plots (what's Indigo's agenda and who are the other players
 out there?)

<p>I'll be interested in discussion after the first mission to see
 how well things work, and I'll probably pick up The Esoterrorists
 as a guide to future mission and larger arc design.

I like this album a lot more

Goblin is an Italian prog rock
