<h>ANEMIA OVERVIEW

<p> 

<p>1.     Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, dyspnea on exertion,
 and even angina.  Physical exam findings include pallor, tachycardia,
 and jaundice.

<p> 

<p>2.     To generate a differential diagnosis anemia, first categorize
 the type of anemia (microcytic, normocytic, macrocytic) by MCV
 and furthermore with the ferritin and reticulocyte count.  Then,
 exam the peripheral smear: findings on the smear will narrow
 your differential, suggest additional medical problems the patient
 may have (i.e. target cells and liver disease, spur cells and
 uremia with uremic platelet dysfunction), and may reveal diagnoses
 such as microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) in a timely
 fashion.  Finally, order additional tests to confirm your diagnosis
 and remember to get your tests before transfusing the patient.

<p> 

<p>3.     Factoids:

<p>·       Hospitalized patients will drop their hematocrit 1% per
 day from blood draws.

<p>·       Epogen® causes hypertension if the hematocrit is raised
 &gt; 35% in ESRD and does not work in the setting of iron deficiency.

<p>·       Follow the hemoglobin and not the hematocrit. The hematocrit
 is calculated from two measured values and has a ± 3 point range
 for error.

<p> 

<p> 

<h>MICROCYTIC ANEMIA (MCV &lt; 80)

<p> 

<p>1.     Work-up: order iron, ferritin, transferrin, and if possible
 a red cell distribution width (RDW).

<p> 

<p>2.     Iron deficiency: On physical exam, look for koilonychia,
 atrophic tongue.  Iron deficiency usually does not cause a microcytic
 anemia until the hematocrit drops below 30%.  Ferritin is useful
 for diagnosing iron deficiency. The likelihood ratios are as
 follows: for a ferritin &lt;15 the LR=50 in favor of iron deficiency
 anemia; for a ferritin &lt;25 the LR=10, specificity of 98%;
 for a ferritin &gt;100 the LR=0.1. Since ferritin is an acute
 phase reactant, some say it should not be used in the setting
 of inflammation; others say that in chronic inflammation a ferritin
 &lt; 50 is highly suggestive of iron deficiency.  Iron is low
 and transferrin or TIBC (total iron binding capacity) is high,
 which makes the transferrin saturation (iron divided by transferrin)
 low: a saturation &lt;10% has a specificity of 88%. The RDW
 (reflecting anisocytosis) is high. Once you’ve made the diagnosis,
 rule out GI bleeding: around 60% of patients will have GI lesions.
 Order stool guiaics, a colonoscopy, and possibly an EGD.  With
 treatment, the hematocrit should be normal in 2 months; continue
 iron treatment 4-6 months to replete stores. Common side effect
 of oral iron is constipation.  IV iron available if patient
 refractory to PO, but has increased risk of anaphylaxis. Each
 PRBC transfused contains 200 mg elemental iron.

<p> 

<p>3.     Sideroblastic anemia: hereditary cases are usually microcytic
 while acquired sideroblastic anemia may be normocytic. Acquired
 causes include lead, INH, EtOH, B6 deficiency. Basophilic stippling
 and dimorphic RBC morphology is seen on peripheral blood smear.

<p> 

<p>4.     Thalassemia: The Mentzer index may be helpful: (MCV/RBC
 count) &lt; 13 favors thalassemia over iron deficiency.  This
 test has a high sensitivity but low specificity.  Basically
 in iron deficiency, the marrow can’t produce RBCs and they’re
 small so the RBC count will be low along with the MCV.  In thalassemia,
 RBC production is preserved, though the cells are small and
 fragile.  So the RBC count is normal with a low MCV.  This concept
 may be more helpful than remembering the Mentzer index.  The
 RDW in thalassemia, unlike iron deficiency, is normal and may
 be a more accurate discriminant function in differentiating
 between the two.  Make the diagnosis of beta-thalassemia with
 hemoglobin electrophoresis. Alpha-thalassemia will not show
 up on electrophoresis: it is diagnosed by molecular diagnostic
 techniques. Order an “A-thal” on the lab slip. Think of Alpha
 thalassemia in Asians.  Beta thal in Meditteraneans.   Differential
 diagnosis for target cells on smear: beta thalassemia, hemoglobin
 C disease, liver disease, beta-lipoproteinemia.  In general
 you should not see targets in sickle cell unless they are sickle-thalassemia
 or sickle-C.

<p> 

<p>5.     Anemia of chronic disease: Chronic inflammatory diseases,
 that is, such as cancer and collagen-vascular diseases. Transferrin
 is decreased, saturation increased, iron low, ferritin normally
 increased (non specific for chronic disease). The MCV rarely
 falls below 78, though the patient can become microcytic because
 they are functionally deficient of iron.

<h>NORMOCYTIC ANEMIA (MCV 80-100)

<h> 

<l>First check a reticulocyte count.  Your goal is to come up with
 a reticulocyte index (RI).

<l>If your lab gives you an absolute reticulocyte count, make into
 a percent reticulocyte count by dividing by the RBC count. 
 Make sure to convert your units!

<l>Now correct the reticulocyte count for the patient’s hematocrit
 (HCT).  Corrected reticulocyte count = % reticulocytes x (actual
 hematocrit ¸ ideal hematocrit).

<l>Now correct for early release of reticulocytes by dividing by
 (1 + 0.5x) where x is 1 for every drop of 10% in the hematocrit.
  For example, divide by 1.5 for HCT=35% and divide by 2 for
 HCT=25%.

<l>You now have the reticulocyte index (RI).  If the RI &lt; 2 for
 HCT 10-35%, or &lt; 3 for HCT &lt; 10%, your patient has a hypoproliferative
 anemia.

<p>-        Mixed: e.g. an alcoholic with megaloblastic anemia from
 folate deficiency, and iron deficiency from GI bleeding. The
 MCV is normal, but the RDW is increased reflecting anisocytosis
 (cells of varying sizes).

<p> 

<p>4.     Increased reticulocyte count: check smear for schistocytes
 (intravascular hemolysis) and/or spherocytes (extravascular
 hemolysis).

<p>·       Acute blood loss: If you can’t find a source, don’t forget
 to rule out occult retroperitoneal bleed.

<p>·       Correction: of a production deficit. Peak MCV at 7-10
 days.

<p>·       Hemolysis: see below.

<p> 

<p>5.     Hemolysis:

<l>Classification is based on:

<p>-        Site of hemolysis (intravascular vs. extravascular)
 or

<p>-        Intrinsic (RBC defect) vs. an acquired extrinsic mechanism
 (where transfused cells will have a shortened life span).

<p>-        Send LDH, total and direct bilirubin, and possibly haptoglobin
 (level &lt; 25 is 96% specific for hemolysis).  A normal LDH
 and haptoglobin &gt; 25 helped rule out hemolysis in one small
 study.  Haptoglobin overall is not very useful as it takes one
 week to return, is an acute phase reactant, and is very sensitive
 (leading to decreased specificity).

<l>Extravascular causes: RBCs destroyed by the reticuloendothelial
 system.

<l>Extrinsic causes:

<p>-        Hypersplenism

<p>-        Antibody-mediated: warm (IgG) vs. cold (IgM) think Mono,
 Mycoplasma;check Coomb’s. Spherocytes are on the smear. Drugs
 are a big offender as well.

<p>-        Trauma/ Red Cell fragmentation: heart valve, hemodialysis,
 malignant HTN, vasculitis, HELLP, cardiopulmonary bypass, TTP/HUS,
 DIC.  Look for schistocytes and helmet cells (even 1-2 per HPF),
 and spherocytes. Remember: DIC increases INR and PTT, HUS and
 TTP do not.

<p>-        Enzyme:  e.g. G6PD deficiency: normal smear and Coomb’s.
 Check G6PD levels, which may be normal after an acute hemolytic
 episode or post transfusion. Consider this in HIV patients,
 particularly African Americans, taking PCP prophylaxis. Although
 this is X-linked recessive, it may still occur in females due
 to lyonization.

<p>-        PNH: complement-mediated lysis. Consider with pancytopenia,
 unexplained thrombosis (especially intra-abdominal) and an elevated
 reticulocyte count and LDH. A rare diagnosis.

 serum haptoglobin in hemolytic disease.

<p>JAMA. 1980 May 16;243(19):1909-11.

<p> 

<h>MACROCYTIC ANEMIA (MCV &gt; 100)

<h> 

<p>1.     Megaloblastic: hypersegmented neutrophils (&gt; 5% of
 neutrophils with 5 lobes or &gt; 1% with 6 lobes) are seen on
 the smear. An MCV &gt; 120 is almost pathognomonic for megaloblastic
 anemia. Ovalocytes may be seen, but are nonspecific. On physical
 exam, look for atrophic tongue.

<p>·       B12 deficiency: diagnose with serum B12. This value may
 be falsely decreased secondary to folate deficiency or type
 1 cryoglobulinemia (e.g. multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia).
 Look for subacute combined degeneration.  Can send homocysteine
 and methylmalonic acid.  Schilling test to look at source of
 deficiency. May have pancytopenia.

<p>·       Folate deficiency: diagnose with RBC-Folate level.  (Serum
 folate fluctuates and is a poor proxy for folate stores).  May
 be falsely low secondary to B12 deficiency.

<p>·       Note: repletion of vitamin B12 should always accompany
 folate and iron therapy until you are sure the patient does
 not have multiple deficiencies, in order to avoid aplastic-type
 crisis and/or high output CHF.  In addition, folate may partially
 correct the megaloblastic anemia of B12 deficiency while the
 neurologic symptoms progress.

<p> 

<p>2.     Non-megaloblastic: MCV &lt; 110 in most cases.

<p>·       Alcoholism: most common cause of macrocytic anemia.

<p>·       Liver disease

<p>·       Hypothyroidism

<p>·       Reticulocytosis: although the reticulocyte MCV is 160
 microns, reticulocytosis rarely causes an MCV above 110.  Polychromasia
 is seen on smear.

<p>·       Spurious: hyperglycemia and hypernatremia, secondary
 to osmotic swelling.

<h> 

<h>DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS

<p>2.     Over 9 in 10 pulmonary emboli originate from DVTs, and
 the treatment of PE and DVT are usually identical.

<p> 

<p>3.     DVTs are associated with calf pain and tenderness. Homan’s
 sign—pain when dorsiflexing the foot with the knee extended—is
 neither sensitive nor specific and should be abandoned.

<p> 

<p>4.     DVT prophylaxis should be addressed in all inpatients.
 Encourage early ambulation and order physical therapy when indicated.
 Obtain prophylaxis with sequential compression devices, low
 dose ultrafractionated heparin, or low molecular weight heparin
 (e.g. enoxaparin).  See also Medical Consultation: DVT/PE prophylaxis.

<p> 

<p>5.     Simple clinical model to diagnose DVT:

<p>·       Give the patient one (1) point for each of the following
 (if they are present): active cancer, immobilization, bedridden
 &gt; than 3 days due to surgery, localized tenderness, entire
 leg swelling, asymmetric &gt; 3 cm calf swelling,  pitting edema,
 or collateral superficial veins (nonvaricose).

<l>Is there an alternative diagnosis that is as likely or more likely
 than DVT?  If yes, subtract 2 points.

<l>Score &gt; 3: high probability of DVT, prevalence of DVT 75%.

<l>Score 1-2: moderate probability of DVT, prevalence of DVT 17%.

<l>Score 0: low probability of DVT, prevalence of 3%.

<p> 

<p>6.     Work-up of suspected DVT:

<p>·       D-dimers: very useful if your local hospital has the
 ELISA test which is very sensitive (good for ruling out DVT).
  Some labs use the latex agglutination test, which is only 85-90%
 sensitive. Thus, in a patient with a non-diagnostic V/Q scan
 (for PE) or Doppler ultrasound (for DVT), a negative D-dimer
 (ELISA method) means it is probably safe not to anticoagulate
 if your clinical suspicion is low or moderate.

<p>·       Doppler ultrasound: This test is better at detecting
 DVTs above the knee (which, in fact, are the clinically significant
 ones as clots below the knee rarely cause pulmonary embolism).
  Ultrasound is 50% sensitive in an asymptomatic individual,
 and therefore cannot be used to rule out PE. Ultrasound is also
 less sensitive than venogram for calf DVT.

<p> 

<p>7.     Hypercoagulability work-up:

<l>After the first event, the hypercoaguable work-up will lead to
 an etiology in only 30% of patients; after the second DVT only
 50% will eventually have an etiology determined.  Moreover,
 only 10-20% of people with an idiopathic DVT will ever have
 another event.

<p>·       It is not necessary to begin the work up of anticoagulation
 at the time of the clot: the results won’t change your management
 and will take a while to come back anyway; therefore, consider
 an outpatient work-up.

<p>·       Guidelines for hypercoagulability work-up:

<p>-        Draw an extra blue top tube before starting heparin
 or warfarin if you suspect a hypercoaguable state: heparin will
 interfere with assays for antithrombin III and the lupus anticoagulant.

<p>-        Protein C, S, anticardiolipin antibodies, homocysteine,
 prothrombin 20210A, Factor V Leiden, and MTHFR mutations (leading
 to hyperhomocysteinemia) can be sent when patients are taking
 heparin.  Note that Proteins C and S are vitamin K dependent
 factors and will be lowered by warfarin therapy.

<p>-        AT III, Protein C, and Protein S may be transiently
 depressed during the acute event, and only persistent lupus
 anticoagulants are associated with hypercoagulability. Therefore,
 repeat abnormal tests later to make an accurate diagnosis.

<p>-        Note that there is not a consensus that all patients
 with unprovoked DVT/PE should have a hypercoagulability work-up.
  The most common defects are not associated with recurrent disease,
 and the ones that are, are uncommon.  A targeted work-up is
 likely a more reasonable approach (e.g. send antiphospholipid
 antibody as persistent lupus anticoagulant is associated with
 venous/arterial recurrence and may require a higher INR goal
 for warfarin therapy).

<p> 

<p>8.     Treatment: typically involves heparin (or enoxaparin)
 and warfarin.  Some advocate giving patients heparin for 5 days,
 even if their INR becomes therapeutic in less than 5 days. Patients
 should be therapeutically anticoagulated as soon as possible
 (within 24 hours). Thus, it is better to overshoot and risk
 bleeding than to undershoot and risk further embolic/thrombotic
 events.  See Hematology/Oncology: Heparinand Hematology/Oncology:
 Warfarin (below).

<p>2.     When to use low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin):
 LMWH eliminates the need to monitor PTT and adjust dosages.
 You may send selected patients home with enoxaparin and warfarin,
 rather than keeping them in-house on heparin for 5 days or until
 they are therapeutic on warfarin (see Hematology/Oncology: Outpatient
 therapy for venous thromboembolism).  Moreover, LMWH is associated
 with a lower incidence of heparin-associated thrombocytopenia.
  Regular, ultrafractionated heparin is preferable when:

<l>Patients require prolonged hospitalization anyway (cost savings
 over enoxaparin) or

<l>Rapid reversal of anticoagulation might be necessary (e.g. possible
 surgery).

<p> 

<p>3.     Consider a hematology consult before using LMWH in the
 following situations:

<h>WARFARIN

<p> 

<p>1.     Give the warfarin on day one of heparin or enoxaparin
 if long-term anticoagulation is desired.  Usually 5.0-7.5 mg
 PO at night (to ensure absorption on an empty stomach) on Day
 1, then 2.5-7.5 mg PO QHS (most often 5 mg). Increase in the
 INR of &gt; 0.3-0.4 units per day should result in a dose reduction
 (otherwise an INR overshoot is likely).

<p> 

<p>2.     Goal for INR:

<l>An INR of 2.5-3.5 for mechanical prosthetic valves or recurrent
 systemic thromboembolism

<l>INR of 2.0-3.0 for most others (uncomplicated DVT/PE).

<p> 

<p>3.     Information about the patient's past warfarin dosing history
 will help you titrate appropriately. Congestive heart failure,
 liver disease, vitamin K deficiency and certain medications
 influence warfarin response. Tailor the duration of warfarin
 therapy to the individual and the indication – usually three
 months to life.

<h>OUTPATIENT THERAPY FOR VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM

<p>·       Clinically stable patients with DVT or PE documented
 with imaging study.

<p>·       Patients must be motivated and interested in home self-injection
 and frequent follow-up.

<p> 

<p>2.     Contraindications:

<p>·       Co-morbid conditions: Active peptic ulcer disease, bleeding
 in last 14 days, brain metastases, CVA in last 10 days, blindness,
 CNS or cord injury/surgery in last 10 days, family bleeding
 diathesis, patient weight &lt;35 kg, platelets &lt; 80K or fall
 of &gt; 40%.

<p>·       Anesthesia: Spinal or epidural anesthesia in past 3 days.

<p>·       Medication conflicts: prior sensitivity to heparin, concomitant
 thrombolytic therapy, need for high-dose NSAIDs other than ibuprofen,
 naproxen, or Celebrex®.  Vioxx® may result in warfarin sensitivity.

<p>·       Cognition problems: inability to maintain diary, inject
 medications, reliably follow medication schedules, recognize
 change in health status, or understand directions from home
 health team.

<p>3.     Use oral vitamin K to correct mild to moderate PT prolongation.
 Correction occurs within 10-12 hours. Subcutaneous vitamin K
 is as good as IV vitamin K, minus the risk of anaphylaxis.

<p>5.     Bebulin is a plasma-derived concentrate of factors II,
 VII, IX, and X.  It should be used in life threatening bleeds
 associated with warfarin.  Dose Bebulin ~50 U/kg IV push (need
 to give concomitant vitamin K).

<p> 

<p>6.     For heparin associated bleeding:

<p>·       Unfractionated heparin: Protamine 1 mg for every 100
 units heparin given. Dose by adding the amount given during
 each prior hour divided by 2 number of hours back.  For example,
 a patient on a heparin drip at 500 units/hour for 3 hours (without
 a bolus) would have approximately (500/20)+(500/21)+(500/22)
 =  500 + (500/2) + (500/4) = 875 units of circulating heparin.
  Therfore, the patient should be given 8-9 mg of protamine.

<p>·       Enoxaparin: 1mg:1mg. Protamine may reverse 40-50% of
 the drug effect.

<p> 

<p>1.     Tips:

<p>·       Keep hematocrit &gt; 24%

<p>·       Keep platelets &gt; 75K

<p>·       FFP may be helpful if bleeding occurs in the setting
 of an elevated INR

<h> 
 BLOOD PRODUCTS – COMPONENTS

<p>1.     Premeds: consider pre-medicating with Benadryl 25 mg PO/IV
 and Tylenol 650 mg PO/PR before each unit.

<p> 

<p>2.     Packed red blood cells (PRBC):

<p>·       Most plasma removed. One unit should raise the hematocrit
 by 3 points or hemoglobin by 1 g/dL.

<p>·       Leuko-poor/leuko-filtered red blood cells have most WBCs
 removed to make it less antigenic. Use in patients prone to
 transfusion reactions and in patients requiring multiple transfusions
 (bone marrow transplant, leukemia, chemotherapy).

<p>·       Washed red blood cells have WBC almost all removed. Use
 as for leuko-poor RBC; note that they are more expensive.  Used
 for patients with allergic reaction to transfusions.

<p>·       CMV negative blood used for patients who are CMV negative
 and are pre-transplant or post-transplant.

<p> 

<p>3.     Platelets:

<p>·       A 6-pack should  ideally raise platelet count by 50-60K;
 For dysfunctional platelets (e.g. in uremia), DDAVP is usually
 given at 0.3 mcg/kg IV q12-24 hours x 2. Do not correct platelets
 for paracentesis.

<p>·       Cross-matched platelets may be used when patient has
 been sensitized to random-donor platelets and no longer bumps
 their platelet counts after transfusion; cross-matching typically
 takes at least 1-2 days as well as lab medicine approval at
 most institutions.

<p>·       Always check a 1 hour post-transfusion platelet count
 to ensure a response and to monitor for alloimmunization.

<p> 

<p>4.     Fresh frozen plasma (FFP):

<p>·       A high PT is frequently encountered in end-stage liver
 disease. It is generally okay to leave a high PT alone when
 a patient is not bleeding. For those with refractory bleeding,
 use an FFP drip—the half-life of FFP is about 4-6 hours.

<p>·       FFP is indicated if the PT &gt; 18 seconds and is associated
 with bleeding or planned procedures.

<p> 

<h>5.     Cryoprecipitate:

<p>·       Use is generally reserved for patients with quantitative
 fibrinogen deficiency (e.g. DIC) and qualitative fibrinogen
 deficits (e.g. acquired dysfibrinogenemia associated with liver
 disease). Its use in patients with hemophilia A (factor VIII
 deficiency) and von Willebrand disease has been supplanted by
 the use of specific factor products that are safer and more
 efficacious.

<p>·       Advantage: you can replete with less volume than FFP.

<h> 

<h>BLOOD PRODUCTS – COMPLICATIONS

<h> 

<p>1.     Work-up: for all transfusion reactions consider a workup
 for a hemolytic reaction: blood cultures and hemolysis labs,
 including purple top for Coombs and red top for repeat type
 and cross.  The blood bank is required to investigate and will
 help. The different types of reactions are listed below.

<p> 

<p>2.     Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction:

<p>·       Preexisting anti-RBC antibodies in the recipient hemolyze
 donated blood. Usually caused by ABO incompatibility due to
 a clerical error. Fever and hypotension occur early in the transfusion;
 chills, flank pain, and dyspnea may occur.

<p>-        Stop blood product immediately, as little as 30 cc can
 be fatal.

<p>-        Provide hemodynamic and renal support.

<p>-        Maintain diuresis with IV fluids and furosemide; consider
 alkalinization of urine with bicarbonate to prevent renal failure.
 Watch K+, CK.

<p> 

<p>3.     Delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction:

<p>·       An extravascular immune-mediated process mediated by
 noncomplement-binding IgG. Ideally, the “screen” portion of
 the type and screen will identified patients susceptible to
 this complication.  Fever, jaundice, and anemia occur 2 days
 to 2 weeks after transfusion.

<p> 

<p>4.     Anaphylaxis:

<p>·       This is different from an acute hemolytic reaction. 
 Interestingly, the reaction is not IgE mediated, but caused
 by immune-complex activation of complement – by “anaphylatoxins.”
  Symptoms are anaphylactoid, occur early in transfusion, and
 include laryngeal edema.

<p>·       Look for endotoxemia—the onset of high fever/shock within
 4 hours of transfusion. Platelets are far more likely to be
 contaminated with bacteria than blood, because they are stored
 are room temperature.

<p> 

<p>6.     Acute lung injury:

<p>·       i.e. “noncardiogenic pulmonary edema”. Also termed “TRALI”—transfusion-related
 acute lung injury.  This is caused by donor antibodies against
 recipient WBCs. Respiratory failure occurs within 6 hours of
 transfusion and treatment is supportive.

<p> 

<p>7.     Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction:

<p>·       This is characterized by fever &gt; 1° C during or within
 2 hours of completing transfusion. It occurs with 1 in 5 platelet
 transfusion reactions and is of limited clinical significance.
 It is questionable whether it is necessary to discontinue the
 transfusion. Caused by antibodies against foreign donor leukocyte
 antigens.

<p> 

<p>8.     Urticarial reaction:

<p>·       Some say it is okay to continue transfusion if the patient
 responds to antihistamines. Again, this is different from—and
 does not progress to—an anaphylactiod reaction.

<h>NEUTROPENIC FEVER: ABSOLUTE NEUTROPHIL COUNT &lt; 500

<p>·       Obtain blood culture x 2, urine culture, sputum Gram
 stain and culture, C. difficile toxin if patient has been on
 antibiotics, and CXR.

<p>·       Order neutropenic precautions (no rectals, no flowers,
 no fruit), neutropenic diet, mouth care with Peridex 10 cc sw/sp
 bid, Nystatin 10 cc sw/sw qid or Mycelex troche 1 qid, and Tylenol
 650 mg q 4-6 hour prn.

<p>·       Consider monotherapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics
 such as ceftazidime, cefipime or anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam.
 Cover for Gram negative bacteria including Pseudomonas.  Also
 cover Gram positives such as Staph aureus and Strep viridans.

<p>-        For nosocomial acquisition, suspected IV catheter infection,
 known colonization with MRSA/PRSP, (+) blood culture for Gram
 positive cocci, or a hypotensive patient, consider covering
 MRSA by adding vancomycin.

<p>-        Double-cover documented Pseudomonas by adding an aminoglycoside
 or a fluoroquinolone, such as ciprofloxacin. The fluoroquinolone
 is preferable given the renal toxicity of aminoglycosides.

<p> 

<h>3.     Bone marrow transplant patients: the guidelines above
 still apply, except for the following:

<h>·       Most hospitals that have a bone marrow transplant unit
 have an antibiotic algorithm that you should follow when treating
 bone marrow transplant patients with neutropenic fever.

<h>·       The patients most likely to suffer from full blown sepsis
 syndrome are those who are penicillin-allergic.

<p> 

<p> 

<h>SICKLE CELL PAIN CRISIS

<p> 

<p>Your hospital staff typically know these patients well.  Often,
 the patient’s primary physician has contracted with the patient
 for an individualized pain protocol.  Consider consultation
 with the hematologist or pain service to get the exact details
 (if they exist).  Don’t be surprised by massive opiate tolerance
 and the need to rapidly escalate the analgesia dose required
 for relief: remember, physicians typically under-treat pain.
  Unlike most opioids, such as morphine and oxycodone, codeine
 and hydrocodone have ceilings beyond which increasing doses
 will not result in increasing analgesia.

<p> 

<p>1.     Tips:

<p>·       Stroke, MI, persistent priapism, or intractable pain
 characterize acute vaso-occlusive crises. Exchange transfusion
 is indicated in these cases. Also, multi-organ failure requires
 urgent exchange transfusion.

<p>·       If patient with frequent episodes of pain crisis, consider
 hydroxyurea as prophylaxis.

<l>In the past, the dogma for treating sickle cell crises called
 for aggressive fluids, oxygen, and even bicarbonate infusions
 as methods to reverse the “sickling” process in the red blood
 cells.  However, we have since learned that the event that led
 to the sickle crisis (and thus the “sickling”) has already occurred
 by the time the patient comes into the ER.  Therefore, these
 measures are unlikely to be helpful and may be harmful (see
 below).

<p> 

<h>2.     Orders:

<p>·       IV: moderate hypotonic (e.g. D5½NS) hydration.  Aggressive
 hydration can lead to or exacerbate acute chest syndrome.

<p>·       NURSING: O2 0-4 L/min by NC. (If respiratory status is
 compromised, remember acute chest syndrome. A new pulmonary
 infiltrate, fever, chest pain, cough, tachypnea and cough are
 characteristic).

<p>·       LAB: CBC, reticulocyte count, cultures, electrolytes,
 BUN, creatinine, bilirubin, U/A, CXR.  Draw red-top tube for
 type and hold. (If patient is to be transfused, alert the blood
 bank that the patient has sickle cell disease; these patients
 will be screened more thoroughly to avoid alloimmunization associated
 with frequent transfusions).

<p>·       MEDS:Folic acid 1 mg PO QD and analgesic du jour.  Avoid
 Demerol: these patients will inevitably require huge doses,
 and are at greatly increased risk of seizures.

<p> 

<p>3.     Try to determine precipitating factor(s): stress, dehydration,
 drug use, infection, hypoxia, MI, etc. Although, remember that
 many of these patients come in and out of the hospital for "routine"
 pain crises without specific precipitants. While pain crises
 often present with non-specific elevations in WBC and low-grade
 fevers, there always is the potential for something bad to be
 going on. Therefore complete work up of concomitant infection
 is important.

<p> 

<p>4.     Acute chest syndrome: This is one of the dreaded complications
 of sickle cell disease and a leading cause of death in adults
 with this disease.  You should think of this diagnosis in any
 patient with cough, chest pain, wheezing, shortness of breath,
 fever, and/or new infiltrate on CXR who has a history of sickle
 cell disease.  Etiology is not fully known, but thought to involve
 micro/macro vascular infarction, pulmonary fat emboli, and concurrent
 viral/bacterial infection.  Management primarily consists of
 supportive care, bronchodilators, treatment of coexisting infection,
 and transfusions if needed.  In addition, a simple transfusion
 may be adequate, but if the patient’s clinical situation worsens
 an exchange transfusion may be needed.

<h>THROMBOCYTOPENIA

<p> 

<p>1.     Defined as platelet count &lt; 150K. Generally, platelets
 &gt; 50K are not associated with significant bleeding, and spontaneous
 bleeding rarely happens with platelets &gt;10-20K in the absence
 of coagulopathy or qualitative platelet defect.

<p>4.     Labs: peripheral smear, PT/PTT, LDH (MAHA), BUN/Cr (HUS/TTP).
 Get HIV, ANA when indicated, and consider toxoplasmosis, EBV,
 and CMV serology if lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, or “B”-symptoms
 are detected.

<h>·       Sequestration: Hypersplenism

<h>HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA (HIT)

<p> 

<h>1.     There are primarily two types of HIT:

<p> 

<p> 

<p>Type 1

<p>Type 2

<p>Frequency

<p>10-20%

<p>1-3%

<p>Timing

<p>1-4 days

<p>5-10 days

<p>Nadir of platelet count

<p>30-55,000

<p>Antibody mediated

<p>No

<p>Yes

<p>Thromboembolic sequelae

<p>None

<p>30-80%

<p>Hemorrhagic sequelae

<p>None

<p>Rarely

<p>Management

<p>Observe

<p>Discontinue heparin and start alternate anticoagulant.

<h> 

<h>2.     Diagnosis: think of this diagnosis in your hospitalized
 patients whose platelet count starts dropping.

<h>·       You can diagnose HIT type 2 by sending platelet factor
 4 antibody, although this syndrome is primarily a clinical diagnosis.

<h> 

<h>3.     Incidence: HIT occurs less frequently now with the increased
 use of low molecular weight heparin.

<h> 

<h>4.     Complications: the thrombotic complications can be arterial
 or venous and often occur at sites of preexisting pathology.

<p> 

<h>5.     Treatment: includes stopping all heparin products (including
 heparin flushes and coated catheters), and instituting alternate
 anticoagulation, as these patients are at increased risk of
 thrombosis.  Choices include danaparoid (a heparinoid) or lepirudin
 and argatroban (direct thrombin inhibitors).

<h>ONCOLOGIC EMERGENCIES

<p> 

<p>1.     Cord compression: see Neurology: Cord compressionfor more
 details.  Remember early treatment is key—dexamethasone, radiation,
 and neurosurgical evaluation.

<p>3.     Cerebral metastases: can present as headache, seizures,
 altered mental status, or focal deficit.  Common in breast and
 lung cancer.  Diagnose with head CT.  Treat with dexamethasone,
 radiation, and possible surgery.  With edema, mass effect, and/or
 midline shift, consider measures to control the rise in intracranial
 pressure (ICP) such as mannitol and hyperventilation.

<p> 

<p>4.     Carcinomatous meningitis: may present as seizures, focal
 neurologic deficits, peripheral neuropathy, or altered mental
 status.  Occurs most often with breast cancer, lymphoma, and
 leukemia.  Diagnose  with spinal fluid cytology.   Treat with
 intrathecal chemotherapy or whole brain radiation.

<p> 

<p>5.     Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome: presents with facial
 and/or upper extremity edema as well as dyspnea on exertion.
  Commonly seen with lung cancer and lymphoma.  Diagnose with
 CT scan (gold standard).  Treat with radiation and/or chemotherapy
 based on tumor type.  Surgery is often risky and dangerous.

<p> 

<p>6.     Hypercalcemia: Presents gradually with fatigue, anorexia,
 constipation, polyuria, and confusion.  Can occur with squamous
 cell carcinomas, breast cancer, small cell lung cancer, and
 myeloma.  Treat with hydration, lasix, calcitonin and pamidronate
 if needed. See also Acid-base/Electrolytes: Hypercalcemia.

<p> 

<p>7.     Tumor lysis syndrome: findings include ­ potassium, ­
 phosphorous, ­ uric acid, ­ creatinine, and ¯ calcium.  Often
 occurs with tumors that are bulky and very chemotherapy-sensitive.
   Seen often in Burkitt’s lymphoma.  Prevent with hydration
 and allopurinol.  If patient develops syndrome, treat electrolyte
 abnormalities and continue hydration and allopurinol.

<p> 

<p>8.     Hyperviscosity: patients present with nonspecific CNS
 symptoms such as headache, dizziness, somnolence, and blurry
 vision.  More often occurs in patient with myeloma, Waldenstrom’s
 macroglobulinemia, and polycythemia vera.   Obtain CSF, head
 CT to rule out other CNS processes. Treat with hydration, phlebotomy
 (for polycythemia vera), and chemotherapy.

<p> 

<p>9.     Leukostasis: occurs with very high white blood cell count
 in acute leukemias.  Symptoms include hypoxia, renal insufficiency,
 altered mental status, and somnolence. Can worsen during induction
 chemotherapy.  Obtain CSF and head CT to rule out other diagnoses.
  Treat with leukopheresis, hydration, induction chemotherapy,
 and possibly hydroxyurea.  Avoid blood product transfusions
 as this might worsen symptoms.  Wait until after you white blood
 cells have been removed by leukopheresis.

<p> 

<p>10.  DIC: often occurs in patients with AML (especially M3 variant)
 and adenocarcinoma patients.  Diagnose by PT/PTT, fibrinogen,
 platelet count, and D-dimers.  Treat by correcting deficits—platelet
 transfusions, FFP, vitamin K, cryoprecipitate.  Treat the underlying
 cause.  Heparin is occasionally used to suppress the consumptive
 process, but the data on this is limited.
