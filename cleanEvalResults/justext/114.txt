<p>Glass (b. 1937), along with Steve Reich, La Monte Young, and
 Terry Riley, helped shape the minimalist movement. His highly
 recognizable style has won Glass wide critical and commercial
 acceptance. Glass's music is marked by its repetitions and bright
 keyboard figures, and he has made important inroads into scoring
 music for films and unconventional operas. Here are his essential
 recordings.

 Although Einstein on the Beach is by definition an opera, Philip
 Glass's most famous work also transcends traditional music categories.
 Glass avoided all vestiges of plot in the piece and dug deep
 into his quiver of repetitions to create an artfully unnerving
 five hours of brilliance. The instrumental ensemble never exceeds
 five members, playing electric keyboards, saxophones, flutes,
 and a single violin. Furthermore, the music congregates around
 the upper registers, often darting through its...Read more

 Fifteen years after its initial release, Philip Glass's score
 to Godfrey Reggio's film Koyaanisqatsi is still as timeless

 is still unlike anything Glass has composed, a Tibetan...Read

 This is an extraordinary retelling of the classic story "The
 Beauty and the Beast", this time based on the Jean Cocteau film
 La Belle et la Bete. Philip Glass, one of our reigning minimalists,
 studied under Darius Milhaud and Nadia Boulanger in Paris and
 his music has always had a quiet Debussy-like character to it.
 What is amazing is that Glass is one of the minimalists who
 have made a successful transition into opera (John Adams is
 the other). And catch the scary silent-movie-house...Read more

 Philip Glass's early works have purely functional titles, and
 this one is no exception. His masterpiece in this repetitious
 and rigorously structural composition style-- Music in Twelve
 Parts--may be just too much for some people to take. If so,
 then this disc may be just the ticket. Of course, Glass's many
 fans will snap it up as a matter of course, but as the title
 implies, there's somewhat more happening here than in his very
 first minimalist works--just enough so that newcomers to the
 style...Read more

<p>Glassworks remains Philip Glass's bestseller from the middle
 period of his career, the recording by means of which many listeners
 familiarized themselves with his music. Conceived as a thematically
 whole instrumental studio album taking advantage of the promotional
 and marketing capabilities of what was then Glass's new major
 label (CBS, now Sony Classical) and targeted at consumers intrigued
 with his newfound notoriety, Glassworks features six parts (three
 per side on the original LP and...Read more
