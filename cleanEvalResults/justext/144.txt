<h>Brush-B-Gone / Roundup

<h> Mixed it according to label recommendations, then you probably
 will get a good kill of the parts you sprayed. The first sign
 is curling and twisting (epinasty in plant physiology terms),
 and it may take a week or two to look real dead. Some resprouting
 may occur from areas of the root system that the chemical did
 not reach. Respray after these sprouts reach 8 or 10 inches
 (too soon and there may not be enough leaf area to absorb enough
 chemical). Triclopyr (the active chemical) is sooo much more
 effective on woody plants than Roundup. But it really does little
 to kill grass family plants, or rosette type weeds that are
 already bolting. --(matson@NOSPAMawwwsome.com) submitted Jun/6/1999

<p> We just bought a piece of property and it has poison oak. It
 is covering a huge granite rock about 8 foot tall and 30 foot
 around. It is also growing between the rocks to the height of
 10 to 12 feet and also growing like a vine over the rocks. I
 got two spots the first time. It is maddening to itch like that.
 I went out and bought a gallon of round up. The kind you dilute
 with water to the correct consistency. I sprayed that huge plant.
 It has been reduced to dead leaves and dead branches. I used
 about one forth of the gallon to do the job. The gallon cost
 $85.00 but even though I am on a limited budget it was worth
 every penny. And I still have enough round up just in case it
 comes back up. Then I was clearing a spot on another part of
 our property and got it again. The first two places to break
 out were the ones where it was before and then it spread. Tonight
 I actually took a bath in diluted bleach. Tomorrow I am going
 to go spray that new plant. Thanks for your web site about the
 evils of poison oak and ivy. Naoma Hayes --"ppainter13" (ppainter13@NOSPAMmsn.com)

<p> I have found Brush-B-Gone foam to be the best product for complete,
 easy removal of Poison Ivy. It is sometimes hard to find, perhaps
 they're discontinuing the foam? One can removed all the Poison
 Ivy in our large backyard with one application per plant (including
 a vine running some 20+ feet up a tree, about 4" around at base),
 and because it's a foam it is much easier to not hit plants
 you don't want to kill. --"J. Simon" (mnrsage@NOSPAMvisi.net)

<p> My comment is about Round-up, and its use on Poison Ivy etc.
 Guys, Round-Up doesn't work!! It's just that simple. It kills
 the upper leaves, but the roots remain. This product is a complete
 rip, and we are wasting our $$. And not just poison ivy, round
 up won't kill grass long term. What does work? Pick axes, hoes,
 gloves you wear for roses, and washing in cold water within
 one hour of known exposure. --"molly" (mollysimonds@NOSPAMhotmail.com)
 submitted 8/Jun/2003Editor: It is true that you might have to
 re-apply round-up but it will eventually kill poison ivy completely
 as I now have acres of no poison ivy to prove it. I have had
 to repeat my applications up to 3 times on some very resilient
 plants over a summer. You will not kill the big vines though
 and will need to cut a segment and use a herbicide containing
 triclopyr for those tough guys. 
 Pick axes, hoes, and gloves
 are a sure thing. The other nice thing about your comments is
 that its better for the environment and doesn't cost any money!
 Thank you. 

<p> I have used Roundup, etc for poison ivy, oak, but the only thing
 that I have found to really "kill" poison oak or ivy is Brush-B-Gone!!

<h>General Discussion

<h> Contact with poison ivy can leave you with a rash and persistent
 itch. This native perennial grows throughout Virginia, in woods,
 fields, and sometimes in the garden. It grows in sun or shade,
 and in wet or dry places. Its growth habit depends on where
 it is growing, resulting in a trailing ground cover, free-standing
 shrub, or a vine supported by trees, shrubbery and fences. 

<p> All parts of the poison ivy plant contain an oil, urushiol,
 which causes the allergic reaction. Most poisoning occur during
 the growing season when the presence of lush foliage increases
 the chance of contact, but the dormant stems and roots of the
 vine can cause winter poisoning as well. Individuals vary in
 their sensitivity to poison ivy, but repeated exposure can lead
 to increased sensitivity. It would be a good idea for everyone
 to avoid this plant. 

<p> Poison ivy appears in many forms. The leaflets vary in size,
 glossiness, and marginal notching, but always occur in groups
 of three. If you avoid all unknown plants with leaves composed
 of three leaflets, you will be playing it safe. 

<p> Poison ivy is difficult but not impossible to eradicate. The
 chief difficulty lies in the chances of becoming poisoned when
 trying to remove it. Wear protective clothing, including gloves,
 whenever you are working near it. Pulling and grubbing are effective
 means of removal, though they necessitate close contact and
 will probably need to be repeated once or twice for complete
 control. If time is not an object, the vines can be smothered
 by completely covering them with black plastic for several months.
 Do not mow the plants as this will spew bits and pieces of poisonous
 material over the area. When removing poison ivy, take frequent
 breaks to change clothes and scrub thoroughly with a strong
 soap. Wash contaminated clothing separately. DO NOT BURN any
 plants that you physically remove. The resulting smoke can cause
 severe lung damage if inhaled. 

<p> Herbicides are effective and allow you to control the plant
 without getting too close to it. Several commercial products
 are available. Check labels to find one that will control poison
 ivy, and apply it as directed. Many of the herbicides for poison
 ivy control contain glyphosate. This chemical is systemic. It
 is absorbed by leaves and transferred to stems and roots, and
 slowly causes the death of the entire plant. It must be applied
 to an actively growing plant for this process to take place;
 do not apply it during a drought when even poison ivy will not
 be growing. Glyphosate, like most herbicides labelled for poison
 ivy removal, is nonselective and will kill any other plants
 it contacts. 

<p> Where poison ivy has grown up tree trunks or into hedges, cut
 the vine at ground level. Remove as much of the stump and roots
 as you can with a hoe or by pulling. As regrowth occurs, apply
 an herbicide to the leaves, or keep pulling up the growth. With
 perseverance, and probably of few itches, poison ivy can be
 controlled. --(f_rushingr@NOSPAMccsvax.sfasu.edu) submitted

<h>Household mixtures to kill poison ivy plants

<h> Here is one I found. Mix 3 pounds salt with 1 Gallon soapy water;
 spray the solution on the plant's leaves and stems. I have also
 used a combination of roundup and letting nature choke the plant
 (ie. wild rose) myself. --Editor (July/27/1999)

<p> I'm an environmentally sensitive landscaper and landscape designer
 with a good deal of experience in eliminating poison ivy from
 the landscape. And, little as I like the prospect of using an
 herbicide, out of considerations both for my personal health
 and for the environment, the only way I've found to get rid
 of substantial colonies of poison ivy is by the careful and
 responsible use of herbicide. 

<p> You can remove a single young plant or two by grasping it through
 a plastic garbage bag and pulling it up root and all. Turn the
 bag inside-out over the plant, and it's done. (You may have
 some growth return from broken roots, but can get rid of them
 in the same way.) 

<p>Glyphosate--the active ingredient in Roundup and Rodeo--is sometimes
 recommended for killing poison ivy. Because its active ingredient
 breaks down quickly, I initially tried to use Round-up, but
 found that plants could recover from as many as six applications
 over two years. Others with whom I've compared notes also describe
 similar experiences. I've only used the product as sold, with
 glyphosate. 

<p> The only thing that seems to work, in my experience, is a herbicide
 containing triclopyr. I've used Ortho Brush-b-Gon with a great
 deal of success. If I'm careful, I find I can spot-treat individual
 plants without doing much damage to what's growing around them.
 For greater accuracy, instead of spraying you can paint the
 herbicide directly on the leaves. 

<p> I hate to sound like a spokesperson for Monsanto. This company
 has many sins to answer for. And, as I've said above, I'm reluctant
 to use herbicides. But this product really does the job. 

<p> Use it with respect. Read the label and follow the directions
 religiously. Wait for a day when the winds are still. Don't
 use it in or within ten feet of a wetland. Use rubber gloves,
 and be careful not to breathe the spray. Wash up thoroughly
 afterwards, and put your clothes in the wash right away. 

<p>I strongly recommend against using salt to kill plants. Yes,
 we use salt in our food. But in the environment, in the quantities
 required, it's toxic and persistent--much more so than Roundup
 or Brush-b-Gon. It does not break down, and will continue to
 kill anything planted on the spot until it's thoroughly leached
 away--a matter of years even in regions of high rainfall. And
 even then, it continues to be a hazard, as it leaches into the
 groundwater. Using it is much more environmentally damaging
 than using herbicides whose sale for the purpose is allowed
 by the EPA. --Don Galbreath  submitted 23/Dec/2000Editor: Thanks
 Don for an excellent discussion! I have been using Roundup exclusively
 here on a little more than 2 acres and while it takes repeated
 spraying I have had reasonable results because it contains the
 ivy long enough that other more invasive plants can choke it
 out. I am in year 4 of what I call my experimental program and
 would call it a success this far given that I have elminated
 about 1/4 acre of just poison ivy plants. I have to completely
 agree that the Ortho Brush-b-Gon product is incredible and I
 apply it with a paint brush to all large old growth stems. 

<p> "Glyphosate" will kill it. It I guess is the active ingredient
 in systemic killers. I wonder if it can be bought "over the
 counter" instead of in "round-up", etc. -- Jeff (jzibrat@NOSPAMnb.net)

<p> Here is my way of getting back at that nasty plant and you don't
 have to spend alot of money...you need: 

<p> 1 cup of salt, 8 drops of liquid detergent, 1 gallon of vinegar,
 

<p> combine the salt and vinegar in a pan heat it up to dissolve
 the salt pour into a spray bottle and kill away. Warning this
 will kill all plants that you spray so don't spray anything
 important good luck. -- Eddie Shaughnessy (eddie337@NOSPAMhotmail.com)

<h>Large Area Control

<h> I use the following on poison ivy, if it is in a place where
 I want to get rid of it: 

<l> Growing in an open area (ie. field, etc.) - Mow it with the
 brush hog. After a while, if you mow it regularly, it will die.
 

<l>Growing up a tree - Cut the vine. If it is really big, use a
 chainsaw. If it is smaller, use what we call "nippers" (long
 handled shear like tool). 

<l> Occasionally, if it is growing in a place where either 1 or
 2 won't work, I spray it. For example, sometimes it will grow
 on the side of an outbuilding, but the vines are too small and
 numerous to cut easily. I use concentrated roundup diluted in
 water to the manufacturer's specifications and spray it. It
 always works for me. As far as getting rid of the rash, only
 time works for me. --(Rob Gray@NOSPAMAlpha.injersey.com) submitted
 Jun/26/1999Editor: I use a similiar approach but choose to use
 a bow saw for the big vines as I am worried about the chainsaw
 throwing more oil around. 

<h>Goats

<h> Goats. Goats do an excellent job of cleaning out poison ivy
 and other unwanted brush, especially when its growing up in
 the fence line. --(Sojourner@NOSPAMnotime4@summer.spam) submitted

<h>Mulch, Tarps, Pulling

<h> I've taken out long-established vines with trunks as big as
 your arm with but two or three strategic, thorough cuttings
 and a bit of digging and pulling. I carefully note locations
 of major vine colonies in the middle of winter here, when they're
 easier to see and brittle to cut as well. One had completely
 covered a large stone retaining wall, at the bank to the ramp
 to the main barn loft. In winter I removed major sections of
 matted vines from the stones, after cutting all along the perimeter
 of the wall. I threw mulch hay along the top of the wall and
 it killed the poison ivy there without further ado. I knew that
 there'd be a good burst of new growth from the base of the big
 vine I chopped away and dug out, but part of that would be mowed
 as part of the yard and the other would be the rest of the project.
 More runners would pull up as the ground thawed, too. Then I
 waited until the leaf growth was as good as it could be before
 the seeds form. I cut the vines twice each with a sharp action
 of the corn knife, two or more inches apart, digging aside the
 cut section. That takes only minutes. I usually let it rot in
 place or at least wilt down to a dry brown before removing it
 to a composting area for ornamental, non-food uses. The seeds
 are a big source of food for birds and end up under trees to
 a large extent, so thick mulches can be used in places where
 mowing isn't practical, as long as they don't extend right up
 to the trees. I search for separate smaller vines and pull them
 to find all their branches. It's often easy that way to get
 most of the ivy in a big area just by first locating a small
 number of well-spread vines. I have a spading fork, rake, and
 hay hook that I use to lift stubborn vines rather than cut into
 the dirt with the knife. I also use nippers to finish off each
 and every smaller sprout in the area. At most I'll check it
 to remove any resprouts, once, later in the season. If I remove
 a plant I replace it with something else, and I'll mulch heavily
 and position the replacements once I see that the growth is
 all browned out. This is a plant that gets as indignant as any
 hothouse ornamental if you demonstrate your willingness to cut
 away at it with some persistence. It enjoys thick mulches even
 less. Hell, I've killed some vines just by dropping scrap visqueen
 and tarps on them, which do the job in a season or two and can
 be hidden under mulch until removed. One big cluster of vines
 used to live under a spot where I subsequently stored a couple
 tons of cypress bark, but it didn't seem to thrive at all once
 it was under a few feet of slow-rotting mill byproduct ... --Muleskinner

<h>Never Burn Poison Ivy

<h> Bag the plants, roots and debris in plastic, then take to the
 dumpster or land fill. NEVER, NEVER, NEVER try to burn poison
 ivy out or add to a burn pile. Smoke can and will carry the
 poison. This does damage lung tissue and can lead to a long
 hospital visit or death. If you ever do burn out an area of
 brush, stay out of the smoke. There may be poison ivy that you
 don't see.

<h>Remove from other Items

<h> Hi,Just wanted to thank you profusely for your site. Tons of
 useful information (more than I got from WebMD.) Most useful
 were the pictures (instead of the illustrations you tend to
 find elsewhere) which helped me realize I had more than one
 kind/growing habit of poison ivy growing in my yard. It took
 awhile, but eventually I found possible ways of washing the
 oil off my upholstry (you can't exactly throw a possibly contaminated
 couch into the washing machine.) Perhaps, if you've the time,
 a "section" on removing the oil from more than your hands and
 clothing would be useful. And lastly, simply reading about others
 who have gone through the same suffering as much (and more)
 than I am, has helped mentally. Thanks again :-) and much praise
 for your site :-)--Heidi m., a sufferer in central New Jersey
 --"Heidi M." (workheidi@NOSPAMhotmail.com) submitted 2/Oct/2002Editor:
 I would think it would come off rather easily with any cleaner
 that is good with oil. Even plain old water. The problem with
 the skin is that once the oil bonds, it is very difficult to
 remove. Not a problem with furniture, tools, etc. Anyone else?
 

<h>Ammonium Sulfamate

<h> I'm fascinated that in all your site and the other sites you
 hotlink, there's absolutely no mention of ammonium sulfamate,
 sold under the trade name of ammate among others. My 'job' when
 visiting my grandparents in ipswich was to fill up the 2-gal
 pressure sprayer every morning and roam around their 75 ac looking
 for p.i., and I did that for many years. Like glyphosate, it
 needed several applications at two-week intervals, but in my
 experience it was very effective. I know enough chemstry to
 appreciate its relative safety, and in my experience it's extremely
 selective, killing only the p.i. I can remember spraying it
 on a vine growing through a highbush blueberry and seeing only
 the p.i. leaves wilt. I'm very !$!#!$ that it seems to be completely
 unavailable now - perhaps because it's too cheap and commodity-like
 to be profitable when glyphosate and triclopyr can be sold instead?
 I'm tempted to try making it. I don't think it'd be too hard.
 My other grandmother swore by phenolic soap ['fels naptha']
 for removing urushiol before the itch started, back in the '60s.
