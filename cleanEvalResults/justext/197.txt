 3, Why Slopes and More Math

<p> Here is a geometric story which describes the complex numbers,
 or what mathematicians since Gauss in the 1840's have regarded
 as the complex numbers. This geometric story provides a confirmation
 of the law of signs for real numbers. This first part of the
 story could be explain to someone familiar with arithmetic and
 the measurement of coordinates, rectangular and polar in the
 plane. The second part of this story is an exercise in trig.
 The second part appears in the next chapter.

<p>This first half assumes you have some familiarity with the measurement
 of distances and angles, with the addition of real numbers and
 points in the plane, and finally with multiplication of nonnegative
 (that is zero and positive) real numbers. 

<p>1. The immediate motivation for this approach (in this chapter)
 stems from three successive 1976 McGill University public lectures
 of the late Richard Feynman. He simply described physics as
 the addition and multiplication of arrows in the plane. He defined
 their multiplication as follows: add their angles and multiply
 their lengths. In terms of the polar coordinate [r1,q1] and
 [r2,q2] for the factors, the polar coordinates of the product
 is [r,q] = [r1r2,q1+q2] .) 

<p>All this was effectively presented to a general audience with
 no mention of vectors nor the Gauss-Argand representation of
 complex numbers. See the foreword. 

<p>2. In Morris Kline's three-volume work Mathematical Thought from
 Ancient to Modern Times, see in volume 2, Chapter 27, the third
 section called The Geometrical Representation of Complex Numbers.
 This section briefly describes the approach of Caspar Wessel
 (1745-1818). Part of Wessel's work (translated into English)
 is reproduced in David Eugene Smith's 1929 work A Source Book
 in Mathematics, Dover 1959 Reprint.

<h>Points in the Plane

<h>Addition

<p>The sum of two points with the rectangular coordinates (a,b)
 and (c,d) is given by (a+c,b+d). We therefore write 

<p>(a,b)+(b,d) = (a+c,c+d)

<p> For example (2,5)+(6,2) = (8,7). 

<p>In words, the addition rule is simple add the rectangular coordinates
 of the summands to get the rectangular coordinates of the sum.
 With this in mind, the following question is easy: What are
 the rectangular coordinates of the sum of (1,14) and (2,8)?
 Answer: (1,14)+(2,8) = (1+2,14+8) = (3,22). The chapter Arrow
 Addition discusses the addition of points or arrows in the plane
 further. 

<h>Multiplication

<p>Next we define using polar coordinates the product of two points
 in the plane. Each point or factor is located by means of angular
 displacement or rotation from the positive real axis, and also
 a nonnegative distance from the origin. The product of two points
 is given by a third point. Its angular displacement is the sum
 of the angular displacement of the factors. Its distance to
 the origin is the product of the distances of the factors. This
 is the add the angles and multiply the lengths rule. In polar
 coordinate notation, the multiplication rule and definition
 is indicated by 

<p>[r1,q1]·[r2,q2] = [r1r2,q1+q2]

<p> (As in the previous chapter, square brackets are used to indicate
 polar coordinates while round brackets indicate rectangular
 coordinates.) 

<p>Example. Two arrows are to be multiplied. One has length 1.3
 and angle 22.62°; the other factor has length 1.026 and angle
 46.97°; and so their product has length 1.3338 = 1.3·1.026 and
 angle 69.69° = 22.62°+46.97°; and that is it. See the following
 diagram. 

<p>Another Example. The product of the two points [3,80°] and [4,
 60°] is [(3)(4), 80°+ 60°] = [12,140°] 

<h>Stop For a Summary

<p>The addition of points in the plane is given by means of their
 rectangular coordinates while multiplication is given in terms
 of polar coordinates. It is an exercise in trig to obtain expressions
 for the rectangular coordinates of a product in terms of the
 rectangular coordinates of the factors. See the next chapter.
 (Note that while your reading of this chapter requires a mastery
 of the algebraic way of writing and thinking, you could explain
 with diagrams and examples only, the ideas in this chapter to
 someone without this mastery. It is the on-paper communication
 which requires the mastery.) 

<h>Introducing the Complex Numbers

<p>Points in the plane with the operations of addition and multiplication
 just given are called the complex numbers. The plane with these
 two operations on its points is called the complex numbers plane,
 or more briefly the complex numbers. 

<p>We will now change to a more standard notation for them. We may
 and often will write the rectangular coordinates z = (a,b) as
 z = a+ib, We will further call the abscissa a, the real part
 of the complex number z = a+ib. We will also call the ordinate
 b, the imaginary part of the complex number z = a+ib. 

<p>We will say that the complex number z = a+ib is purely imaginary
 when its real part a = 0. The angle of a purely imaginary complex
 number z = a+ib = 0+ib = (0,b) is 90 degrees or 270 degrees
 (modulo 

<p> FOOTNOTE: Two quantities x and y are equal modulo a third quantity
 c, if and only if their difference x-y = kc for some whole number
 or integer k. 

<p> 360 degrees), depending on the sign of the imaginary part b.
 When b &gt; 0, the angle is 90 degrees (modulo 360 degrees).
 When b &lt; 0, the angle is 270 degrees (modulo 360 degrees).
 

<p>We will also say that z = a+ib is (purely) real when its imaginary
 part b is zero. The angle of a (purely) real complex number
 z = a+ib = a+i0 = (a,0) is 0 degrees or 180 degrees (modulo
 360 degrees), depending on the sign of the real part a. If a
 &gt; 0, this angle is 0 degrees (modulo 360 degrees) while if
 a &gt; 0, this angle is 180 degrees (modulo 360 degrees). 

<h>Real Numbers as Complex Numbers

<p>Each complex number z = a+i0 with imaginary part zero gives and
 is given by a real number a. We will write z = a in this situation,
 and say that the complex number z is also a real number. 

<p>With this practice, the real numbers can be regarded as a subset
 of the complex numbers; and the real number line can be identified
 with the horizontal axis of the plane. 

<h>Confirmation of The Law of Signs

<p>We identify the real number line with the horizontal axis of
 the plane. With this identification, observe that positive numbers
 have angular displacement zero, modulo 360 degrees. Also observe
 that negative numbers have angular displacement 180 degrees,
 modulo 360 degrees. The magnitude of a real number is its distance
 to the origin. 

<p>Suppose z = a+i0 and w = c+i0. We want to compute the product
 zw with the multiply the lengths, add the angles rule. Each
 factor has length |a| or |c|. Each factor has angle 0 or 180
 degrees (modulo 360 degrees). The relationships

<l>0° = 0°+0°

<l>180° = 0°+180° = 180°+0°

<l>360° = 180°+180° = 0° (modulo 360°)

<l> imply the add the angles, multiply the lengths rule for the
 multiplication of complex numbers agrees with the ordinary method
 for multiplying real numbers and the law of signs. The relationship
 in particular imply 

<l>(+1) = (+1)(+1) as 0° = 0°+0° 

<l>(-1) = (+1)(-1) = (-1)(+1) as 180° = 0°+180° = 180°+0°

<l>(-1)(-1) = (+1) as 360° = 180°+180°

<l> Examples and then some further comments may reinforce these
 ideas. For the first example, the number 4 is now identified
 with the point (4,0) = [4,0°] = [4,360°]. This number or point
 has distance 4 to the origin and angle of 0°, modulo 360 degrees,
 with the horizontal axis: 

<p>
For the second example, the number -2 is identified with the
 point (-2,0) = [2,180°]. See the figure below. 

<p>Now multiplying the point [2,180°] by itself leads to the product
 [2,180°]2 = [22,180°+180°] = [4,360°] = [4,0°]. Thus the point
 on the horizontal axis identified with -2 when squared gives
 the point identified with +4 indicated above. The 360 degrees
 in the diagram for the number or point 4 = (4,0) represents
 the doubling of the angle 180 degrees. 

<p>For an example or exercise, compute the pairwise products of
 3=3+0i, 4=4+0i, -3=-3+i0 and -4=-4+0i using the add the angles,
 multiply the lengths rule. 

<p>Remark. The add the angles, multiply the length rule could be
 used to define the product of real numbers to people/students
 who know (a) about the addition of real numbers or coordinates
 and (b) about the multiplication of non-negative numbers. They
 would not need to have any previous knowledge of the law of
 signs.

<p>
 FOOTNOTE: The add the angles, multiple the lengths rule for
 the multiplication of complex numbers thus yields a rule for
 the multiplication of real numbers once the multiplication of
 positive numbers with themselves or zero is understood/defined.
 

<p>More Exercises. Compute the following using the multiply the
 lengths, add the angles rule: 

<p>  

<l>A = (1.5)·(2). 

<l>B = (1.5)·(-2). 

<l>C = (-1.5)·(-2).

<l>D = (1.5)·(-2).

<l>E = [10,45°] ·[[1/20],15°].

<l> Note each factor gives a point or arrow in the coordinate plane.
 

<p>Stop For A Summary. The polar coordinate definition 

<p>[r1,q1]·[r2,q2] = [r1r2,q1+q2]

<p> of the product of two point in the plane, involves the multiplication
 of lengths (= distances to the origin) and the addition of angles.
 For points on the horizontal axis, the angles of the factors
 are zero or 180° (modulo 360°). Computing the angle of the product
 will involve one of the following expressions: 

<p>0°+0°

<p>=

<p>0°

<p>0°+180°

<p>=

<p>180°

<p>180°+0°

<p>=

<p>180°

<p>180°+180°

<p>=

<p>360°

<p> Since the angle 180 degrees is associated with -1, and the angles
 0 and 360 degrees are both associated with the number +1, the
 polar coordinate definition of multiplication of points in the
 plane agrees with (or yields) the law of signs for the multiplication
 of positive and negative numbers. 

<h>Square Root of -1

<p>The real number -1 = -1+0i = [1,180°] has angle 180 degrees (mod
 360 degrees) and length 1. The purely imaginary number (0,1)
 = 0+i1 = [1,90°] has angle 90 degrees and length 1. Multiplying
 this point or number by itself, that is, squaring it, gives
 the point with length 1 ×1 = 1 and angle 90°+90° = 180°. So
 the product equals -1+0i = -1. We call i = the principal square
 root of -1. 

<p>A second square root of -1 is obtained as follows. The imaginary
 number (0,-1) = 0+i(-1) = [1,-90°] has angle -90 degrees and
 length 1. Multiplying this point or number by itself, that is
 squaring it, gives the point with length 1 times 1 =1 and angle
 (-90°)+(-90°) = -180° = 180° (mod 360°). So this product equals
 -1+0i = -1 as well. 

<p>
This provides two square roots of -1 as both [1,+90°]2 = [1,+180°]
 = -1 and [1,-90°]2 = [1,-180°] = -1. 

<h>Square Roots of Other Complex Numbers

<p>The square root of a positive number or zero are real nonnegative
 numbers. I assume in the following that you know how to compute
 these square roots. The square roots of negative numbers and
 of other arrows or points in the coordinate plane depend on
 this ability. 

<p>Observe that squaring points in the plane doubles their angular
 displacements and squares their magnitudes (distance to the
 origin). That is, the add the angles, multiple the lengths rule
 gives 

<p>[r½,

<p>12

<p>q]·[r½,

<p>12

<p>q] = [r ,q]

<p> Therefore the arrow [r½,[1/2]q] when squared (meaning multiplied
 by itself) yields [r,q] . So it is called a square root of the
 arrow [r,q]. Another square root is located by the polar coordinates
 [r½,[1/2]q+180°] since [r,q] = [r,q+360°] both locate the same
 point in the plane. You should consider the special case of
 positive numbers z = a+i0 = [a,0°] where the angle q = 0 degrees.
 

<p>Exercises.

<l>Find all the square roots of 4 and -4 and plot them.

<l>Find the cube roots of 27 and -27 and plot them in the plane.

<l>Find the square roots of \cis(45°) = cos(45°)+isin(45°) = [1,45°].

<h>Complex Conjugates

<p>The complex conjugate of a complex number z = a+bi with polar
 coordinates r = Ö[(a2+b2)] and q is the complex number [`(z)]
 = a-bi with polar coordinates r and -q. 

<p>*   Exercise. Show multiplying a complex number a+bi by its conjugate
 a-bi gives the nonnegative number r2 = a2+b2. 

<p>  

<h>
Conjugates and Reciprocals

<p> = [[1/(r)],-q] by z = [r,q] gives the complex number [1,0] with
 length 1 and angle 0, that is, the real number 1. And multiplication
 of any point (c,d) by 1 = [1,0°] yields back the point (c,d)
 

<p>The reciprocal (or multiplicative inverse) of the complex number
 z = a+bi with length r &gt; 0 and angle q is the complex number
 p

<p> with length 1/r and angle -q.

<p> 

<p>
Observe that if r &gt; 1 then the length of the reciprocal [1/(r)]
 &lt; 1 &lt; r, that is, the length of the reciprocal is less
 than 1 and the length of the original number. In contrast, if
 0 &lt; r &lt; 1 then [1/(r)] &gt; 1 &gt; r. Question: Which
 of these two cases is represented in the above diagram? What
 happens in the case r = 1? 

<h>Two Algebraic Properties

<h> Observe

<h>Real Multiples of Arrows

<h> We said earlier (in the last section of the chapter Arrow Addition)
 for real numbers a, b and c that c·(a,b) = (ca,cb) without any
 reference to or use of the add the angles, multiply the lengths
 arrow multiplication rule. But c = c+i0 = (c,0) gives a point
 in the plane. So we can multiple c = c+i0 = (c,0) and (a,b)
 = [r,q] using the add the angles, multiply the lengths rule.
 Two cases, more precisely possibilities, will be examined. 

<p>Case 1:c³ 0 Observe for c &gt; 0 that c = c+i0 = [c,0] has angle
 0 degrees and length c = |c|. Thus the add the angles, multiply
 the lengths multiplication rule yields 

<p>c·(a,b) = [c,0]·[r,q] = [cr,0+q] = [cr,q] = (ca,cb)

<p> as before. 

<p>Case 2: c &lt; 0 Now c = -d &lt; 0. But d &gt; 0 implies 

<p>(d,0)·(a,b) = [d,0]·[r,q] = [dr,q] = (da,db)

<p> Therefore 

<p>(c,0)·(a,b)

<p>=

<p>(-1)·[d,0]·(a,b) = (-1)·[dr,q]

<p>=

<p>[dr,q+180°] = (-da,-db)

<p>=

<p>(ca,cb)

<p> again. 

<p>Conclusion. Multiplication of a point (a,b) by a real number
 c = c+i0 with and without the add the angles, multiple the lengths
 rule gives (ca,cb). 

<h>Some Vocabulary.

<h> For each point or complex number z = a+bi = (a,b) = [r,q] in
 this plane, we say that a is the real part of z; that b is the
 imaginary part of z;that r = |z| = Ö[(a2+b2)] is the magnitude,
 modulus or absolute value of z(different texts prefer different
 terms); and that q is the angle or argument of z. 

<p>Remark. The use of round brackets () in the notation for rectangular
 coordinates (a,b) stems from the convention in many algebra
 texts written before this one. The use of square bracket []
 in the notation for polar coordinates [r,q] here was chosen
 simply because the square brackets were available. In retrospect,
 cosmetic appearance alone would suggest the employment of round-brackets
 for polar coordinates and square brackets for rectangular coordinates.
 The development of notation is not always cosmetically optimal.
