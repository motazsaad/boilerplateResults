<p>Physics Run plan for 1010719, MP 287 Asdex H-mode similarity
 experiment

<p>
Goal: To make high density, high power EDA H-modes in a shape
 identical to
that in ASDEX-Upgrade 'Type II ELM' discharges.
 This regime,
which was only recently obtained on AUG, appears
 rather similar to that
obtained on C-Mod when power is increased
 into EDA H-modes. At reduced powers,
AUG sometimes sees a 'quasi-coherent'
 mode. We would like to see if the same
behaviour is observed
 on the two machines with the same dimensionless
parameters.
 We will obtain edge profiles both at threshold and in the steady
H-mode
 period. AUG will then try to match the
dimensionless parameters
 (nu*,beta, rho*) of these discharges.

<p>
Plan:

<p>
1) Obtain suitable shape, plasma parameters. Start with shape
 from shot
1010605016. Raise Ip to 1.0 MA, keep Bt at 5.3 T.
 L-mode nel=1.1e20 m-2.
 Once plasma is obtained, adjust shape
 to get a better match to AUG pulse 14265.
This will involve
 increasing the inner gap and the radius of the x-point.
RF should
 use these shots (3-4?) to tune and condition;
For the last shot
 we would like a power ramp up to >~2 MW to get the
threshold
 power, and both L and H-mode tunes.

<p>
2) High power EDAs. Use square wave RF pulse at Ptot=2.5 MW
 using D and E at
80 MHz (more if we can get it). Measure pedestals,
 and fluctuations.
Tune J-port at low power on these.

<p>
3) Add power from J-port (70 MHz), at maximum available power.
 This will be
off-axis, which is non-optimal, but should help
 to raise pedestal temperature. 

<p>
4) Increase density. A dimensionless match to the best AUG 'grassy
 ELM' shots
would correspond to a line integrated density of
 4.7e20, higher than our usual
range. Increase starting density,
 and probably puff gas into EDA, to see how
high we can get and
 still maintain a decent, steady H-mode (and couple enough
power).
 ECE will probably be cut off, so good ETS data are essential.
Again,
 use max available power without and with J-port.

<p>
4) Once the 'high density' H-mode has been characterized, use
 a slow power
ramp to determine the corresponding threshold power
 and edge parameters.

 and edge parameters.

<p>
Results:

<p>
We had limited success with this run, primarily due to poor
 machine conditions.
This was probably a result of the recent
 vent, combined with the fact that we
were running non-standard
 shapes, and thus putting power on different vessel
surfaces.
 This led to impurity injections and, most critically, to a high
hydrogen
 fraction (up to 20%) which limited the RF power absorption;
 H/D
typically increases during each discharge, with Pabs decreasing.

<p>
The shape development part of the run went quite smoothly, and
 we
did get shots which were a very close match to ASDEX Upgrade
 shapes (see
physics operator summary for details of changes
 made). These had elongation
close to our vertical stability
 limits (k~1.73), and were close to double null,
which may have
 caused some interaction with upper vessel surfaces, and possibly

 also increased H-mode thresholds. The last AUG shaped shot,
 1010719020, is a
good example (Delta_u=0.34, delta_l= 0.47)

<p>
J-port was not available for the run after all, so we ran with
 typically 2.3
MW at 80 MHz from D and E port antennas. However,
 the low absorption means
that the effective power was actually
 much lower, especially late in the pulse.
We were unable to
 get any H-modes which had a steady, EDA character. Many were
ELM-free,
 with strongly increasing impurities. (eg. shot 2, 14). Others,
 with
lower power and higher radiation, had periodic behaviour
 typical of Type III
ELMs; the pedestal was very cold (eg. shots
 5,13). On shots 9 and 11 we ramped
the RF up slowly to get threshold
 data, and found it was over the 2.3 MW
injected); this is very
 high for these C-Mod conditions. Making the discharge
more 'single
 null' had little effect (shot 12). Lowering the target density
from
 nel= 0.9 to 0.7e20 m-2, while it had minimal effect on nebar
 at the RF
onset (1.35-1.4e20m-3 in both cases), resulted in
 much lower neutral pressure
anda threshold of Prf=1.13 MW (shot
 13). This may be a good point for threshold
comparison, though
 it was rather early in the ramp. Shot 14 had full RF power
at
 this density, and resulted in ELM-free H-modes.

<p>
In an attempts to favour the EDA regime, Ip was lowered from
 1.0 to 0.9 MA from
shot 15 on. This raised q95 to 4.2. The rates
 of density rise did decrease
slightly, though not an obvious
 EDA regime. Shot 16 had hints of a weak
quasi-coherent
mode
 on PCI. Shot 17 was colder and more ELMy. From shot 19 Bt was
 raised
from 5.3 T to 5.6 T, raising q95 still further and a
 better match to the AUG
target. This proved more difficult for
 the RF to match, for reasons not well
understood at least by
 me, and power was not as steady as the rest of the day.
The
 density did appear to be getting more steady, and QC modes characteristic
of
 EDA were seen on PCI. Shot 21, about 0.75-0.8 secs, may be a
 good time for
pedestal analysis. For shot 22, we went back to
 a standard shape, 800 kA shot
to check we could get EDA there.
 We did, but it quickly cooled and reverted to
Type III ELMs
 as H/D rose.

<p>
In summary, as expected, it was more difficult to get steady
 H-modes in the
lower triangularity ASDEX-Upgrade shape. However,
 the poor machine conditions
and low absorbed power undoubtedly
 were a major impediment, and there were
indications we were
 getting close. There was insufficient power to try raising
the
 density. Since the discharge development has been successfully
 completed,
we would very much like to revisit this experiment
 on a day with better vessel
conditions and all three RF antennas
 available.

<p>
H/D getting to 10%, and second half of flat-top is L-mode, indicating
 poor
heating and/or high radiation.
For next shot, increase
 outer gap.

Better; makes it to 1.47
 secs. Three H-modes, and the third is quite steady.
However,
 H/D at this point is 20%, radiation is high and net power therefore
presumably
 very low.

<p>
Pedestal Te ~ 200 eV; may be in an intermittent ELMy/EDA regime.

For next shot, try to increase RF power. Asked Stu Zweben to
 delay D2 puffing
to 1.4 secs.

 Two H-modes, not EDA. Both end due to rapid increase
of Prad.

 period.

 also see if
injections are related to
Prf.

Try backing off on density, replace ~200 kW of D-port power
 by E-port in case
it is contributing to the

Steady RF on this one,
 2.2 MW. For some reason H-modes are shorter, accumulate
more

Nel was 0.75-1.84x10^20

At slightly higher nel
 0.87-1.9x10^20 m-2, got into a series of ELMy periods.
Temperatures,

 due to high H/D.

q95.

Still a lot of RF trips.
 Two H-modes. The first has a steadier density,
though conditions
 never get
quite stationary. Period 0.75-0.8 secs is fairly steady,
 may be good to look
at pedestal parameters.
QC mode appears
 during this window too (on PCI)

<p>
For next shot, load a standard C-Mod shape from 1010716004,
 780 kA, 5.36 T, to
see if we get back
a good EDA.

reload of 1010716004 (780

<p>
Summary
_______

<p>
Shapes that are an excellent match to the scaled AUG shape were
obtained
 (e.g. 21) and many were run. A comparison plot is in 
user10:[hutch.ps]aug_match.ps.
 They are close to double null;
although a range of three sseps
 was run without obvious effect on the
plasma character. No solid
 EDA H-modes were obtained. The H/D was high
and rose strongly
 with RF in the early part of the day. Later on, the
rises seemed
 less significant, but in all cases the H/D was above 10%
during
 much of the RF pulse. Heating was clearly inefficient in many
cases.
 In some others heating was ok even at high H/D.

<p>
The early part of the day was plagued with injections. Many
 appeared
to be caused by visible sparks on the upper left corner
 of D-antenna.
Some others were not RF induced. As the day wore
 on, these problems 
were less severe, and the plasma ran reasonably
 reliably.

<p>
These shapes are fairly close to stability limits. One or two
 VDEs were
experienced. The chopper V was set to 150 to 200 instead
 of the usual 0
to lower the operating average current to a position
 closer to the center
of its range. This adjustment seemed to
 be a significant improvement in 
that it allowed operation with
 an elongation that gave rise to noisy chopper
behaviour without
 leading to saturations and subsequent VDE.

<p>
A manual gas puff during the RF did not significantly improve
 the 
operation, but also did not seem to give much impact on
 the RF coupling
despite a x2 rise in main chamber neutral pressure.

<p>
It appears to be confirmed that the lower triangularity that
 is needed to
match AUG makes it harder to get into EDA. The
 high H level was also 
definitely a handicap.
