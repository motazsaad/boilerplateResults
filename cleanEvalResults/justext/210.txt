<p>Summary: Studies show that reactions of top people in sport are
 faster than consciousness can register. How can you get to such
 a lightning reflex? Richard Passingham, Professor of Psychology
 at Oxford describes some remarkable experiments. 

<p>Transcript:Robyn Williams: Have you checked the whereabouts of
 your left leg recently? Does it have a mind of its own like
 Peter Sellers’ arm in Dr Strangelove, always trying to give
 the Nazi salute irrespective of its owner’s intentions. Intention,
 that’s the word for this evening’s conversation. It’s with Professor
 Dick Passingham who’s a psychologist at Oxford and who likes
 to play tricks on us and our limbs, to see how the brain controls
 them. Or doesn’t – like when you think your arm or leg belongs
 to someone else. 

<p>
Do you believe for example that you could be tricked into thinking
 that a dummy arm is actually your own? It’s something Professor
 Passingham does all the time.

<p>Richard Passingham: It’s an illusion that was discovered by a
 man called Bogunovic in America and he was interested as we
 are in how we know that our body belongs to ourselves because
 there are patients who actually with particular lesions in their
 brain think that the left hand side of their body belongs to
 somebody else.

<p>
The illusion involves the following. You have your arm, your
 right arm, under cover and on top of it a rubber arm. It’s a
 prosthetic arm so it looks very like a real arm and normally
 of course you would know perfectly well that the prosthetic
 arm doesn’t belong to you. And what he discovered is that if
 you use paint brushes, one to brush your real arm under the
 cover and one visibly to brush the rubber arm, after about ten
 seconds or so you get the illusion that the rubber arm belongs
 to yourself. And it’s so remarkable that you even think that
 if you were to move a finger that visible finger of the rubber
 arm would move.

<p>Robyn Williams: And do you feel the tickle?

<p>Richard Passingham: Oh you feel the tickle of course. It really
 feels as if it’s on your real arm. The illusion happens because
 there’s a conflict – on the one hand you can feel your real
 arm and you know where it is but on the other hand you see the
 brush on the rubber arm at the same time as you feel it on your
 real arm so there’s a conflict. And the brain resolves this
 conflict by actually making you think that the rubber arm belongs
 to yourself.

<p>Robyn Williams: So how did you use this illusion as part of your
 investigation?

<p>Richard Passingham: Well I was working with Henry Kerson who
 comes from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden who’s now one
 of the members of my group and as always I’m interested in letting
 young people follow their own course and he wanted to follow
 up how we have this self concept. Our belief that we know the
 difference between our arm and somebody elses. So what we did
 was we used scanners. These may well now be familiar to your
 listeners using a magnetic resonance scanner we can now image
 activity in the brain while somebody lies in our scanner. So
 what we did is we got hold of oh I think about 20 people and
 we found out how many of them actually felt the illusion strongly.
 We put them in the scanner and we arranged their heads so that
 they could see the rubber arm directly, we didn’t use a mirror,
 their head was slightly tilted up so that they could see their
 arm. And then we carried out the experiment exactly as Bogonovic
 had, that is we synchronously brushed both the real arm underneath
 the cover and the rubber arm which the person can see happening.

<p>
Now to do the experiment we made use of the fact that there
 are two conditions in which you don’t feel the illusion. One
 is if the brush doesn’t happen synchronously, if in other words,
 you’re brushing out of synch the real arm and the rubber arm
 then you don’t feel the illusion. And there’s another condition
 in which you don’t feel the illusion and that’s if you have
 the rubber arm pointing the wrong way so that its fingers are
 pointing towards your shoulders. So we could look for where
 is the activity in the brain when you do feel the illusion compared
 with these two control conditions.

<p>Robyn Williams: And what did you find?

<p>Richard Passingham: Well we found that the area that showed the
 strongest activity related to the illusion was an area called
 the pre-motor cortex which is part of your motor system and
 it’s an important area because it receives information from
 all the senses. So it receives both tactile information and
 about the position of your arm and it also receives visual information.
 And this area was active only in the condition in which you
 felt the illusion, only after you began to feel the illusion
 and remarkably the more strongly you felt the illusion the more
 strongly this area was active. We got the people to rate the
 strength of the illusion in various ways and as I say there
 was very close relation between how strongly they felt the illusion
 and how active this area was.

<p>Robyn Williams: And when you were going outside the conventional
 reaction where you actually have a successful illusion when
 in fact you had the arm going the other way, what happened in
 the brain?

<p>Richard Passingham: Then we found no activity in this area at
 all, these were controlled conditions in which as you say the
 subjects felt no illusion and there was no activity in the pre-motor
 cortex at all. And this is what tells us that the critical area
 for multi-sensory integration that is for the putting together
 of sensory information is in fact the pre-motor cortex. And
 we take it that the way in which you know that your arm belongs
 to you and not to somebody else is that you get both visual
 information about your arm and you get tactile or touch information
 about your arm and normally these are congruent. They tell you
 the same thing and they tell you that that’s your arm. But in
 this case where there’s a conflict then vision dominates.

<p>Robyn Williams: OK, so bring in the people who’ve got this misfortune
 where they can’t actually recognise their limb how does your
 study affect understanding what’s going on with them?

<p>Richard Passingham: Well the demonstration of people who think
 that their left arm belongs to somebody else has best been done
 by a method called the sodium amatol method. You inject sodium
 amatol into the right middle cerebral artery and this is done
 only in patients who are getting ready for surgery and it’s
 done not for experimental purposes but it’s done to tell you
 important things about where language is represented in these
 people’s brains. Now when you inject sodium amatol into the
 right hemisphere your left arm becomes paralysed and falls from
 a position as you are asked to hold it upright, it falls down
 onto the bed covers, you’re awake at the time. If you then ask
 the people if their arm is OK, they say yes, my arm’s fine.
 And then if you ask them whose arm is that many of them say
 it’s somebody else’s which is a quite remarkable finding.

<p>
Now in the sodium amatol case the amatol is injected into the
 blood supply and infuses through much of the right hemisphere
 of the brain. So that doesn’t tell you anything about the localisation
 of activity which is why you want to scan because if you scan,
 you can find out which are the critical areas for any particular
 phenomenon. Now in our experiments we found two areas in particular,
 the parietal cortex and the pre-motor cortex. The parietal cortex
 was more active both when the arm was pointing forwards and
 also when the brush strokes were synchronised. But the area
 that was most critical in the sense that it only showed up in
 the one condition in which you felt the illusion was as I say
 the pre-motor cortex. So what this adds is strong information
 about the location of areas, which are critical for the phenomena
 observed in the clinic.

<p>Robyn Williams: Having found those locations can it enable you
 to help the patients so that they can find their limbs again?

<p>Richard Passingham: We haven’t yet got anywhere on that. Now
 there are other examples where illusions have done that. The
 well-known neuroscientist Ramachandran has been interested in
 an allusion by which if your arm is cut off, let’s say from
 the elbow let’s say due to an accident you may go on feeling
 your forearm and you may think it’s there. And this is an illusion
 because the arm isn’t there and there’s been a lot of interest
 in why you feel this illusion. And he’s indeed scanned people
 using a method called magneto encephalography to see what’s
 happening in their brain under this illusion. But then being
 the ingenious man he is he’s gone on to think of ways in which
 he might treat people and he’s done this using mirrors.

<p>Robyn Williams: And in those experiments Dick Passingham was
 just referring to Dr Ramachandran showed the patients themselves
 in a mirror and told them that their real arm, not the amputated
 arm, was the one that felt the pain and treated them normally
 and the pain went away. The brain in other words believed the
 mirror trick and you may have heard Rama as he’s know talking
 to Natasha Mitchell on All in the Mind on ABC Radio National
 a couple of weeks ago about this.

<p>
Well Professor Richard Passingham is using scanners to help
 solve another problem, that of intention. Imagine facing Bret
 Lee bowling super fast and how quickly you need to respond with
 a cricket bat. In fact it’s quicker than the brain seems to
 be able to handle yet it does so – how?

<p>Richard Passingham: Well the interest of the difference between
 automatic actions and those that we think about is being central
 to our research. Philosophers have for a long time said that
 they think voluntary actions are preceded by an intention and
 the very well known psychologist and philosopher William James
 early in the century or at the end of the last century in his
 classic book talked about these as willed actions. The suggestion
 being that they are preceded by an act of will. Now it’s been
 very difficult to do research on that but in a classic experiment
 carried out in 1983 the neuroscientist Benjamin Libet thought
 of a way of actually timing when you feel the intention.

<p>
Now he did this using a clock face. So the person is sitting
 there and in front of them is a clock and a spot is going round
 the outside of the clock fairly quickly, rotating round. The
 person is then asked simply to move their forefinger whenever
 they want. They might do it after 15 seconds, or 9 seconds or
 3 seconds it’s up to them; a typical voluntary action. What
 he then did was ask the people when they felt the intention
 to move they should remember where the spot was on the clock
 face and that tells you when they were first aware of their
 intention to move. Now his classic finding and the one that
 puzzled people was that you can record electrical activity from
 the brain from the scalp using either EEG or electro encephalograph
 about a second before a voluntary action – it can be more. But
 people normally report the intention to move about 200 milliseconds
 before they move. So the puzzle is that the brain seems to be
 getting ready to move really some time before we are aware that
 we are going to move and that we have the intention.

<p>
So that’s the phenomenon that we’ve made use of in an experiment
 working in Oxford. What we did was scan people and in our experiment
 on some trials they timed when they intended to move and on
 some trials they times when they actually made the movement.
 So now we can compare activity when the subject’s attention
 is directed to their intention with the activity when they are
 just attending to the movement itself. And what we found was
 that there was enhanced activity in an area called the pre-supplementary
 motor area which lies on the inner surface of the brain, increased
 activity there when you attended to your intention. Now the
 interesting thing is that it had been thought that the electrical
 activity that you can record using the EEG before movement has
 its origin in this area though that had never been proved. So
 what we’ve shown is that indeed your intention occurs in the
 same area in which the electrical activity occurs about a second
 before movement.

<p>
What it seems to show is this: Actually the origin of the movement
 is unconscious, you’re not aware of it, it’s occurring well
 before the time of which you’re aware. Now that you are aware
 about 200 milliseconds before movement appears to be because
 the activity is enhanced and there seems to be a rule that if
 we are to be aware of representations in the brain the activity
 needs to be enhanced. So it looks as if the original direction
 for the movement is unconsciously performed by the brain and
 then we become aware of it and that’s the time when we say we
 intend it. So you might then say well what’s the point of awareness?
 And it’s been suggested by many that the point might be that
 there’s still time to change the movement or indeed to veto
 it and that was proposed by Benjamin Libet. 

<p>
But what really this is relevant for is the whole issue of how
 much of our mental activity we’re aware of? And if you consider
 for example sportsman, cricketers, a batsman reacting to a bowler
 or a tennis player reacting to a serve then actually it’s been
 shown that the activity that leads to them responding is activity
 of which they are not aware – they don’t know how they do it.
 And we now think that much of our mental activity occurs below
 the level of consciousness.

<p>Robyn Williams: Now if you take Viv Richards who’s the quickest
 natural player I can think of to get to that point where your
 reaction is right, in other words it’s appropriate, long before
 you can know enough about where the bowler’s going to sling
 the ball, presumably you fine tune, you practice enables you
 to have an unconscious reflex if you like in advance so that
 you get it right more often than you get it wrong?

<p>Richard Passingham: Well we’ve been interested in that and what
 we’ve done is take the case of piano playing. If you play the
 piano you’re aware that at first when you learn the piece you
 have to attend very hard and you’re aware of what you’re doing,
 you know which fingers you’re moving and you are sight reading
 and it takes a lot of your attention. But after practising for
 many, many hours you can now play the piece automatically and
 you can, in fact, play it while holding a conversation; you
 don’t have to attend to what your fingers are doing. So we’ve
 actually scanned people again using FMRI and we scanned people
 while they were learning a sequence of finger movements. And
 what we found was that at first the prefrontal cortex, which
 you could regard as the top of the hierarchy of information
 processing, the prefrontal cortex is very active indeed. But
 when the task has become automatic and the sequence is under
 your belt and you don’t have to think about it then there’s
 no longer activity in the prefrontal cortex. So that raises
 the question well what areas are active when the task has become
 automatic? And one of the areas that’s active, though not the
 only one, is the cerebellum which lies in the hind brain. Now
 the cerebellum is very enlarged in the human brain and is involved
 in the learning of skills and motor skills, there’s much evidence
 for that.

<p>
And what we found was that when the task had become very automatic
 there was activity in the cerebellum and the areas that are
 connected to it. So I assume that what Viv Richards has done
 over very, very many years is go from having activity in his
 prefrontal cortex as he thinks about what he’s doing until it
 becomes automatic and you no longer have to think about it and
 it’s then performed by other areas of the brain. And if you
 think Donald Bradman as I remember as a young man used to throw
 a cricket ball at a wire and this way by repeated practice he
 got to be able to throw without thinking and a cricketer can
 throw at the bails simply without thinking. And in the lab you
 can show that you’re not thinking by asking the person when
 they are carrying out the task to do another task at the same
 time. We’ve done that and when you learn the motor sequence
 you’re very disturbed in learning it if you have to carry out
 another task whereas when the task is automatic you can do something
 else at the same time without interference.

<p>Robyn Williams: So that’s how we do it every day, almost without
 thinking. Aren’t we clever. Richard Passisngham is Professor
