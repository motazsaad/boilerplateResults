<p>EYVIND grew and became an active boy: at school he was amongst
 the first, and he was capable at his work at home. That was
 because at home he was fond of his mother and at school he was
 fond of his master. His father he saw but little, for he was
 either away fishing or else he was looking after their mill,
 where half the parish had their grinding done.

<p>  The thing which most influenced his mind during these years
 was the schoolmaster&#146;s history, which his mother told him
 one evening as they sat by the fire. It ran through all his
 books, it underlay every word the schoolmaster said; he felt
 it in the air of the schoolroom when all was quiet. It filled
 him with obedience and respect, and gave him a quicker apprehension,
 as it were, of all that was taught him. This was the story:

<p>  Baard was the schoolmaster&#146;s name and he had a brother
 called Anders. They were very fond of each other; both enlisted,
 lived in town together, and were together in the war, when they
 both became corporals and served in the same company. When,
 after the war, they came home again, everybody thought them
 two stalwart fellows. Then their father died. He had a good
 deal of loose property which was difficult to divide evenly,
 so they said to each other that they would not fall out about
 it, but would put up the things to auction so that each could
 buy what he wished and then they would share the proceeds. So
 said so done. But their father possessed a large gold watch
 which was widely renowned, for it was the only gold watch people
 in those parts had ever seen. When this watch was put up many
 rich people tried for it, until the brothers, too, began to
 bid; then the others gave way. Now Baard expected Anders to
 let him get the watch, and Anders expected the same of Baard;
 each made his bid in turn to prove the other, and they looked
 across at each other whilst they bid. When the watch had got
 up to twenty dollars Baard felt it was not nice of his brother
 to bid against him, and kept on bidding until it got towards
 thirty dollars. As Anders still did not give in, it seemed to
 Baard that Anders neither remembered how good he had been to
 him, nor yet that he was the eldest. The watch got over thirty
 dollars, and Anders still kept on. Then Baard ran the watch
 up to forty dollars in one bid, and no longer looked at his
 brother. It was very quiet in the auction-room; only the bailiff
 quietly repeated the figures. Anders thought as he stood there
 that if Baard could afford to give forty dollars he could too,
 and if Baard grudged him the watch he would have to take it;
 so out-bid him. This seemed to Baard the greatest slight that
 had ever been put upon him; he bid fifty dollars, quite softly.
 A great many people were standing round, and Anders thought
 he must not let his brother thus put him to shame in everybody&#146;s
 hearing, so he bid over him. Then Baard laughed: &#147;A hundred
 dollars and my brotherhood into the bargain,&#148; said he;
 turned, and went out of the room. Some one presently came out
 to him whilst he was busy saddling the horse he had bought just
 before.

<p>  The moment Baard heard this a sort of remorse fell upon him;
 he thought of his brother and not of the watch. The saddle was
 on, but he paused with his hand on the horse&#146;s back, uncertain
 whether he should start. Then a lot of people came out, Anders
 amongst them; and so soon as he saw his brother standing there
 by the saddled horse not knowing what was in Baard&#146;s mind,
 he called out to him:

<p>  &#147;Nor yet on the day when I ride home again,&#148; answered
 Baard, with a white face, as he mounted his horse. The house
 in which they had lived with their father, neither of them entered
 again.

<p>  In the first year of Anders&#146; marriage the only cow he
 possessed was found dead by the north wall of the house, where
 it was tethered; and nobody could make out what it had died
 of. Several misfortunes followed, and he went down in the world;
 but the worst was when in mid-winter his barn was burnt with
 all that was in it; nobody knew how the fire broke out.

<p>  With Baard things had gone in this wise. So soon as he heard
 that his brother was in distress his heart melted towards him,
 but pride kept him back. He felt himself much drawn towards
 the church, and there he formed good resolutions, but he had
 not the strength to carry them out. He often set forth and came
 within sight of the house, but now some one came out of the
 door, now there was a stranger there, or Anders was out chopping
 wood; so that there was always something in the way. One Sunday
 in midwinter, however, he was once more at church and Anders
 was there too. Baard saw him; he had grown pale and thin, he
 wore the same clothes as when they were together, but now they
 were old and ragged. During the sermon he looked up at the pastor,
 and it seemed to Baard that he was kind and gentle. He remembered
 their childhood and what a good boy he was. Baard himself took
 the Sacrament that day, and he made the solemn promise before
 his God that, come what might, he would be reconciled to his
 brother. This purpose penetrated his soul just as he drank the
 wine, and when he rose he intended to go straight over and sit
 down beside him, but some one was sitting in the way and his
 brother did not look up. After service there were still difficulties:
 there were too many people about; his brother&#146;s wife was
 walking by his side and he did not know her. He thought it would
 be best to go to his house and have a serious talk with him.
 When evening came he did so. He went right up to the door and
 listened, but then he heard his own name mentioned. It was the
 woman who spoke.

<p>  For a long time nothing more was said. Baard perspired as he
 stood there, although it was a cold evening. The woman inside
 was busy over a pot that bubbled and hissed on the fire, an
 infant cried now and then, and Anders rocked the cradle.

<p>  &#147;Let us talk of something else,&#148; answered Anders.
 He rose soon after to go to the door. Baard had to hide himself
 in the woodshed, and Anders came to that very place to fetch
 an armful of wood. Baard stood in the corner and saw him distinctly;
 he had taken off his wretched church-clothes and had on the
 uniform in which he had come home from the war, just like Baard&#146;s.
 The brothers had promised each other never to wear these uniforms,
 but to leave them as heirlooms in the family. Anders&#146; was
 now patched and worn out, his strong, well-developed body appeared
 as if wrapped in a bundle of rags, and just then Baard could
 hear the gold watch ticking in his own pocket. Anders went to
 the place where the faggots lay; instead of immediately stooping
 to load himself, he stopped, leaned back against a pile of wood
 and looked out at the sky, which was clear and glittering with
 stars. Then he heaved a sigh and said:

<p>  &#147;Well&#151;well&#151;well&#151;my God, my God!&#148; As
 long as Baard lived he heard those words. He wanted to step
 forward and greet him, but just then Anders coughed and it sounded
 so harsh. That was enough to check him. Anders took his armful
 of wood and brushed by Baard so closely that the twigs scratched
 his face and made it smart.

<p>  He stood motionless on the same spot for quite ten minutes,
 and might have stood much longer had it not been that after
 so much strong emotion he was seized with a shivering fit that
 shook him from head to foot. Then he went out: he acknowledged
 frankly to himself that he was too cowardly to go in, so he
 now formed another plan. Out of a cinder-box which stood in
 the corner he had just left, he took some pieces of coal, found
 a splinter of resinous wood, went up into the barn, closed the
 door after him and struck a light. When he had got the wood
 lighted he looked for the peg upon which Anders hung his lantern
 when he came out in the early morning to thresh. Baard took
 off his gold watch and hung it on the peg, then extinguished
 his splinter and went away. He felt his heart so lightened that
 he ran over the snow like a young boy.

<p>  The next day he heard that the barn had been burned down in
 the night. Sparks had probably fallen from the splinter which
 he had lighted that he might see to hang up the watch.

<p>  This so overpowered him that all that day he sat like a sick
 person, took down his psalm-book and sang, so that the people
 in the house thought there must be something wrong with him.
 But in the evening he went out; it was bright moonlight. He
 went to his brother&#146;s farm, poked about on the site of
 the fire&#151;and found, sure enough, a little lump of gold.
 It was the watch, melted down.

<p>  A little girl had seen him scraping among the ashes on the
 site of the fire; some boys, on their way to a dance, had noticed
 him on the Sunday evening going down towards Anders&#146; farm;
 the people at home had told how strangely he had behaved on
 the Monday; and as everyone knew that he and his brother were
 bitter enemies, the matter was reported to the authorities and
 an inquiry set on foot. No one could prove anything against
 him, but suspicion clung to him. Reconciliation with his brother
 was now more impossible than ever.

<p>  Anders had thought of Baard when the barn was burnt, but had
 said so to no one. When, on the following evening, he saw him
 in his room, so white and strange-looking, he immediately thought:

<p>  Afterwards he heard how people had seen him go down to the
 buildings on the evening of the fire, and although nothing was
 brought to light by the inquiry, he was firmly convinced that
 Baard was the culprit. They met at the inquiry; Baard in his
 good clothes, Anders in his rags. As Anders entered, Baard looked
 over at him with such beseeching eyes that Anders felt the look
 in his very marrow.

<p>  But Anders took to drink from that day, and soon fell into
 a bad way. Baard suffered still more, although he did not drink.
 One would not have known him for the same man.

<p>  At last, late one evening, a poor woman came into the little
 room in which Baard lodged, and asked him to come out a little
 way with her. He knew it was his brother&#146;s wife. Baard
 at once understood upon what errand she had come; he turned
 as white as death, put on his things, and went with her without
 speaking a word. A faint glimmer of light came from Anders&#146;
 window, and they made for the gleam; for there was no path over
 the snow. When Baard stood once more in the passage he was met
 by a strange odour, which turned him sick. They went in. A little
 child was sitting on the hearth eating coal; its face was black
 all over, but it looked up, and laughed with white teeth. It
 was his brother&#146;s child. In the bed, with all kinds of
 clothes over him, lay Anders, wasted, with high, transparent
 forehead, looking with hollow eyes at his brother. Baard&#146;s
 knees trembled beneath him; he sat down on the foot of the bed
 and burst into a violent fit of weeping. The sick man looked
 at him immovably and was silent. At last he told his wife to
 go out, but Baard motioned her to stay,&#151;and now the two
 brothers began to talk together. They explained themselves from
 the day of their bidding for the watch right down to the moment
 of their present meeting. Baard concluded by taking out the
 lump of gold which he always carried about him, and each now
 confessed to the other that in all these years he had not felt
 happy for a single day. Anders did not say much for he was not
 able, but Baard sat at his bedside all through his illness.

<p>  What the brothers had said to each other as Baard sat by the
 bed made its way out through the walls and the night, and became
 known to every one in the village, and no one was more highly
 esteemed than Baard. Every one paid respect to him as they would
 to one who has had great sorrow and found joy again, or as to
 one who has been long absent. Baard was comforted by the friendliness
 which surrounded him, and devoted himself to the service of
 God. He wanted some occupation, he said, and so the old corporal
 took to teaching school. What he instilled into the children
 first and last was love; and he practised it himself, so that
 the little ones were devoted to him as a playfellow and father,
 all in one.

<p>  This, then, was the story of the old schoolmaster, and it took
 such a hold on Eyvind&#146;s mind that it became to him at once
 a religion and an education. The schoolmaster appeared to him
 almost a supernatural being, although he sat there so sociably
 and pretended to scold them. Not to know a lesson for him was
 impossible, and if he got a smile or a pat on the head after
 saying it he felt a glow of happiness for a whole day.

<p>  It always made the deepest impression on the children when
 the schoolmaster, before singing, would make a little speech;
 and at least once every week he used to read them a few verses
 about brotherly love. When he read the first of these verses
 there was always a quiver in his voice, although he had read
 it again and again for twenty or thirty years; it ran thus:

<p>  &#147;Come back again to-morrow as soon as it&#146;s light,
 or you&#146;ll catch it! Come back in good time little girls
 and boys, then we&#146;ll go to work with a will!&#148;
