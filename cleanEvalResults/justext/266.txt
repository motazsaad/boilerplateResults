<p>One by U2 is the most stunning and beautiful tunes. It has melancholy
 lyrics that are powerfully hopefull, mournfull, deeply personal,
 and touching. The music emotes and soars and lifts your heart
 up while breaking it.

<p>Bill

<p>Jed - East SussexThis is one of the greatest and most moving
 songs ever written. No matter how often you hear it, it never
 fails to affect you with its lyrics and deep emotion. A masterpiece.

<p>James hessleOne song, one album, one band. What a song, what
 a band, what an album. I am hope the repetion of my comment
 does not bore you. I thought it was a intresting way to put
 the point.

<p>Kuldip Sokhi, Enfield, Middlesex"One" has to be U2's best song.
 I have been a U2 fan since 1991. Achtung Baby was my first U2
 album. I have been hooked ever since. Every time you listen
 to this song, it sends shivers down your spine.

<p>Andrew Scully, EdinburghI love this one very much. It belongs
 up there with R.E.M's "Everybody Hurts" as being a beautiful
 yet tearjerking classic. And Johnny Cash's version was superb
 too.

<p>kgallagher manchesterone is a briiliant song and inspiring if
 you love u2 you will love this song

<p>NJH Lobo/ LondonWhat a beautiful song! So brilliant, calming
 and excellent.

<p>kelly wythenshawei think that one was an excellent song and still
 is its like a story of bono trying to say sorry for something
 a truly excellent track

<p>Sean in DublinIs there a vendetta against Johnny Cash? His version
 was better than either of these! Great lyric but Bono drowns
 it out with an overblown performance.

<p>Natalie - RochesterThis song is just amazing no words can do
 this one or U2 justice !

<p>Elijah May, KrakowDon't forget Johnny Cash's rendition of "One"....worth
 a listen.

<p>jimbo north walesBono is the all-time legend. With Or Without
 You is the no.1 track of all time.

<p>alan dickson fae fifebest u2 song man smell the flowers while
 u still can.

<p>Chris Cole/ Haywards HeathNot a die hard U2 fan but this is lyrically
 one of the best. Jonny Cash cover is spellbinding, heartbreaking
 almost especially 'did i ask to much, more than a lot, you gave
 me nothing now it's all I got.'

<p>Kevin MowattJohnny Cash did a version of this song that is on
 the American 3 album, I emplore you to listen to this version.
 Its as good as the original. 

<p>Martin - LichfieldJohnny Cash did the best cover version of this
 song. Without doubt. His cover makes you understand what it
 is really about.

<p>Vicky, Leigh"One" is a great U2 anthem with all the trademark
 inspirational lyrics and layers of sound you've come to expect
 from this band. U2 don't just tell a story, they create a soundscape
 which in this case is poignant but ultimately uplifting - a
 celebration of unity in diversity.

<p>Eliana Santiago, ChileI am actually listening this show from
 down here in Chile and is awesome how this song bring tears
 to your eyes the very moment it starts, WOW!

<p>Andrew R.Laing. GlagowMr Jonny Cash covered this epic song with
 his magical acoustic twist, long live the ONE

<p>Daniel Haverly LiverpoolWhilst I love U2, you have forgotten
 Johnny Cash's version which brought a raw bitter edge to the
 song. Fabulous
