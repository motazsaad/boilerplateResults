<p>"Purity is the opposite of integrity&#8212;the cruelest thing
 you can do to a person is make her ashamed of her own complexity.
 The stories of our lives have no morals. Any single conclusion
 drawn would be false; the episodes, taken together, are untranslatable,
 incomparable. If we are to conclude at all, we can only conclude
 against conclusions." -an excerpt fromFighting For Our Lives

<p> 

<p>this is the inaugural book in the 
 CrimethInc. Letters series
 . . .

<p>
 This is not the third 'CrimethInc. book,' rather, it is the
 first CrimethInc. Letters book. This is not direct propaganda,
 nor is it similar in most regards to previous CrimethInc. publications.
 This is a new voice, a new form, a new idea, but born of the
 same fires.

<p>These are our letters&#8212;to the universe. To each other. This
 is where we re-write our histories and create our own cultures
 without the mediation of corporations. When we are too far away
 from one another for campfire storytelling, we use our own voices
 here, and we use them to call out across the distance.

<p>
 Authors in the Letters series receive 10-20% (a sliding scale
 based on their financial situation) of the gross revenue for
 the book as payment: this is our effort to actually build sustainability
 into our pricing structure rather than nurture yet another generation
 of victimized, starving artists.
