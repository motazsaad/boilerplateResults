<p>All children 7 to 15 years old attend the nine year compulsory
 school. If parents so wish, the child may start from the age
 of six. Options after the comprehensive school are upper secondary
 school or vocational education. Upper secondary school: 2-year
 general school leading to the Matriculation Examination, giving
 successful students access to university and other higher education
 schools. The present vocational education system covers both
 general secondary and vocational programmes, with separate tracks
 for comprehensive school leavers and matriculated students.
 The system is being reformed.

<p>Higher education:

<p>Higher education in Ukraine is administered by the Ministry of
 Education  which coordinates the activities of higher schools
 and supervises the higher schools which are under other ministries.
 According to the "Law on Education", higher education includes
 the following levels and categories of establishment: level
 I -  vocational schools and other HEIs of a corresponding level;
 level II - colleges and other HEIs of a corresponding level
 which teach Bachelor and junior specialist courses; level III
 - institutes, conservatories,academies and universities that
 teach Bachelor's and Specialist, as well as junior specialist
 courses and ; level IV - institutes, conservatories, academies
 and universities which teach Bachelor's, Master's and Specialist
 courses. The degree system is under reform: The old system had
 only one stage of undergraduate studies, the degree of "Specialist",
 awarded after 5 years of study. The new system comprises two
 stages: undergraduate and graduate, with several degree levels.
 A Union of Rectors was created in 1993.

<p>Main laws/decrees governing higher education:

<p>Stages of studies:

<p>Post-secondary studies (technical/vocational type): 

<p>Non-university level:

<p>Since 1992 the whole system of Ukrainian postsecondary education
 is considered "higher education". According to the "Law on Education",
 the following levels and categories of establishments offer
 higher vocational education: level I - technical and vocational
 schools; level II - technicums and colleges. They award the
 qualification of Junior Specialist. Level III institutes are
 university-level institutions. Graduates from post-secondary
 vocational schools must sit for final examinations and defend
 a graduation thesis/work. The Diploma confers a right to employement
 at a pre-set level or the right to continue training in institutions
 of a higher level.

<p> 

<p>University level studies: 

<p>University level first stage: Bakalavr, Specialist:

<p>The academic and professional diploma of Bakalavr (BA, BEd.,
 BMed.) is generally awarded after four years of successful study
 (six years for Medicine). The Bakalavr programme comprises basic
 higher education and professional training in a given professional
 field. It is an intermediate degree. The degree (Diplom) of
 Specialist is awarded after five or six years of study, depending
 on the type of institution.

<p>University level second stage: Magister:

<p>The Magister (Master's Degree) is awarded on the basis of a Bachelor's
 Degree or Specialist's qualification generally one to two years
 after the first degree. Students must pass final examinations
 and defend a thesis.

<p>University level third stage: Doctoral Degree-1:

<p>Ukraine keeps a two-degree system at doctoral level: Kandydat
 nauk (Candidate of Sciences, comparable to the Ph.D.), and Doctor
 nauk. The first qualification is obtained after three or four
 years of study by submitting and publicly defending a thesis
 and passing the required examinations. The candidate's thesis
 can be prepared while following various forms of post-graduate
 studies.

<p>University level fourth stage: Doctoral Degree-2:

<p>The  "Doctor nauk" is the highest scientific degree in Ukraine,
 comparable to "Habilitation" in some Western countries. It is
 awarded to candidates already holding a "Kandidat nauk", on
 the successful presentation and defence of the "Doctor nauk"
 (habilitation) dissertation. The Habilitation dissertation should
 represent a major contribution to the development of a given
 field or branch of learning, and has to be published entirely
 or at least its main parts.

<p> 

<p>Teacher education: 

<p>Training of pre-primary and primary/basic school teachers

<p>Pre-primary and and primary school teachers are trained in teacher-training
 institutions of Levels I, II, and III of accreditation (vocational
 schools, technikums, and colleges). Practical training at kindergarten
 and primary schools are part of the teacher training programme.

<p>Training of secondary school teachers

<p>Training is provided by higher education institutions of Levels
 III and IV  of accreditation (institutes and universities),
 in different faculties (Education, Mathematics and Natural Sciences,
 Physical Education, etc.). The programme for teachers includes
 standard topics of education and psychology. Teachers of practical/vocational
 courses are trained in the technical education institutes.

<p>Training of higher education teachers

<p>There are no special forms of training for higher education teachers.
 Teachers of higher education are recruited among university
 graduates holding a Magister or Kandidat Nauk Degree who have
 followed special education courses through various types of
 assistance.

<p> 

<p>Non-traditional studies: 

<p>Distance higher education

<p>A network of correspondence and evening courses is intended for
 persons who are already employed. Candidates for such courses
 must not only pass an entrance examination, but also prove they
 effectively worked for a certain time.

<p>Lifelong higher education

<p>Some institutions of higher education (mostly private) have departments
 of continuing education providing teaching based on the principles
 of general higher education. Obtaining Diplomas depends on credits
 obtained in required topics, as well as on the presentation
 of a memoire.

<p>Higher education training in industry

<p>A certain number of higher education institutions organize evening
 classes in industry which are of the same level as full-time
 studies.

<p>Other forms of non-formal higher education

<p>The television of Ukraine broadcasts educational programmes of
 different levels for students and teachers in schools ranging
 from primary to upper secondary. These programmes are desiged
 to introduce teachers to new pedagogical methods.
