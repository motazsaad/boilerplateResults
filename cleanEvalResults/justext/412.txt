<h>Union

<p>How much is your time worth to you? A union is an organization
 of workers who push for the best possible working conditions
 - who else will? The boss? The boss invented sweatshops! Unions
 are easy to demonize, if you don't belong to one. They brought
 about the 40-hour work week, overtime pay, safety laws, and
 more, including previously-unknown prosperity for those who
 punched a clock. It enabled many to move to suburbia, buy homes,
 and raise kids who would grow up to demonize unions.

<p> In the field of computation theory, union is one of the regular
 operations. If A and B are languages (not necessarily regular
 languages) then the union of A and B (usually written A&cup;B)
 is defined as follows. 

<p>In SQL, UNION keyword does nothing more than mash the output
 of two or more queries together into one big resultset. UNION
 requres the queries to have the same number of columns. Second,
 the columns should have compatible data type and size, but some
 query engines are flexible on this strict ANSIrequirement. Third,
 the columns must have the same constraints with regard to null
 values. Either both columns must allow nulls or forbid nulls.
 Again, some products are less strict than the standard. Last,
 UNIONs may not be subqueries, nor may they have aggregate functions.
 Check your product's documentation for details.

<p>Here is what one looks like: 

<p> SELECT name, email, phone_number FROM salespeople UNION SELECT
 name, email, phone_number FROM engineers; 

<p>There are no column headings on purpose in the output example
 above. Since the column names are often different in the SELECT
 statements comprising the UNION, the query engine cannot know
 what to call the columns so quite often there are no column
 names in the output. Remember, the columns must be of the same
 type and size, but there is no requirement that their data be
 in any way related. You really can mix apples and oranges with
 a UNION query.

<p>One important "gotcha" with UNION is that by default it eliminates
 duplicate rows in each SELECT statement (see DISTINCT). To ensure
 each row gets returned, UNION ALL must be used.

<p> When A={a,b} is a pair (derived e.g. by the axiom of pairing),
 we use the more common notation a&cup;b = &cup;A. This notation
 is also used when a=b. 

<p> Note, however, that the existence of unions &cup;A when A is
 infinite does not follow from the existence of unions of such
 pairs. In particular: The cardinality of a finite union is bounded
 by the cardinalities of A and of each of the elements of A.
 But the cardinality of an infinite (even countable) union has
 no such bound. Hence the need for an axiom. 

<p> When A is an indexed set A = {ai: i&isin;I} for some index set
 I, notations based on &cup;i&isin;Iai = &cup;A are common. Thus,
 we may see 

<h>Defined behaviour

<l>A pointer to the union can be converted into a pointer to the
 type of any of the fields (in particular, it has the correct
 alignment for each of these types); 

<l>Reading any but the last-written field of the union yields undefined
 behaviour; 

<l>The sizeof the union is the largest of the sizeofs each of the
 members. 

<p> As usual, standardese prohibits the use of words such as "memory",
 or indeed any mention of implementation. But we all know what
 they mean. 

<p> Since no portableconversions exist in such a configuration,
 standard C unions are limited to expressing just the "variant"
 part of Pascal's variant records. C has no notion of the type
 member; if YOU want to know the type currently stored in a union,
 YOU have to make sure you know what it is. One way to do this
 could be to say 

<h>Undefined Behaviour

<p> Once compiler-specificfeatures are taken into account, unions
 naturally become more flexible: you can taken advantage of specific
 knowledge of what the "undefined behaviour" of reading from
 a "wrong" member will do. For instance, the standard assigns
 no meaning to this code: 

<p> It invokes undefined behaviour. However, a particular implementation
 MAY specify that such code will work "correctly". This would
 involve ensuring that longs and void pointers have appropriate
 sizes, and that the "correct" conversion does indeed occur.
 

<p> For such purposes too, unions are a very practicable way for
 implementation-specific code to achieve certain behaviours.
 

<p> There isn't really one, except that the Englishlanguage provides
 the same word for both. The C union { A a; B b; }; can store
 all values of the disjoint union A&cup;B. But it relies on labeled
 values (you can store in either of the fields .a and .b, and
 you must specify which one you mean). And if A and B refer to
 the same type, the distinction is even more pronounced. 

<p> C unions better fit (one of) the semantics commonly ascribed
 to "A ``square cup'' B", which isn't really a union in the mathematical
 sense. 

<p>Un"ion &#91;F., from L. unio oneness, union, a single large pearl,
 a kind of onion, fr. unus one. See One, and cf. Onion, Unit.&#93;
 

<p>1.

<p>The act of uniting or joining two or more things into one, or
 the state of being united or joined; junction; coalition; combination.

<p>Union differs from connection, as it implies that the bodies
 are in contact, without an interening body; whereas things may
 be connected by the invention of a third body, as by a cord
 or chain. 

<p>2.

<p>Agreement and conjunction of mind, spirit, will, affections,
 or the like; harmony; concord.

<p>3.

<p>That which is united, or made one; something formed by a combination
 or coalition of parts or members; a confederation; a consolidated
 body; a league; as, the weavers have formed a union; trades
 unions have become very numerous; the United States of America
 are often called the Union.

<p>A. Hamilton.

<p>4.

<p>A textile fabric composed of two or more materials, as cotton,
 silk, wool, etc., woven together.

<p>5.

<p>A large, fine pearl.

<p> &#91;Obs.&#93; 

<p>If they &#91;pearls&#93; be white, great, round, smooth, and
 weighty . . . our dainties and delicates here at Rome . . .
 call them unions, as a man would say "singular," and by themselves
 alone. Holland.

<p>In the cup an union shall he throw, Richer than that which four
 successive kings In Denmark's crown have worn. Shak.

<p>6.

<p>A device emblematic of union, used on a national flag or ensign,
 sometimes, as in the military standard of Great Britain, covering
 the whole field; sometimes, as in the flag of the United States,
 and the English naval and marine flag, occupying the upper inner
 corner, the rest of the flag being called the fly. Also, a flag
 having such a device; especially, the flag of Great Britain.

<p>&rArr; The union of the United States ensign is a cluster of
 white stars, denoting the union of the States, and, properly,
 equal in number to that of the States, displayed on a blue field;
 the fly being composed of alternate stripes of red and white.
 The union of the British ensign is the three crosses of St.
 George, St. Andrew, and St. Patrick in combination, denoting
 the union of England, Scotland and Ireland, displayed on a blue
 field in the national banner used on shore, on a red, white,
 or blue field in naval ensigns, and with a white border or fly
 in the merchant service. 

<p>7. Mach. 

<p>A joint or other connection uniting parts of machinery, or the
 like, as the elastic pipe of a tender connecting it with the
 feed pipe of a locomotive engine; especially, a pipe fitting
 for connecting pipes, or pipes and fittings, in such a way as
 to facilitate disconnection.

<p>8. Brewing 

<p>A cask suspended on trunnions, in which fermentation is carried
 on.

<p>Syn. -- Unity; junction; connection; concord; alliance; coalition;
 combination; confederacy. -- Union, Unity. Union is the act
 of bringing two or more things together so as to make but one,
 or the state of being united into one. Unity is a state of simple
 oneness, either of essence, as the unity of God, or of action,
 feeling, etc., as unity of design, of affection, etc. Thus,
 we may speak of effecting a union of interests which shall result
 in a unity of labor and interest in securing a given object.

 In unity defective; which requires Collateral love, and dearest
 amity. Milton.
