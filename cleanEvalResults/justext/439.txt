Earlier this year, CBS aired a now-infamous 60 Minutes episode
 in which Rather presented typed memoranda supposedly written
 over 30 years ago by President George W. Bush&#146;s Texas Air
 National Guard commander, the late Lieutenant Colonel Jerry
 B. Killian. The documents purported to show that Bush received
 preferential treatment while serving in the military. Hours
 after the broadcast, well-known bloggers like Little Green Footballs,
 Power Line, and the widely known Instapundit &#151; as well
 as NRO's Kerry Spot &amp; The Corner &#151; were casting doubt
 on the documents&#146; authenticity. As the controversy grew,
 they posted frequent updates and became virtual clearinghouses
 of information. 

<p>The rest is well-documented history, so to speak. 

<p>The thing about history, though, is that the efforts of minor
 players often go unnoticed. During the scandal, high-trafficked
 bloggers were interviewed on radio and television and mentioned
 in countless news articles. Two appeared on the cover of Time
 magazine. But smaller, lesser-known, and lower-trafficked blogs
 that didn&#146;t get press coverage served a valuable function
 during Rathergate. By linking to well-known blogs, articles,
 documents, and one another, they made worthy contributions.
 A few even conducted their own independent, journalistic-style
 investigations (often scooping the professionals). 

<p>&#147;It all happened organically, without any controlling influence
 at all, and it happened fast,&#148; says Jeff Harrell about
 the growth of the blogosphere-fueled controversy. A freelance
 writer from Texas, Harrell&#146;s blog, The Shape of Days, was
 frequently linked to by Instapundit as the story picked up steam.
 

<p>Once the story caught on, it spread rapidly across the web, though
 some bloggers were skeptical at first. &#147;It just seemed
 the type of thing that could make the blogosphere look bad if
 people jumped the gun and start[ed] crying &#145;forgery&#146;
 without actual evidence,&#148; admits a blogger who goes by
 the name &#147;Cassandra&#148; and runs I Love Jet Noise.

<p>Rusty Shackleford, a political-science professor who hosts MyPetJawa,
 says he followed the story very closely but urged bloggers to
 proceed carefully. &#147;My original post was quoted all over
 the blogosphere as a word of caution to those boring full speed
 ahead on indicting the Killian memo.&#148; 

<p>He eventually joined the blogosphere&#146;s quest for the truth
 as he searched the National Archives to find out whether the
 U.S. Air Force had purchased a typewriter during the stated
 time frame capable of producing the memos.

<p>Other bloggers saw the frenzy as political noise. &#147;I despise
 partisan bickering,&#148; insists Harrell. &#147;I thought this
 story was just another example&#133;I dismissed it pretty early
 on.&#148;

<p>Once the CBS memos seemed likely to be forgeries, some bloggers
 began investigating different aspects of the story. &#147;Patterico,&#148;
 a prosecutor in California, fact-checked ABC News and posted
 the results on his site, Patterico&#146;s Pontifications. He
 said ABC News falsely concluded that posters on FreeRepublic.com
 &#151; the conservative news forum where the hoax idea germinated
 &#151; were the forgers of the documents. 

<p>Patterico contends that ABC News&#146;s conclusion was based
 on a misreading of the time-zone stamp on the posts, which they
 had assumed to be Eastern time. &#147;ABCNEWS failed to note
 that the time stamp was Pacific time. Based on this simple mistake&#133;[the
 network] falsely concluded that internet (sic) posters had posted
 their doubts about the documents before the program had ended,&#148;
 he wrote. ABC News has since corrected the error on its website.

<p>Additionally, Patterico interviewed &#147;Buckhead&#148; and
 &#147;TankerC,&#148; the subjects of ABC&#146;s report and the
 first to express doubt about the memos. &#147;I knew that these
 individuals would likely be the focus of some interest from
 the media, and that loonies would try to connect them to Karl
 Rove. I thought it would be interesting for them to get their
 real stories before the public.&#148;

<p>Now that&#146;s journalism. 

<p>Like Patterico, Harrell used the power of the web to gather information
 and answer questions. &#147;[W]hile the typographic evidence
 of forgery was pretty good, there was one hole I wanted to fill.&#148;
 It seemed that the IBM Selectric Composer, an expensive typewriter
 from the 1970s, might have been able to produce the memos. While
 that possibility had been dismissed, Harrell continued to investigate.
 The expert he tracked down, a Composer owner, confirmed it could
 not have produced the documents. &#147;I wanted to rule it out
 conclusively,&#148; Harrell said. 

<p>While other bloggers parsed news reports and interviewed experts,
 Bill Dyer used his own expertise to add insight. A practicing
 lawyer in Texas who runs the BeldarBlog, Dyer verified and posted
 the professional credentials of lawyer bloggers pursuing Rathergate
 &#151; such as Glenn Reynolds (Instapundit) and Hugh Hewitt
 &#151; after Jonathan Klein, former executive vice president
 of CBS News, referred to bloggers as &#147;a guy sitting in
 his living room in his pajamas writing.&#148; 

<p>The effect bloggers have had on traditional journalism as they
 become fact-checkers, disseminators of information, and &#147;citizen
 journalists&#148; is still in flux. But the paradigm has clearly
 shifted in determining what is news and who is qualified to
 cover it, and smaller bloggers are playing an important role.
 Tom Maguire, host of the blog Just One Minute, also frequently
 linked to by Instapundit, says that smaller bloggers can do
 research to uncover overlooked angles and connections.

<p>Patterico believes smaller bloggers can be noticed. Although
 larger ones get the media coverage, smaller bloggers can still
 break stories. &#147;[I]f your message is unique, there is still
 a good chance it will get attention.&#148;

<p>Others see the importance of blogs and public interaction, particularly
 during Rathergate. &#147;[B]y making the news cycle interactive,
 bloggers had essentially resurrected the front-porch aspect
 of civil life where folks used to gather to discuss the issues
 of the day,&#148; Cassandra says. Blogging is &#147;revitalizing
 democracy.&#148;

<p>At least one journalist seems to agree. Chris Satullo, editorial-page
 editor at the Philadelphia Inquirer, recognizes the role of
 bloggers but stressed that journalists are still necessary.
 &#147;The idea is not that journalists know what the best result
 is; it&#146;s that democracy works best when issues get aired,
 real dialogue happens and ordinary people aren&#146;t shut out
 of the deal by elites. [A]ny card-carrying civic journalist
 is going to celebrate the blogosphere.&#148;

<p>
The media continues to miss part of the story. Please look at
 the posting below, which shows that TankerKC posted suspicions
 RIGHT DURING THE BROADCAST!! Note the time was 8:19pm EDT, not
 Pacific Time. TankerKC saw the memo and knew right away it look
 like BS. Buckhead then did the research and made the case. 

<p>
The fraud was so obvious that Freepers were on it while the
 broadcast was still running. CBS HAD to know within 48 Hours
 at the most that the memo was bogus, yet they continued to defend
 it. THAT is the real story!

WE NEED TO SEE THOSE MEMOS AGAIN! 
They are not
 in the style that we used when I came in to the USAF. They looked
 like the style and format we started using about 12 years ago
 (1992). Our signature blocks were left justified, now they are
 rigth of center...like the ones they just showed. 

<p>
Can we get a copy of those memos?

<p>Actually, the language quoted in the article is from a post of
 mine, and it's a little sloppy. I was refuting the theory that
 Buckhead expressed his detailed conclusions about the documents
 during the program. His opinions came a couple of hours after
 the program, as my post details. (My post also has the first
 public comments by Buckhead other than on FreeRepublic.com.)

<p>
 But I was fully aware that TankerKC (not "TankerC" as the article
 mistakenly calls him) had expressed generalized doubts about
 the documents during the program. I made that point clear in
 another post, in which I interviewed TankerKC. That post has
 a more detailed description of the evolution of the controversy
 here on FreeRepublic.com.

<p>
 In any event, thanks for posting the article, and once again,
 my hat is off to the Freepers who first raised doubts about
 the documents. It was a landmark event in the history of interactions
 between the internet and Big Media -- and it no doubt brought
 down Dan Rather's career early.

<p>The "secondary blogs" just picked up the scoops they found here
 on the FReep, and passed them along as their own.

<p>
 You probably didn't mean any offense, but I resent that if
 it's directed towards me. I sure did pick up scoops from this
 forum, but didn't pass them off as my own. The NPR/Media Matters
 post came from several sources: a reader of mine heard the NPR
 story, I found the Media Matters story, and I told Buckhead
 about both. He told me why they had gotten the timing wrong,
 but was reticent about being quoted. When I first did the post,
 he had not given me permission to quote him; in the update,
 he did.

<p>
 I always attribute things I get from other places, unless I
 have an agreement with the source not to disclose their identity.
 In all my posts where I picked things up from Freepers, I sourced
 them unless they had asked me not to.

<p>I don't mean to sound harsh, but you have to understand that
 accusing people of ripping off others' observations is considered
 an attack on our integrity. My integrity is everything and I
 can't have people getting the wrong impression.

<p>Thanks for posting this Jim. It was not just Blather who ended
 up as a big loser this past year. Thanks to Free Republic and
 conservative blogs, ABCNNBCBS took a potentially lethal blow
 this year. 

<p>Now we are doing the same thing with the liars/spinners suffering
 from Rummy Phobia. 

<p>Merry Christmas Jim.

<p> Well, finally someone has it right, Conservative News Forum.
 Not a blog!

<p>Travis - Patterico's been busting the LA Times's chops frequently
 (and most entertainly) for quite some time and  his site just
 won the  2004 Weblog Award for sites ranked 100 to 250 in the
 TTLB Ecosysystem. Check it out. (Please note: I am not affiliated
 in any way with Patterico, other than as a frequent reader.)

<p>Also unmentioned was the microbiologist FReeper who used a computer-graphic
 program normally used to spot culture growth in Petri-dishes
 to overlay the fake memo with one produced in Word. 

<p>They were identical, and he posted the graphic results here on
 FR. 

<p>I sure wish I could remember his screen name...

<p>Suit yourself. For my money, FR is not the be-all and end-all,
 just a wonderful gathering place for folks to discuss the news
 of the day. I enjoy FR along with a few other sites, such as
 Instapundit, Hugh Hewitt, NRO, Powerline, Patterico, Tech Central,
 Tim Blair, and of course Scrappleface (because "laughter is
 the bext medicine"). YMMV.
