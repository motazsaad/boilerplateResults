 IDSA Book Club - John Heskett's Toothpicks and Logos
 March
 18 @ 6:30 PM
 led by Paul Hatch of TEAMS Design

 1812 West Hubbard St, # 3A
 Chicago, IL 60622www.teamsdesign.com

<p>Originally planned for December 2002, this book club review has
 been rescheduled once again for March 18th. It turns out the
 only two times we&#146;ve gotten any real snow this winter have
 been the days book club was scheduled. We&#146;ll, we&#146;ve
 decided to give this book one more chance. So, please come out
 and join us for some lively chat at TEAMS new location.

<p>Note: Book Club is looking for their next book to review. If
 you have a book you&#146;ve recently enjoyed, please bring it
 along for discussion. All are welcome.

<p>After the previous books were wide-ranging in scope, it's time
 now for us to take an introspective look at our own profession
 with John Heskett's new book Toothpicks and Logos. The author
 of the 1981 book "Industrial Design" (an essential item on every
 self-respecting industrial designer's bookshelf) he now succeeds
 to define industrial design by reflecting it against modern
 contexts such as cultural, technological, environmental and
 corporate influences.

<p>"Design is one of the basic characteristics of what it is to
 be human, and an essential determinant of the quality of human
 life." - a principle that nurtures his book as much as our profession.

<p>The workshop will focus on integration of sketch models into
 the design process, and will provide an intro to the associated
 materials and techniques.

<p>Chicago Fight Club
June 26 at Teams Design
 1812 West Hubbard
 St.
 7 pm

<p>Building on the success of the Book Club, the Chicago chapter
 is setting up a new social event for Chicago Designers. Paul
 Hatch: "We found that the chief attraction of the Book Club
 is the social aspect of the meeting, which typically only briefly
 focuses on the chosen book. Discourse then ran the full gambit
 of topics."

<p>Fight Club is a more targeted discussion, around a chosen topic
 of debate such as a film, TV show or current exhibition. The
 first meeting will be centered on the film Matrix Reloaded.
 Here, two volunteers will take extreme pro and contra angles
 to debate the merits and pitfalls of the film, the actors, and
 the genre. Everyone else can add their spice to the debate on
 either side. 

<p>First Rule of Fight Club: There are no debating rules.
 Second
 Rule of Fight Club: There can only be one winner.

<p>Being able to articulate and defend your opinion is one of the
 most
 important skills a designer could have, and one that is
 rarely taught in school. Join us on June 26 for the very first
 IDSA verbal slugfest.

<p>Come see how local designers use their 3D software. Which one
 is the best? Is there a perfect software just for us? We will
 explore these questions while Kent Solberg of Sram, Bart Brechja
 of Design-Engine.com, Aaron Eiger of Design Integrity, and Chris
 Houghton of Insight model up something cool for us! We will
 look at Rhino, Pro E, Alias, and Solid Works.

<p>  IDSA Chicago&#8217;s Second FIGHT CLUB, November 20.
  
 After
 the success of the first Fight Club we knew there had to be
 a follow up debate, so here it is: Sex and Violence.
  
 Most
 of Europe and Canada have less than 100 mortalities per year
 through violence, whereas the US averages around 11,000 through
 guns alone. The US has also cornered the market in its pornography
 business and yet has one of the tightest restrictions on nudity
 on TV. Is it not also contradictory to blur out partial nudity
 while we can watch decapitations in full gory detail on primetime
 TV?
  
 This no-holds barred &#8216;street debate&#8217; will
 cover these topics and also discuss the effects sex &amp; violence
 has on TV viewers, what censorship does, etc. 

<p> What is Fight Club? Picture this:
 &#8211; Two fighters under
 a spotlight, circled by 50 onlookers.
 &#8211; One subject matter,
 two radically opposing opinions.
 &#8211; Darkened empty loft
 space, multimedia backdrop.
 &#8211; Angry questions, careful
 answers, and heartfelt arguments.
 &#8211; One winner.
  
 Two
 volunteers -the fighters- take extreme for and against stances
 to debate the merits and pitfalls of the subject. Everyone else
 adds their spice to the debate on either side.

<p>First Rule of Fight Club: There are no debating rules.
 Second
 Rule of Fight Club: There can only be one winner.

<p>French Vietnamese food that is highly recommended on Metromix,
 the NY Times etc.
