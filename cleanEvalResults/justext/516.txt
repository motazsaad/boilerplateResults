 above London with Buckingham Palace immediately below, Westminster
 Abbey, the Houses of Parliament, the River Thames and the London

<p>Concorde - The Final Touchdown by Ivan Berryman.

<p> Shortly after 2.00pm on Friday 24th October 2003, supersonic
 commercial aviation was brought to a close as three British
 Airways Concordes touched down within minutes of each other
 at Londons Heathrow Airport for the last time. Here, BA Captain
 Mike Bannister bring G-BOAG  home for the final touchdown. 

<p> Concorde sweeps majestically over central London as this wonderful
 aircraft comes to the end of its career in October 2003. Buckingham
 Palace is immediately beneath the aircraft, with the River Thames,
 Houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey and the London Eye in
 the middle distance.  

<p> A sad, but magnificent sight on 24th October 2003 as the last
 three British Airways Concordes bring commercial supersonic
 travel to a close, as they taxi together to their final dispersal
 at Heathrow.
