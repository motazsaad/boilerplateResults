<h>Q: What is the Fair Housing Act? 

<h>A: The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing on
 the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, familial
 status, or disability by housing providers. It applies to landlords
 and real estate companies as well as other entities, such as
 municipalities, banks or other lending institutions, and homeowners
 insurance companies. 

<h>Q: How does the Department of Justice enforce the Fair Housing
 Act? 

<h>A: Under the Fair Housing Act, the Department of Justice may
 start a lawsuit where it has reason to believe that a person
 or entity is engaged in a "pattern or practice" of discrimination,
 or where a denial of rights to a group of persons raises an
 issue of general public importance. Through these lawsuits,
 the Department can obtain money damages, both actual and punitive
 damages, for those individuals harmed by a defendant's discriminatory
 actions, as well as prevent any further discriminatory conduct.
 The violator may also be required to pay money penalties to
 the United States. 

<l>The Department of Housing and Urban Development [“HUD”] investigates
 individual cases of discrimination in housing. If HUD determines
 that reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory
 housing practice has occurred, then either the person complaining
 or the person against whom the complaint was filed may elect
 to have the case heard in federal court. In those instances,
 the Department of Justice will bring the case on behalf of the
 individual complainant. In addition, where force or a threat
 of force is used to deny or interfere with fair housing rights,
 the Department of Justice may begin criminal proceedings. 

<l>Finally, in cases involving discrimination in home mortgage loans
 or home improvement loans, the Department may file suit under
 both the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.
 

<h>Q: What do I do if I believe I’ve been the victim of illegal
 discrimination in housing? 

<h>A: Individuals who believe that they have been victims of an
 illegal housing practice may file a complaint with the Department
 of Housing and Urban Development [“HUD”] or file their own lawsuit
 in federal or state court. 

<l>You must file the complaint with HUD within one year of the incident
 you believe to be housing discrimination. 

<l>If you choose to file your own lawsuit in federal or state court,
 the Act requires that you do so within two years of the incident.
 

<h>Q: Does the Fair Housing Act prohibit discrimination on the basis
 of a person's sexual orientation? 

<h>A: When sexual orientation is the only basis of discrimination,
 no. However, these complaints are evaluated on a case-by-case
 basis to determine whether any other form of discrimination
 is present (such as sex or disability, for example). 

<l>Many state and local laws prohibit discrimination in housing
 based on sexual orientation. You should consult with your local
 or state civil rights enforcement agency to determine whether
 discrimination on this basis is protected. 

<h>Q: What is the Equal Credit Opportunity Act? 

<h>A: Under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, a creditor may not
 discriminate on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national
 origin, marital status, age or source of income in any credit
 transaction. 

<h>Q: How does the Department of Justice enforce the Equal Credit
 Opportunity Act? 

<h>A: The Department of Justice may start a lawsuit when it has
 reason to believe that a creditor is engaged in a "pattern or
 practice" of discrimination. Through these lawsuits, the Department
 can obtain money damages, both actual and punitive damages,
 for those individuals harmed by discriminatory actions, as well
 as prevent further discrimination by the defendant. 

<l>Individual complaints of discrimination are handled by the creditor's
 federal regulatory agency. The agencies and the types of financial
 institutions that they regulate are as follows: 

<l>Office of Thrift Supervision [“OTS:]: 

<l>Savings associations and federally chartered savings banks (the
 word "Federal" or the initials "F.S.B." appear in federal institution's
 name). 

<l>Comptroller of Currency [“OCC”]: 

<l>National banks, federal branches/agencies of foreign banks (the
 word "National" or the initials "N.A." appear in or after the
 bank's name). 

<l>Federal Reserve Board [“FRB”]: 

<l>Financial institutions that are members of the Federal Reserve
 System, except national banks and federal branches/agencies
 of foreign banks. 

<l>Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation [“FDIC”]: 

<l>State chartered banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve
 System. 

<l>National Credit Union Association [“NCUA”]: 

<l>Federal credit unions (the words "Federal credit union" appear
 in the institution's name). 

<l>Federal Trade Commission {“FTC”]: 

<l>Retailers, finance companies, creditors (including most mortgage
 companies) that aren’t assigned to another agency 

<h>Q: What do I do if I believe that I’ve been the victim of an
 unfair credit transaction involving residential property? 

<h>A: Individuals who believe that they have been victims of an
 illegal housing practice - such as the denial of a mortgage-
 involving credit may file a complaint with the Department of
 Housing and Urban Development [“HUD”]. 

<h>Q: What is Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964? 

<h>A: This law prohibits discrimination because of a person's race,
 color, religion, or national origin in certain places of public
 accommodation, such as hotels, restaurants and places of entertainment.
 

<h>Q: How does the Department of Justice enforce Title II? 

<h>A: When there is reason to believe that a person or entity has
 engaged in a "pattern or practice" of discrimination which violates
 Title II, the Department of Justice can bring a lawsuit. However,
 unlike lawsuits enforcing the Fair Housing Act or the Equal
 Credit Opportunity Act, the Department cannot obtain monetary
 damages for individuals in Title II cases. 

<h>Q: What do I do if I believe that I’ve been the victim of discrimination
 under Title II? 

<h>A: Individuals who believe that a place of public accommodation
 has violated Title II may file their own lawsuit in federal
 court. In addition, you may some rights under other federal
 laws, state laws, or local ordinances and should consult with
 your local or state civil rights enforcement agency.
