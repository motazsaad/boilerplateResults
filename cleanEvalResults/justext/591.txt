The lands of Balfour, or Bal-orr, lie in the parish of Markinch
 in Fife. The Orr is a tributary of the River Leven. According
 to tradition, the lands were given to Siward, a Northumbrian,
 during the reign of Duncan I. The earliest dependable record
 of the name is a charter of William the Lion in favour of Michael
 de Balfour around 1196. Sir Duncan de Balfour supported the
 cause of Sir William Wallace and was killed at the Battle of
 Blackironside in 1298, although the engagement was a great victory
 for the Scots. Sir John Balfour of Balfour died in 1375 and
 his estates passed to his only daughter, Margaret, wife of Sir
 Robert de Bethune. The Bethunes of Balfour were to flourish
 and figure prominently in Scottish history through such personalities
 as Cardinal Bethune and Mary Beaton, celebrated as one of the
 &#145;four Maries&#146;, the ladies-in-waiting of Mary, Queen
 of Scots. The Balfours continued through the descendants of
 Adam, the brother of Sir John Balfour, who married into the
 powerful Macduff Earls of Fife. Adam died of wounds sustained
 at the Battle of Durham in 1346 and his son was brought up in
 the household of the earl. He prospered greatly by his family
 connections and from him descend the Balfours of Denmylne, Forret,
 Torry and Kinloch. James Balfour of Denmylne was killed at the
 siege of Roxburgh in 1460 and his son John died, along with
 the greater part of the Scottish nobility, at the Battle of
 Flodden in 1513. Sir Michael Balfour was Comptroller of the
 Household to Charles I and fought for the king&#146;s cause
 during the civil war. Sir James Balfour, son of Sir Michael
 Balfour of Denmylne, was created Lord Lyon, King of Arms, in
 June 1630. He was a distinguished heraldic scholar and antiquary
 who wrote a number of important treatises on heraldry. He was
 also a chronicler of the Scottish monarchy, and his Annals and
 Short Passages of State was published in book form almost two
 centuries later, in 1824. Sir Andrew Balfour, Baronet, also
 of the house of Denmylne, was a distinguished botanist and founder
 of the Botanic Garden of Edinburgh (which now flourishes as
 the Royal Scottish Botanical Garden). He was also a noted physician
 and the first president of the Royal College of Physicians in
 Scotland. He died in 1694.

 Sir James Balfour of Forret was knighted in 1674 and elevated
 to the Supreme Court in Edinburgh taking the judicial title,
 &#145;Lord Forret&#146;. He was subsequently appointed judge
 of the High Court of Justiciary. Another branch of the family,
 the Balfours of Burleigh, were raised to the peerage with the
 title of &#145;Lord Balfour of Burleigh&#146;, in 1606. The
 fifth Lord Balfour of Burleigh brought the family&#146;s fortunes
 to a very low ebb at the start of the eighteenth century. He
 formed a strong romantic attachment to a girl considered to
 be of &#145;unsuitable&#146; family, and his father sent him
 abroad, hoping that time and distance would cool his ardour.
 The infatuated Master of Burleigh swore his undying love to
 the girl and promised that if she married anyone else in his
 absence he would kill him. Time passed and the girl put aside
 Balfour&#146;s threat and married Henry Stenhouse, a local schoolmaster.
 On his eventual return the Master of Burleigh made immediate
 enquiry after his love, and on learning the truth, sought out
 the schoolmaster and shot him in the shoulder. Stenhouse died
 of his wounds some days later. Balfour was tried before the
 High Court in August 1709 and despite a most ingenious defence
 he was sentenced to death. He escaped from prison by changing
 clothes with his sister, and he went into hiding. He succeeded
 to the title on the death of his father in 1713. He joined the
 cause of the &#145;Old Pretender&#146; in the rebellion of 1715,
 for which he was declared a traitor. His title and estates were
 forfeited by an Act of Attainder in November 1715. He died unmarried
 in 1757. The attainder was reversed in 1869 in favour of Mary,
 the heir of Lord Balfour&#146;s sister, who had bravely taken
 his place in the condemned cell. Alexander, sixth Lord Balfour
 of Burleigh, was a Knight of the Thistle and Secretary of State
 for Scotland from 1895 to 1903. Arthur James Balfour, who was
 descended from the Balfours of Balbirnie, was Prime Minister
 from 1902 to 1905, and was created Earl of Balfour in May 1922.
 In 1843, William Balfour of Trenabie in Orkney proved his descent
 from the principal family, and received a grant of supporters
 from the Lord Lyon, King of Arms, as representer and head of
 the house. The arms were rematriculated in 1936.
