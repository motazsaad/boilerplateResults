<p>Ed Lu was NASA&#8217;s science officer on the Expedition 7 mission
 to the International Space Station from April until October
 2003. He and cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko were the first two-person
 crew to live board the Station following the loss of the Space
 Shuttle Columbia in February 2003. The crew flew to and returned
 from the Station aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket.

<p>On riding the Soyuz spacecraft:
 &#8220;I had the pleasure to
 fly twice on the Shuttle, and I can tell you the experience
 in Russia is very different,&#8221; Lu said. &#8220;When you&#8217;re
 launching on the Shuttle, it shakes a lot. It&#8217;s like driving
 over a dirt road at 40 to 50 miles per hour.&#8221; The vibrations
 are caused by the Shuttle&#8217;s Solid Rocket Boosters. Since
 the Soyuz rocket relies entirely on liquid-fuel engines, it&#8217;s
 a much smoother ride. However, the Soyuz is a three-stage rocket,
 and there&#8217;s a strong acceleration when the stages separate,
 particularly the last one. &#8220;When that thing went, if felt
 like we&#8217;d been kicked in the butt by a giant.&#8221; Another
 difference was that he and Malenchenko were not allowed to carry
 as much with them on the Soyuz for their 6-month stay. Landing
 was also very different. For example, the Soyuz uses an ablative
 heat shield, which means it burns up as the craft re-enters
 the atmosphere. &#8220;I remember looking out the window watching
 pieces of our ship burn off, which is normal, but it&#8217;s
 still a little bit disconcerting,&#8221; he said. The Soyuz
 also uses a parachute attached to the side of the spacecraft.
 When it opens, the crew is hanging sidewise, spinning in a circle.

<p>On the International Space Station:
 &#8220;The Space Station
 is like a big tube now,&#8221; Lu said. &#8220;It&#8217;s about
 the size of a large jetliner.&#8221; As the Soyuz approached
 the Station, he said it &#8220;looked like a small model. It
 really feels like you&#8217;re in a science fiction movie.&#8221;
 With the smaller crew and fewer supplies coming up from Earth,
 keeping equipment operational was an important part of the crew&#8217;s
 duties. &#8220;We spent a lot of time working on equipment,&#8221;
 he said. &#8220;Another thing we spent a lot of time doing was
 exercise.&#8221; The exercise paid off&#8212;Lu was one of the
 first American astronauts to return from a long-duraction spaceflight
 with almost no loss in bone density and little loss in muscle
 strength. The crew was given an &#8220;exercise prescription&#8221;
 for the work-out they had to perform. &#8220;And, I did extra
 on top of that on my own,&#8221; Lu said. &#8220;I came back
 with less bone loss than anyone.&#8221; His experience will
 help astronauts healthy when they begin making the long trips
 to other worlds. &#8220;When we do fly to Mars or asteroids
 or far away locations, it will take months,&#8221; he said.
 &#8220;It could even take years.&#8221; Lu said he enjoyed his
 stay on the Station. &#8220;It was a blast from start to finish.
 Towards the ending I was wishing it would last a little longer.
 I wasn&#8217;t ready to come home yet.&#8221;

<p>On eating aboard the Space Station:
 &#8220;The food up there
 is pretty good, actually,&#8221; Lu said. However, while the
 food is tasty, it gets monotonous after a while, much like eating
 at your favorite restaurant every night would be. &#8220;For
 us, it&#8217;s 3 months before we get to eat somewhere else.&#8221;
 That&#8217;s why the crew looks forward to the arrival of the
 Progress cargo ship, carrying supplies from Earth. &#8220;It
 is a welcome thing, because it brings fresh food.&#8221; Another
 welcome delivery of the Progress is odors. &#8220;Space Station
 has no smell whatsoever,&#8221; Lu said, explaining that, because
 of the air circulation system, when you open a can of food,
 you can smell it only for seconds before the odor is circulated
 away. When the Progress docked, however, the astronauts could
 smell food inside. &#8220;When you opened the valve up, before
 you actually open the hatch, you could smell apples in the Space
 Station,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We were looking at our watches
 (until it was time to open the hatch). Those things tasted terrific.&#8221;

<p>On playing the piano upside down in microgravity:
 You can&#8217;t
 do it. When you&#8217;re upside down, &#8220;everything&#8217;s
 reversed,&#8221; Lu explained. &#8220;If you ever try it, it&#8217;s
 not as easy as it looks.&#8221;

<p>On the view from the Space Station:
 &#8220;With binoculars,
 you can see airplanes in flight,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You
 can see individual buildings. I even have a picture of my home.
 You can also see lots of craters on the surface of the Earth.&#8221;
 Lu showed us a picture he took from the Space Station which
 showed the Moon and Mars next to each other in a single frame.
 &#8220;This is one of my favorite pictures from the mission,
 because it shows where we&#8217;re going.&#8221; Mars, which
 was closer to Earth than it had been in 60,000 years when Lu
 was on the Station, put on quite a show for the crew. Ordinarily,
 it is difficult to see celestial objects from the Station while
 the lights are on, since the crew&#8217;s eyes are adjusted
 for the brighter conditions. &#8220;Mars was bright enough last
 summer that it was always out the window,&#8221; he said, explaining
 that it was visible even with the lights on.

<p>On being on a two-person crew with Malenchenko:
 &#8220;I learned
 to like, believe it or not, Russian rap music,&#8221; he said.
 &#8220;We got along great. We never had a single argument. We
 think a lot a like.&#8221; He said that he and Malenchenko were
 fortunate that they had similar philosophies about the mission,
 and that they each worked to be a good crewmate.
