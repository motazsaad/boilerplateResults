   NEDO will release issue No. 956 of the "NEDO Kaigai (Overseas)
 Report" on June 6, featuring the "Clean Development Mechanism
 (CDM) in Indonesia" and "Latest Trends on US Energy Legislation."
 The article on CDM is the second article focusing on this theme
 and follows an October 6, 2004 CDM article that appeared in
 issue No. 941. It contains current information on Indonesian
 CDM policies and project implementation. Both articles were
 compiled by NEDO's representative offices in Washington, D.C.
 and Jakarta.
   "NEDO Kaigai Report" is a biweekly publication
 and features news articles and summaries as well as other information
 related to the development of oil-alternative energy and industrial
 technology outside of Japan. Visitors to NEDO's Japanese-language
 Web site can download the report and individual articles in
 PDF format.
