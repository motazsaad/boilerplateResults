A downtown fixture since the '50s. Rightly famous for its omelettes
 (over 265 of them). Breakfast items are now served all day due
 to popular demand. The dinner menu is classic American fare.
 Homestyle cooking at its very best. Kids always welcome. Open
 daily for breakfast and lunch, Wednesday-Saturday for dinner.
