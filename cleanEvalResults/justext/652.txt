<h>STUDENT CONSERVATION TIPS

<p>Below is list of fun conservation ideas and projects that you,
 your family, friends, and teachers can enjoy!

<p>NATURE

<l>Identify as many species of birds as possible in the local park
 near your school. Call your local paper with the information,
 citing it as a good nature story for the community.

<l>Conduct a photography contest at your school focusing on animals.
 Ask a local newspaper photographer to judge. 

<l>Develop a nature themed bulletin board at your school. 

<l>Arrange for a school poster contest with an environmental or
 wildlife theme. 

<l>Make a bird feeder. Use various shapes and seed types to attract
 different species.  Keep a journal so you can identify feeding
 patterns as they emerge. 

<l>Study animals classified as endangered species; collect pictures
 of them; study them; discuss why they are endangered and what
 can be done to help save them. 

<l>Leaf collection - Collect as many leaves as possible. Identify
 them; trace them; make a collage. How many different species
 of trees are in your area? Make an album by putting leaves in
 a plastic photo album and labeling them. 

<l>Become an Environmental Shopper: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Reject
 and React.  Learn how to use your dollars to protect the environment.
 

<l>Start a composting pile at your school. 

<l>Make a worm bin to dispose of your garbage. 

<l> Conduct a waste audit at your school. Find out what can be recycled,
 what is being recycled and what more can be recycled. 

<l> Lobby your school board to buy products made from recycled materials
 (e.g. Recycled copier paper). 

<l> If you do not have curbside collection for recyclables in your
 community, campaign to have drop-off areas designated. 

<l> Organize a "Take the Pledge Not to Litter" campaign in your
 school to reduce litter. 

<l> Work with your local business community to provide attractive
 litter and recycling containers.   Obtain merchants' agreement
 to empty the containers with their trash or recyclables. 

<l> Become a litter basket for a day. Attach a brown bag to your
 clothing and collect any litter you encounter at your school.
   At the end of the day, put on a pair of gloves to examine
 the litter. Decide what can be recycled, composted, trashed
 or eliminated. (Caution children not to pick up unusual looking
 or hazardous waste.) 

<l>Contact your local library; ask the librarian to run a free slide
 or movie presentation on an environmental subject. 

<l>Arrange a visit to your local sewage treatment plant to increase
 your knowledge of how sewage is treated. 

<l>Plant a vegetable garden using old egg cartons to start your
 seeds. 

<l>Investigate if businesses and industries in your area have an
 environmental policy. 

<l>lnvite your school custodial staff to speak about the cleaning
 products they use. Try to find substitutes to replace those
 your research identifies as toxic or hazardous. 

<l>Develop an environmental newsletter for your school. 

<l> Find out how water pollution affects us. Have the children pour
 an inch of red food coloring into a glass. Then have them pour
 one inch of water into the glass. Stand a stalk of celery or
 a white flower into the glass. Let it stand overnight to see
 how the plant has absorbed the red water. Polluted water is
 absorbed in plants the same way. Discuss with the children how
 we can reduce the amount of pollutants getting into our plants
 and eventually to us. (e.g. Stop using chemical fertilizers.
 ) 

<l>Make a Mini-Landfill. Fill a pair of women's pantyhose with the
 following items: a foam egg carton, empty tin can, empty glass
 bottle, piece of newspaper, an apple core, chewed stick of gum,
 a piece of natural fiber, a plant clipping, and a plastic straw.
 Bury the filled pantyhose at least 8' deep, away from saturated
 soils. Mark the spot. After three months have passed, dig up
 the pantyhose from the ground and remove the contents carefully.
 Observe which materials have begun to biodegrade. Discuss with
 the children why this has happened. 

<l>Candleholders From Plastic Soda Bottles -  Have an adult cut
 the top off a 2-liter soda bottle (approximately six inches
 down). Trim the edges with a sharp pair of scissors. Make sure
 that the edge is even all around. Have the children decorate
 the holders by gluing various items to the holders (e.g. Use
 leftover scraps of paper or materials). Complete the project
 by adding a candle. 

<l>Soda Bottle Terrarium - Have an adult remove the neck of a 2-liter
 plastic soda bottle (hint - use the bottoms of the bottles used
 in #5 above). Cut the bottle with a knife.   Remove the label
 and the black plastic bottom. Place the bottle in hot water
 to remove the bottom more easily. Fill the black bottom with
 potting soil and place plants, rocks and figures into the soil.
 Water thoroughly. Take the clear plastic body of the bottle,
 turn it up side down and slide it into the black bottom, making
 a dome for the terrarium. 

<l>Participate in PRC's “Lens on Litter” photo contest. Submit photographs
 of the worst littered areas in your community to win prizes.
 

<l>Find out if any of your local parks have nature trails. If they
 don't, contact your local park board to help establish one.
 

<l>Write letters to companies that use too much packaging. 

<l>Study the voting records of elected officials (found in your
 local paper) to see how they vote on environmental issues. Write
 letters praising those with good records and urging those with
 poor records to do better. 

<l>Organize a safe clean-up of school grounds or other community
 sites; recycle the recyclables you collect.
