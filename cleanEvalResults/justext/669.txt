<p> Convicts collect pensions
   Jail term doesn't stop employee
 benefits

   Former Middletown school Superintendent Robert Sigler
 was busted last year for molesting a male student. He's still
 serving a 1ª- to five-year sentence.
   He gets to keep his
 pension of more than $21,000 a year.
   Warren Wagner, a former
 Middletown police detective, ripped off $20,000 worth of evidence
 money and served a year in a federal prison in 2002.
   He'll
 still get a pension shortly after his 55th birthday.
   They're
 not the only ones. New York is among the majority of states
 that leave pensions of public employees who commit serious offenses
 intact, whether the offense is related or unrelated to their
 jobs.
   That's good news for people like Ed Pilus, the former
 state police investigator sent to prison for faking fingerprints
 in at least two cases in Orange and Rockland counties. Pilus
 was released after serving almost two years in jail. They took
 his freedom, but they can't touch his pension.
   "It's unusual
 to me that someone can commit a crime while in public service
 and still be eligible for a pension," said William Darwak, the
 Ulster County administrator. "You'd think public employees would
 be held to a higher standard."
   Not in New York. The state's
 constitution doesn't allow pension benefits to be "diminished
 or impaired" for current public employees. Teachers and administrators
 are covered under a different system, the New York State Teachers'
 Retirement System, but the same rules apply.
   "There are no
 provisions in the statutes that would allow us to deny benefits
 to members," John Cardillo, the records access officer for the
 NYSTRS.
   That puts Seth Chase in the clear. Chase, a former
 teacher for the Golden Hill Elementary School, violated state
 Education Law by pinching and touching sixth-graders. He was
 fired in 1993 and has received more than $21,000 a year since;
 that's more than $231,000 in the past 11 years.
   Pensions
 are made up of a combination of employee contributions and tax
 dollars paid through the public employers, according to Dan
 Weiller, spokesman for the state Comptroller's Office. Investments
 also make up a chunk of the funds paid out in pensions.
   A
 person's pension amount, in most cases, is calculated from the
 salary of the last three years of employment as state employee.

   Pension forfeiture laws differ from state to state. Pennsylvania,
 for example, passed an act in 1978 that penalizes state employees
 who commit specific crimes through their office.
   The act
 requires not only the forfeiture of all pension and retirement
 benefits, except member contributions, but also any benefits
 for the member's beneficiaries and designated survivors. It
 even requires that the member contributions be used to pay fines
 and restitution associated with the conviction.
   The act applies
 to about 20 crimes ranging from extortion and theft to forgery
 and tampering with evidence.
   Oklahoma requires the forfeiture
 of pension benefits if "you are convicted of a felony or other
 crime which violates your oath of office."
   There aren't any
 states that make provisions for a law breaker whose offense
 doesn't pertain to his or her position. Same goes for those
 whose crimes are acknowledged but never prosecuted.
   That
 means Gary Pengel, a former Middletown police officer who admitted
 to molesting a little girl, still gets his $23,109 pension each
 year – all while serving a four- to 12-year prison term in the
 Collins Correctional Facility.
   Then there's former Monticello
 police Chief Michael Brennan and his pal, Sgt. Michael Bunce.
 These guys retired to avoid prosecution for running a side business
 of serving legal papers while on duty. They're both getting
 their annual pensions, $35,190 and $30,315 respectively.
  
 Pension experts argue pensions are "earned" benefits, meaning
 they shouldn't be rolled in as part of any sort of punishment.

   Changes to the state law that grants pensions to those convicted
 of crimes, most often involving official misconduct, have been
 proposed in the past, only to fall flat. But some New York city
 and state lawmakers are hoping to breath life into the issue
 again. In the past, Governor George Pataki voiced support for
 the idea, as did several other officials.
   Assemblywoman Nancy
 Calhoun said she'd consider a change to the law that hands out
 pensions to convicted criminals, but voiced reservations about
 the consequences of such a law.
   "You're taking away the security
 of the families as well," Calhoun said. "It would have to be
 looked at very carefully."
   Edward Farrell, the executive
 director of the New York State Conference of Mayors, said, "Conceptually,
 it's something we would likely support, but we'd have to look
 at how it would apply."
