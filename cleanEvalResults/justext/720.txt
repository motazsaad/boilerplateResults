<h>Hack job

<h>Don't hail Taxi, a tired comedy undermined by the acting of Jimmy
 Fallon (annoying) and Queen Latifah (on cruise control).

<h> By STEVE PERSALL, Times Film Critic
 Published October 7, 2004

<p> Catching a cab during Manhattan's rush hour is easier than finding
 a decent joke in Taxi, the latest film proving that a Not Ready
 for Prime Time Player isn't ready for the movies, either.

<p> Jimmy Fallon, arguably the most annoying Saturday Night Live
 performer since Joe Piscopo, goes the usual cops-and-robbers
 route taken by countless TV comedians hoping to become movie
 stars. As a cop, he's everything that would get a guy fired
 from the force. As a robber, he'll do just fine stealing moviegoers'
 money until they wise up.

<p> Fallon plays Andy Washburn, a discredit to New York's police
 department after plowing his cruiser into one of those fruit
 stands that never remains intact in sloppy action comedies.
 His boss, incredibly foxy Lt. Marta Robbins (Jennifer Esposito),
 even more incredibly dated Andy before her promotion, so he
 gets a little more leash. A muzzle would be more appropriate
 to stifle Fallon's nervous line deliveries.

<p> When a bank robbery occurs, Andy hails a cab driven by feisty
 Belle Williams, a walk-through role for Queen Latifah, Fallon's
 accomplice in ticket-sale crime. They can't stand each other,
 so they're perfect partners in such circumstances; he mumbles,
 she shrieks, and they act endangered while stunt drivers do
 all the hard work.

<p> It turns out the robberies are performed by a gang of hotties
 led by supermodel Gisele Bundchen. Even more unbelievable is
 Belle's taxi, a souped-up Crown Victoria that goes Transformer
 on occasion with air spoilers, a supercharger and cool rims.
 Nearly as unbelievable is that in a film titled Taxi, Andy and
 Belle spend so little time riding in one. This is something
 like Collateral with no interest.

<p> The plot slackens with intrusions by Belle's hunky lover (Henry
 Simmons) and Andy's alcoholic mother (Ann-Margret, who should
 be ashamed). Everyone plods through the obligatory explosions
 and gunfights, car wrecks that went out of style 20 years ago,
 and a brush with laughing gas when it's the audience that could
 use it. Tired stuff, and neither Fallon nor Latifah attempt
 anything to freshen it up.

<p> The only notable thing about Taxi is Twentieth Century Fox's
 handling of its opening date and advance screenings. The movie
 was supposed to open Friday, but screenings weren't scheduled
 until Wednesday night to keep critics from spreading the bad
 news too soon. Then Fox figured the news would be so bad that
 it opened the film on Wednesday to squeeze out a day or two
 of ticket sales before Fallon's comedy bits hit the pans.

<p> Here's the kicker: Fox already gave out tickets to free screenings
 Wednesday and tonight that are still planned, so a few hundred
 people will see the movie for free. They're still getting ripped
 off.
