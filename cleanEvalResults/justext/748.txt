<p>April 19, 2005

<p> 

<p>President Shirley M. Tilghman

<p>Office of the President

<p>1 Nassau Hall

<p>Princeton University

<p>Princeton, New Jersey 08544

<p> 

<p>URGENT

<p> 

<p>Sent by U.S. Mail and Facsimile (609-258-1615)

<p> 

<p>Dear President Tilghman:

<p> 

<p>As you can see from our Directors (including FIRE co-founders
 and Princeton University alumni Alan Charles Kors and Harvey
 Silverglate) and Board of Advisors, FIRE unites civil rights
 and civil liberties leaders, scholars, journalists, and public
 intellectuals across the political and ideological spectrum
 on behalf of liberty, due process, legal equality and&mdash;in
 the matter of the Princeton Faith and Action student group&mdash;voluntary
 association, freedom of speech, and religious liberty on America&rsquo;s
 college campuses.  Our web page, thefire.org, will give you
 a better sense of our identity and activities.

<p> 

<p>We consider this matter to be of the utmost urgency, with the
 most essential legal and moral values at stake.  We understand
 that Princeton University has refused to approve recognition
 for a Christian student organization, Princeton Faith and Action
 (PFA), because: (1) the group is affiliated with an outside
 religious organization not recognized for chaplaincy by the
 university and (2) the dean of religious life believes that
 the members of PFA can work with already existing groups that
 do &ldquo;similar things.&rdquo;  FIRE also understands that
 Princeton requires all religious student groups that seek to
 gain official recognition get an arbitrary &ldquo;approval&rdquo;
 from the dean of religious life before being permitted to apply
 for recognition.  These violations of Princeton&rsquo;s own
 written guarantees of freedom of speech, association, and religion
 are inexcusable at one of the nation&rsquo;s leading liberal
 arts institutions.

<p> 

<p>The following is our understanding of the facts, drawn from student
 reports and other sources.  Please correct any factual errors,
 if they exist.  Matt Bennett is the founder and president of
 Christian Union, a non-profit ministry founded in 2002

<p>
that is dedicated to working with and providing resources to
 Christian and non-Christian students at the eight Ivy League
 universities.  Between January of 2002 and the autumn of 2004,
 Bennett had corresponded with Dean of Religious Life Thomas
 Breidenthal to discuss the process of attaining recognition
 for Christian Union as a campus chaplaincy at Princeton.  During
 their correspondence, Dean Breidenthal never gave Christian
 Union an opportunity to submit an official application for chaplaincy
 as outlined in the university&rsquo;s &ldquo;Policy Statement
 Regarding Recognition of Campus Ministers,&rdquo; nor was the
 group&rsquo;s potential for chaplaincy evaluated based on the
 criteria listed in that policy.  

<p> 

<p>In September of 2004, Dean Breidenthal informed the Reverend
 Richard Linderman, a Christian Union Advisory Board member,
 that he had decided not to recognize Christian Union for chaplaincy.
  Dean Breidenthal stated that the reasons for this decision
 were that: (1) Christian Union was a relatively new organization
 and needed to develop a track record; (2) another campus chaplain
 had complained about Christian Union scheduling a Bible study
 at the same time as one of that chaplain&rsquo;s meetings; and
 (3) Christian Union had met with Vice President of Campus Life
 Janet Dickerson without first notifying Dean Breidenthal.

<p> 

<p>During January to February of 2005, Manna Christian Fellowship
 (MCF), a recognized student group, attempted to reserve a room
 on campus to host a Sunday morning event as part of an April
 conference organized by the Christian Union in Princeton, New
 Jersey.  Dean Breidenthal informed MCF that it could not host
 Christian Union&rsquo;s Sunday event because it would be a &ldquo;violation
 of University policy&rdquo; to reserve the room for an &ldquo;outside
 group.&rdquo;  Dean Breidenthal instead directed MCF to tell
 Christian Union to reserve a room through Princeton&rsquo;s
 Conference Services.  Christian Union attempted to do so, but
 its request was denied because Conference Services required
 that the organization have prior approval from the dean of religious
 life.

<p> 

<p>Since Christian Union could neither attain recognition as a chaplaincy
 nor reserve spaces on campus, by March of 2005 Princeton students
 associated with Christian Union had organized into a group called
 Princeton Faith and Action (PFA) in order to seek recognition
 as an official student organization.  When the group&rsquo;s
 leaders approached the Student Government Student Group Recognition
 Committee (SGRC) to apply for official recognition, they were
 instructed to meet with Dean Breidenthal to get his approval
 first. 

<p> 

<p>On April 7, 2005, Cameron Young and Rachel Blair, the president
 and treasurer of PFA, respectively, met with Dean Breidenthal
 to discuss recognition for PFA.  At the meeting, Dean Breidenthal
 denied PFA approval to apply for recognition with the SGRC.
  His reasons were that (1) recognizing PFA would mean &ldquo;recognizing
 Christian Union de facto&rdquo; and (2) the members of PFA could
 engage in similar activities with existing campus religious
 groups.  

<p> 

<p>When the students asked Dean Breidenthal why recognizing Christian
 Union would be a problem, he told them that the issue was &ldquo;confidential&rdquo;
 and refused to discuss it.  He further told them that he did
 not want PFA to become an &ldquo;arm of the Christian Union
 on campus.&rdquo;  When the students pointed out that other
 religious student organizations existed on campus without corresponding
 recognized chaplaincies, the dean stated that his hope was for
 such groups (such as the Seventh-Day Adventists and the Muslim
 student group) to eventually become campus ministries with full-time
 chaplains.  

<p> 

<p>The dean suggested that, as an alternative, the students work
 with MCF to organize their activities.  According to the students,
 when they explained that they already attempted to do so, the
 dean responded: &ldquo;Not Christian Union conferences.  I don&rsquo;t
 want you to be a way for Christian Union to hold their conferences
 on campus.&rdquo;  

<p> 

<p>At the close of the meeting, the students expressed concern that
 requiring religious student groups to gain special approval
 was discriminatory since other student groups do not have the
 same requirements.  The dean&rsquo;s response was that this
 was &ldquo;the way things were done&rdquo; at Princeton.  

<p> 

<p>Dean Breidenthal&rsquo;s decision to forbid PFA from associating
 with the ministry of its choice denies PFA members the right
 of free association and threatens the freedoms of association
 and religion of all of Princeton&rsquo;s students.  Furthermore,
 Dean Breidenthal&rsquo;s decision appears to have been based
 on an earlier decision to not recognize Christian Union for
 reasons entirely unrelated to the normal procedure for recognizing
 a ministry for campus chaplaincy.  

<p> 

<p>Princeton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Policy Statement Regarding Recognition
 of Campus Ministers&rdquo; states that:

<p>Princeton University seeks to promote the presence of a vigorous
 and diverse religious community on campus, to foster interfaith
 dialogue, understanding and co-operation within that community,
 and to encourage its active participation in the public discourse
 of the University. To this end, Princeton University welcomes
 the presence of a wide range of denominational and non-denominational
 ministries reflecting all faiths and religious traditions.[Emphasis
 added.]

<p>The policy further states that:

<p>All applications for recognition originate from a religious council,
 church or other religious body. The University does not consider
 applications from individuals. The sending agency submits its
 application in writing to the Dean of the Chapel and of Religious
 Life, along with a resum&eacute; of the individual it is nominating,
 a written commitment to pay his or her salary as campus minister,
 and evidence of medical insurance. Recognition is conferred
 by the Dean, in consultation with the Vice-President for Campus
 Life. [Emphasis added.]

<p>Christian Union was not given the opportunity to send an application
 as detailed in the policy.  In fact, it would have been futile
 to do so, since Dean Breidenthal had already made it clear in
 conversations and in several emails that he would not consider
 Christian Union for recognition.  As he stated in a February
 21, 2005, email, &ldquo;authoriz[ing] use of a campus venue
 [for Christian Union&rsquo;s conference]&hellip;would not be
 consonant with this office&rsquo;s decision not to recognize
 Christian Union as a Princeton University Ministry.&rdquo; 
 This revealing statement indicates that Dean Breidenthal had
 ruled out a chaplaincy for Christian Union before the group
 had even submitted an application.

<p> 

<p>This ongoing violation of the freedom of association and religious
 liberty of Princeton&rsquo;s religious students is unconscionable
 in light of the clear statements protecting students&rsquo;
 rights in the university&rsquo;s statement on &ldquo;Rights,
 Rules and Responsibilities.&rdquo;  If Dean Breidenthal is right
 and this is indeed &ldquo;the way things are done&rdquo; at
 Princeton, the university is in violation of its own policies
 on &ldquo;Campus Associations and Activities,&rdquo; which promise
 that:

<p>Students engaging in extracurricular activities on campus are
 free to form organizations devoted to a wide variety of objectives,
 and, as individuals or members of organizations, to express
 their views on issues of University and public interest&hellip;.
 University recognition will not be withheld from any group pursuing
 lawful objectives merely because its aims may seem unorthodox.
  [Emphasis added.]

<p>Dean Breidenthal&rsquo;s apparently arbitrary method of decision-making
 simply cannot be reconciled with Princeton&rsquo;s promises.
  

<p> 

<p>Princeton&rsquo;s policies also state that: 

<p>Student organizations may invite outside speakers of their choice,
 and are free to hold meetings and in other ways to express their
 views, subject only to prudent conditions regarding the protection
 of people and property and to reasonable regulations concerning
 time, place, and notice of meetings and other public exercises&hellip;.
 These policies are intended tosafeguard the rights of students
 and student organizations to freedom of association.  [Emphasis
 added]

<p>Dean Breidenthal&rsquo;s prohibition on MCF&rsquo;s hosting Christian
 Union for a Sunday conference event on campus violates the guarantee
 to student organizations that they may &ldquo;invite outside
 speakers of their choice.&rdquo;  Instead of &ldquo;safeguard[ing]
 the rights of students and student organizations to freedom
 of association,&rdquo; Princeton&rsquo;s actions have threatened
 the rights at least two religious groups on campus.  Indeed,
 the fact that religious student groups must obtain the arbitrary
 approval of Dean Breidenthal grants him the power to censor
 religious groups without restriction or recourse.  Non-religious
 student groups are not required to undergo such an administrative
 litmus test in order to apply for recognition.  This policy
 constitutes a shameful and illiberal double standard.

<p> 

<p>If Princeton is to allow expressive organizations to exist on
 its campus at all, it should allow religious organizations to
 exist, to define their missions, to select their own members,
 and to establish policies, practices, and associations with
 other groups in pursuit of their goals.  No group can control
 the delivery of its message if it is unable to determine its
 expressive purpose, membership, and activities.  This principle
 is explained well by the U.S. Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision
 in Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640 (2000).  In this
 decision, the Court pointed out that &ldquo;implicit in the
 right to engage in activities protected by the First Amendment
 is a corresponding right to associate with others in pursuit
 of a wide variety of political, social, economic, educational,
 religious, and cultural ends.&rdquo;  This right, the Court
 proclaimed, is &ldquo;crucial in preventing the majority from
 imposing its views on groups that would rather express other,
 perhaps unpopular, ideas.&rdquo;  

<p> 

<p>In addition, the Court has ruled that public institutions are
 required to grant religious organizations equal access to campus
 facilities (seeWidmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 (1981)), and
 are also required to grant religious organizations equal access&mdash;on
 a viewpoint neutral basis&mdash;to student fee funding.  See
 Rosenberger v. University of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819 (1995) and
 Board of Regents v. Southworth, 529 U.S. 217 (2000).  As a private
 institution with policies guaranteeing freedom of association
 on campus, Princeton should follow the Court&rsquo;s example
 in protecting the same fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the
 First Amendment, lest students at one of the nation&rsquo;s
 most prestigious universities be left with fewer rights than
 they would have had at their local community college.

<p> 

<p>Princeton should be aware that FIRE has successfully concluded
 religious liberty and freedom of association cases at other
 private universities facing similar situations.  For example,
 at the Catholic University of America (CUA), FIRE defended the
 right of students to organize an NAACP chapter on campus after
 CUA attempted to prevent its recognition by claiming its existence
 would be &ldquo;redundant&rdquo; and that it would violate the
 university&rsquo;s adherence to Catholic beliefs by being &ldquo;pro-choice.&rdquo;
  After FIRE reminded CUA of its obligation to legal equality
 and its own promises of students&rsquo; rights to freedom of
 association, CUA decided to recognize the NAACP student chapter.
  You may wish to read more about FIRE&rsquo;s efforts to defend
 free speech, religious freedom, and freedom of association on
 these and other campuses across the nation at thefire.org.

<p> 

<p>FIRE requests that Princeton University act immediately to correct
 this ongoing injustice by officially recognizing Princeton Faith
 and Action as well as any other faith-based groups that may
 have been denied the right to recognition by the dean of religious
 life for similar reasons.  Only by doing this can Princeton
 restore to its students the essential rights of freedom of religion
 and association guaranteed by its own policies.  FIRE furthermore
 requests that Princeton administrators review the institution&rsquo;s
 legal and moral obligations to treat expressive student organizations
 equally and according to the university&rsquo;s promises.  Honoring
 the rights and dignities of its students does not mean that
 Princeton endorses the particular message or associations of
 any particular student group&mdash;it signifies only that the
 university recognizes and respects the basic liberties that
 belong to all of its students. 

<p> 

<p>We hope to see this matter resolved with fairness, common sense,
 and respect for the principle of legal equality.  Because of
 the urgency of this situation and the continuing violation of
 religious students&rsquo; rights, we request that you that you
 respond to us by 5 p.m. on Tuesday, April 26, 2005.

<p> 

<p>Sincerely, 

<p> 

<p>David French

<p>President
