 TEACHERS and other employees of non-government aided colleges
 of Punjab and Chandigarh are, once again, protesting against
 the denial of their long-standing demands. They are asking for
 pension, gratuity and other benefits. And once again, the academic
 atmosphere is bound to be disturbed, then their demands conceded
 with customary fanfare and then, as always, completely forgotten.

<p>CONCERNED at the high dropout rate in schools, a declining sex
 ratio and a marked difference in literacy levels of boys and
 girls of the city, the Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan has come as a boon
 for girl students with the scheme offering free textbooks to
 them till the primary level and free computer education upto
 Class VIII. 

<p>While the girl students in government schools were exempted from
 payment of tuition fee till Class XII, the benefit of free textbooks
 has come as an added advantage, making studies practically free
 for them. Sanctioned under “Innovative projects” of the SSA,
 the incentive is aimed at educating the girlchild and reducing
 the gap in literacy levels between boys and girls.

<p>“We had been alarmed at the decreasing number of girl students
 in classrooms. when SSA came our way, We prepared a special
 project on the education scenario in the city with special reference
 to the girl child and presented it to the Government of India.
 Taking note of our concerns, we were given a sum of Rs 50 lakh
 under the project to uplift the girl child,” says Mr DS Mangat,
 DPI (Schools), Chandigarh.

<p>Of the total amount sanctioned for the project under SSA, Rs
 35 lakh have been given for distribution of free textbooks till
 Class V to all girl students and another Rs 15 lakh have come
 for imparting computer education to them. Computers are taught
 from Class V to Class VIII in government schools.

<p>Though this project is to be implemented from this month onwards,
 with most students already having bought the books for this
 session, the Chandigarh Education Department is likely to reimburse
 the amount spent by the students. 

<p>With the sex ratio coming down from 790 in 1991 to 773 in 2001,
 the city has a dropout rate of 17.92 per cent in the case of
 girls against 7.94 per cent of boys at the upper primary level.
 Though the literacy level has gone up from 70.43 per cent in
 1971 to 81.76 per cent, the literacy rate is higher among boys
 at 85.65 against 76.65 per cent among girls.

<p>The low literacy level among girls in the city is attributed
 to the unwillingness of parents, especially those staying in
 slums, to send girls to school. They prefer to send them to
 work in houses nearby and add to the family's meagre income
 instead of spending on fee and books. 

<p>Interestingly, the census survey revealed that 18,614 girls were
 going to school against 21, 198 boys till the primary level
 while the total number of girls attending school from Class
 VI to VIII was 11,425 against 12, 515 boys.

<p>TEACHERS and other employees of non-government aided colleges
 of Punjab and Chandigarh are, once again, protesting against
 the denial of their long-standing demands. They are asking for
 pension, gratuity and other benefits. And once again, the academic
 atmosphere is bound to be disturbed, then their demands conceded
 with customary fanfare and then, as always, completely forgotten.

<p>In 1992 the Punjab government made a promise that these employees
 would be granted pension and other benefits on a par with their
 counterparts in government colleges. Many agitations later,
 some drafts of pension schemes (usually with modifications contrary
 to the interests of the employees), were approved by subsequent
 governments. But none implemented. The party in power today
 highlighted this ‘just and genuine’ demand in its manifesto
 during their election campaign. And there the matter rests —
 moribund.

<p>Meanwhile, employees of such colleges are a demoralised lot.
 Many have since retired with meagre retiral benefits. This is
 so because the amounts due to them as gratuity are seldom paid.
 The amount of Contributory Provident Fund they received is not
 even half of their lawful entitlement since the statutory provisions
 concerning the deduction of subscription to their C.P.F are
 disregarded by college managements and funding governments.

<p>For instance, in case of such colleges in Chandigarh and Punjab,
 affiliated to Panjab University, and funded by the Chandigarh
 Administration and the Government of Punjab, respectively, the
 deduction of the subscription to the employees’ C.P.F. is calculated
 at the rate of 10% of their basic pay alone. This contravenes
 the relevant provisions of the P.U. calendar, which clearly
 state that the rate of subscription shall be 10% of salary and
 salary for C.P.F. deductions means — pay plus all allowances
 excluding HRA”.

<p>The exclusion of other allowances, like D.A., while calculating
 subscription to C.P.F. several truncates the only means of sustenance
 such employees have after retirement.

<p>It needs to be noted that Panjab University, which gets grants
 from both Punjab and the Chandigarh Administration, follows
 these rules for its own employees. It contributes a matching
 10% subscription on the basic and DA to its own employees, but
 allows colleges to get away with this step-motherly treatment
 to their employees. In the process, it ignores its statutory
 duty to oversee that its service rules and Provident Fund provisions
 are scrupulously followed by affiliated colleges.

<p>Even the Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions
 Act, 1952, clearly defines that the salary wages for C.P.F.
 deductions shall include — “basic wages, dearness allowances,
 (including cash value of any food concession) and retaining
 allowances if any”. 

<p>Thus, the general, overriding, mandatory provision in the Act,
 the bedrock of all P.F. legislation in India, and the rules
 framed by Panjab University, are not being followed in the colleges
 affiliated with Panjab University.

<p>It must be mentioned that the rate of deduction from salary for
 C.P.F. has been enhanced by the Centre from 10% to 12% with
 effect from May1, 1997. No such enhancement on even the basic
 pay has been granted to the employees of the colleges.

<p>Thus, for the past so many years, while teachers and other employees
 have been awaiting implementation of a viable pension policy,
 they have lost out on their legitimate claims as regards C.P.F.
 Umpteem representations to the authorities concerned have failed
 to yield any results. 

<p>Another distressing trend is discernible. It seems that in a
 bid to escape paying permissible dues like annual increments,
 D.A., H.R.A. or C.P.F., the powers that be are devising novel
 methods. New recruitments, if any, are mostly on ad hoc, contractual
 and temporary basis. These appointees are not entitled to any
 of the statutory allowances.
