<h>The Surreal Gourmet

<p>Website of the Day: Thursday 24th February 2005

<p> &gt;&gt; The Surreal Gourmet
This is cookery for people who
 don’t much like cooking: “For those with a sense of culinary
 adventure The Surreal Gourmet serves up fresh attitude towards
 cooking and entertaining and shows you how dysfunctional kitchens,
 mismatched dinnerware and low budgets can be easily overcome
 by a little creativity and an armful of fresh ingredients!”
 
If you're wondering what the picture on the right of this text
 is all about, that would be the site's legendary recipe for
 Beer-Can chicken!

<h>Book Crossing

<p>Website of the Day: Tuesday 22nd February 2005

<p>&gt;&gt; Book Crossing
I first mentioned this site nearly three
 years ago, and where Radio 2 leads, Australia’s leading soap
 follows; Book Crossing featured in a Neighbours storyline last
 week! Aimed at book lovers, the site invites you to “Set your
 books free and make the whole world a library” – The idea
 is that when you’re finished with a book, instead of letting
 it languish on a shelf, you pass it on by leaving it in a public
 place for a stranger to find and enjoy. Each book is allocated
 a unique ID number so you can track its progress and find reviews
 from other readers.

<h>Chip Cartoon Characters

<p> Yesterday in the course of our conversation about National Chip
 Week Steve asked if a chip or French fry has ever ever had a
 starring role in a film or TV series. So a resounding hats off
 to listener Paul Callow who emailed to to tip us off about the
 existence a crime fighting box of chips named Frylock. Frylock
 is one of the stars of an overnight show on Cartoon Network
 in the US called Aqua Teen Huger Force. More info on the Cartoon
 Network site.

<h>Audiobooks For Free

<p>Website of the Day: Thursday February 17th 2005

<p> &gt;&gt; Audiobooks For Free
From the “does what it says on
 the tin” school of sites, here’s a handy source for novels,
 poetry or non fiction to listen to in the gym, on the move,
 at home or at work. Around 500 titles are available as free
 mp3 downloads, mainly (but not exclusively) classics that are
 out-of-copyright. The audio is optimised for small file sizes
 and quick download … which means that at best it sounds like
 an old recording from a short-wave radio, but you can elect
 to pay a small charge to download a higher-quality recording.

<p>Website of the Day: Wednesday February 16th 2005

<p> &gt;&gt; Love Chips
We’re currently in the middle of National
 Chip Week 2005, so it seems a good time to draw your attention
 to this site celebrating the nation’s favourite fast food.
 Features include the strangely addictive online games Chip Ahoy
 and Chippy-Uppy, Russell Grant’s chip astrology, and a fascinating
 guide to chip eating styles which explains how the way we choose
 and consume our chips reflects our personality types.

<h>How to contact your MP

<p>Website of the Day: Tuesday February 15th 2005 

<p> &gt;&gt; Write to Them
This is an enhanced version of a site
 that was originally launched as FaxYourMP. It was put together
 by a bunch of volunteers to address the fact that many people
 don't know the name of their MP, let alone how to contact them:
 The site was designed to make the whole process of finding and
 contacting your elected representative as easy as possible.
 The new site expands the service to include local councillors,
 MEPs and members of the National Assemblies for Scotland Wales
 and Northern Ireland. To use the site, simply type in your postcode
 to find details of all your representatives, choose who to write
 to, type your letter into an online form, and click send!

 personality love quiz, the chance to vote for your dream Albert
 Square valentine, video clips of classic Eastenders kisses and
 weddings, a range of Valentines E-cards and a romantic Alfie

<h>A prickle of porcupines… 

<p>Miles, Ever wondered what the term for a group of jellyfish is?
 Check out this site: http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/info/faqs/animals/names.htm
Chris
 
P.S. it's a "smack" of jellyfish! 

<p>So I decided to investigate Collective Nouns further and it turns
 out there are hundreds of different sites detailing the collective
 nouns for different groupings of people, animals and objects.
 One of the more comprehensive is Paul Vijay’s collection of
 collective nouns but you may also want to try the Collective
 Noun quiz at Triv.net

<h>Send A Little Love

<p>Website of the Day: Tuesday 08 February 2005

<p> &gt;&gt; Send A Little Love
This was conceived primarily as
 a feel-good personal tribute site, offering a cheap online equivalent
 to the Births, Deaths and Marriages and personal message classifieds
 in the daily papers. Anyone can view the site and search for
 tributes – If you want to post a tribute, a fee of £6 buys
 you twenty messages. In addition the site offers a useful (and
 completely free) Never Forget email reminder service. Register
 to add details of birthdays and anniversaries and the site will
 send you an email reminder a few days before the event.

<h>Online Simon

<p>Website of the Day: Friday 04 February 2005

<p> &gt;&gt; Online Simon
When I was growing up, Simon was the original
 addictive electronic game. The only thing this online recreation
 lacks is the tactility. Highly enjoyable and pleasurably nostalgic!

<p>
If you want to try some of the other online games which have
 been recommended on Website of the Day since May 2004, check

<h>Who is Jim Wilson?

<p>Website of the Day: Thursday 03 February 2005

<p> &gt;&gt; Jim Wilson.Com
Taking a leaf out of Dave Gorman’s
 book, this site is dedicated to “promoting the universe of
 all Jim Wilsons. At the time of writing, 51 Jim Wilson’s are
 listed and profiled, most of them American, but if your name
 is Jim Wilson and you’d like to join JW31 of Manchester, JW34
 of Hayling Island and JW50 of Essex to improve the UK’s representation,
 simply submit your details to JW0001.

<h>BBC Voices

<p>Website of the Day: Wednesday 02nd February

<p> &gt;&gt; BBC Voices
This site is part of a big pan-BBC project
 looking at local and regional accents and dialect. On air the
 main focus for this will be a week of programmes at the end
 of August, but the online component is up and running – and
 very interesting! 
Start off by submitting details of your age,
 where you live and grew up, how you’d describe your own accent
 and whether you speak any other languages. Then try out the
 Interactive Word Map, in which you submit the words you use
 to describe your grandparents, a baby, feeling cold or tired,
 or being drunk, pregnant or rich. 
Over time the site will build
 up a fascinating picture of how our age, location and background
 affect the language we use and our accents.

<h>How to declutter your life

<p>Website of the Day: Tuesday 1st February

<p> &gt;&gt; FlyLady
Thanks to Fiona Stow for her email encouraging
 me to revisit this site which I first mentioned a couple of
 years ago: 

<p>"I firmly believe that if the website address was displayed in
 doctors' waiting rooms and plastered across women's magazines,
 the anti-depressant statistics in this country would plunge!"

<p>FlyLady is a de-cluttering bible for SHEs (Sidetracked Home Executives)
 or anyone who lives in CHAOS (that's Can't Have Anyone Over
 Syndrome). Some UK readers may find Fly Lady's constant email
 reminders &amp; apple-pie tone overwhelming, but there is a
 lot of genuinely useful advice here for people who haven’t
 seen their carpets or work-surfaces in recent weeks!
