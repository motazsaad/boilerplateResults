Conference Computing Checklist

<p>Simply notify SLAC SCCS computing support by sending e-mail to
 conference-comp@slac.stanford.edu if you have an upcoming conference
 which may have computing needs, and we will contact you to discuss
 what is needed. 

<p>It is important that conference-comp gets time to plan your needs
 with you and mobilize any resources necessary, so please do
 not hold off contacting us if you do not yet know the details.
 The checklist below is just a reference. If you have doubts
 as to whether your conference needs any computing resources,
 please just notify conference-comp anyways.

<p>
  

<p>Computing at conferences and meetings can be complex, e.g.,

<l> projector set up with a computer (some need network access)

<l> network access for laptops

<l> printing for producing committee reports and papers

<l> visitors not able to log onto SLAC computers to write reports
 (if conference is on site) 

<l> workstations needed for different purposes and different types
 of software

<l> database access (databases residing on a server and accessed
 from web interface)

<l> etc. 

<p>In order for you to plan and implement this properly at conferences,
 we need the sponsors of the conference to work with SCCS and
 other computing staff at SLAC. We need to plan and work with
 you on a sensible setup, so that for a temporary and mobile
 conference setup, you can obtain the desired functionality without
 having to replicate the complex SLAC infrastructure that you
 have come to expect at your SLAC office.

<p>Please go over this checklist and send e-mail to conference-comp
 list so that someone can contact you to discuss this. A secondary
 purpose of the checklist is to alert you of the complexities
 and guide you to think through the implementation in a timely
 manner.

<p> SCCS and computing staff from other SLAC departments can provide
 consulting to plan the resources needed to meet your needs.
 To make your conference computing as easy as possible, you are
 urged to involve the computing staff in the planning from the
 beginning. The sponsors are responsible to find and fund the
 resources needed.

<p>We would appreciate if past and future conference organizers
 will contribute to this web page to concentrate our experiences.
 Please send e-mail to conference-comp.

Checklist

<p>
 Do you need? 

<p> Description 

<p> SLAC Person to Contact 

<p> Cost 

<p> When to do this 

<p>Initial planning between the SCCS contact and the conference
 computing contact

<p>Do this first.  This will allow you and the computing staff to:
 

<l>identify the computing people responsible and the resources needed

<l>understand what you expect for computing at the  conference

<l>what infrastructure to set up at the conference in coordination
 with other computing staff at SLAC

<p>Contact conference-compfirst, in order to involve SCCS and other
 computing staff.

<p>On-site:
 How many people will be bringing laptops?
 How many
 laptop users will need internet access?
 For those not bringing
 laptops, is e-mail, telnet and web browsing needed?
 Is the
 ability to write files to the local C drive or to the floppy
 drive needed to produce reports?
 Is printing needed?
 Is access
 to SLAC Windows file servers needed?
 Is access to 'slaconly'
 web pages needed? 

<p>Off-site:
 Which is the vendor that the conference site uses?

 Recommended is DHCP for workstations, fixed IP addresses for
 printers supplied by vendor. 

<p>
 How many people need access?
 Is e-mail, telnet and web browsing
 needed?
 Is writing files to the local C drive needed?
 Is access
 to SLAC Windows file servers needed?
 Is access to 'slaconly'
 web pages needed?

<p>
 Will the operating system and software need re-installing,
 and by whom?
 Do you need to know the local workstation accounts
 (for NT/Linux)?

<p>?

<p> 

<p> 

<p> Types of functions PC's will be used for (different software,
 etc.) 

<p>What is the software you expect (here is the SLAC standard suite
 for conference NT's)?
 Will some PC's have different software?

 Are there any version incompatibilities (e.g., Microsoft Access
 97 vs Access 2000)?

<p>What models of printers?  
 Are printer drivers loaded onto each
 workstation?
 Do you need parallel port printer cables?
 Are
 printers on fixed IP addresses, and do these printer addresses
 need to be loaded onto each workstations?

<p>Do they expect to be networked?
 Do they expect to print (recommended
 to use parallel port printer cable)?  If expected to print,
 do you have printer drivers for all operating systems expected?

<p>At the conference do you need to access SLAC resources behind
 the SLAC firewall (such as SLAC Windows files to modify papers
 and talks)?
 Recommended is Citrix Windows Terminal Server client.

<p>?

<p>  

<p>  

<p> Moving PC equipment 

<p>Who will be responsible for moving, setup and cleanup?

<p>?

<p>  

<p>  

<p> Computer support at the conference 

<l>Who will be there full time at the conference as computer support
 to troubleshoot network, installs, file formats, printing, projector,
 etc.

<l>Has this person been given the local administrator or local root
 accounts for the workstations to have full privilege to configure?

<l> Has this person been given CD's of all operating systems, service
 packs, software and printer drivers, printer and network cables
 to troubleshoot at conference site?

<p>?

<p>  

<p>This person should be identified early and involved in from the
 planning stage.

<p> Database 

<l>Who is the owner or programmer for the database?

<l>Is database on the server?

<l>Does database have web interfaces?

<l>Does database have any passwords?

<l>Does database file have permissions based on SLAC accounts (not
 valid outside SLAC network)? 

<p>Professional vendors who provide conference registration, conference
 networking, conference computer setup may be the most efficient
 way. Few people realize the amount of complex work involved
 in setting up computing services for a big conference, and SLAC
 internal resources are limited and not optimized for this. 

<p>  

<p>  

<p>  

<p> Testing the conference setup 

<p>What tests will be done?  
 Will the tests be done in time to
 make changes?
 Will tests  involve verifying that network taps
 are active, projector, workstations, accounts to be used, software,
 printing, file transfer, file sharing, database (do tests need
 to include SLAC network, and disconnected from SLAC network)?

 Who is responsible for the testing and verification for sign-off?
