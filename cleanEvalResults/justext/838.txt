<p>Finally: WoodyBox is back with his third, and maybe yet another
 groundbreaking article:
 "The Secret Hijacking -The Fifth Plane
 landed in Cleveland..."

<p>
 "...The thesis of the secret hijacked airplane helps to explain
 many hitherto unsolved peculiarities of 9/11. It looks like
 the existence of this flight was meant to be hidden from the
 public by interested circles, so the question arises: Why was
 it kept secret? And of course it would be interesting to find
 out the airport where Flight X started..."

<h>The Secret Hijacking

<h>
 The Fifth Plane landed in Cleveland - by Woody Box
 August
 17, 2004

<h>Introduction

<h>Advise to the reader: This text is the continuation of my previous
 article The Cleveland Airport Mystery, so you should take a
 look at that first if you don't know it. Here is a short summary:

<p>
 In the morning of September 11, Delta Flight 1989 made an emergency
 landing at Cleveland Airport. This is a well established fact.
 Less known to the public is that another airplane landed under
 similar circumstances about half an hour later, on a different
 runway. This second airplane is confirmed by news reports and
 eyewitnesses, but its existence is covered under a murky haze
 of disregard. I've called it "Flight X".

<p>
 The purpose of this analysis is to find out more about Flight
 X. Browsing through documents and private messages from September
 11, we will encounter two airplanes whose existence seems to
 have been kept secret in a similar way. These airplanes are
 then checked for possible correspondences with Flight X. We
 will reconstruct a flight path for Flight X which is not proven
 in a criminalistic sense, but fits the facts much better than
 any other scenario...

<p>
 The first airplane under inspection is the "Fifth Plane". Many
 people remember the broadcast media reporting a fifth hijacked
 airplane for a short time in the morning of September 11. Distingishing
 it from other "fifth" airplanes on September 11 like a Korean
 Airlines jet which was diverted to Alaska, and also from some
 "fifth" airplanes reported in the days after the attacks (allegedly
 attempted or stalled hijackings), the Fifth Plane I'm talking
 about has four characteristics: 1) it was widely broadcasted
 between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m., even abroad; 2) it was said to
 be hijacked; 3) it was heading for Camp David/Washington D.C.,
 but was distingished from UA 93; 4) it vanished from the news
 as if it never had existed, without any explanation.

<p>
 The second airplane is the "Radio Hijacker Plane". A lot of
 people know the distorted audio messages which were allegedly
 sent by the hijackers of UA 93: "Keep remaining sitting, we
 have a bomb on board". Air controllers and pilots reported also
 screams coming from this airplane.

<p>
 In a kind of "airplane algebra" I will show now that with a
 high degree of probability

<p>
 - the "Fifth Plane" existed

<p>
 - the "Radio Hijacker Plane" was not UA 93

<p>
 - Flight X from Cleveland, the "Radio Hijacker Plane", and
 the "Fifth Plane", are the same plane.

<p>
 According to the local radio station WCPO, quoted in the "Cleveland
 Airport Mystery", United Airlines confirmed that Flight 93 had
 landed in Cleveland, i.e. Flight X = UA 93. I have already expressed
 my reservations against this short, cryptic and uncorroborated
 report, and this article will show that the opposite is true.
 Flight X is not UA 93.

<h>The Fifth Plane

<p>
 The Fifth Plane existed. Here is a sample of Internet messages.

<p>In and among the tidal wave of coverage, most of which was the
 same stuff from differing angles, I heard a reporter say that
 FIVE planes had been hijacked. Later in the day I heard about
 only four with no explanation of why they had said five earlier.Source

<p>One of the things I want to know is why all morning I heard reports
 about a fifth plane that had been hijacked, one without a known
 location. The question I asked myself is: how you can lose an
 airliner, and why that piece of news seems to have gone away.Source

<p>I am so glad that someone else heard that about the 5th plane.
 I thought I was losing my mind! I kept asking about the 5th
 plane and no one but me had heard that particular report. I
 could have sworn that I heard there were 5 planes. Don't know
 if the 5th one was hi-jacked or just flying off course. Source

<p>Ok, the plane that crashed near Pittsburg crashed in a large
 field that just coincidentally happens to be near an air force
 base. We pretty much think it got blown out of the sky around
 here. In addition, earlier they kept talking about a second
 missing plane they believed was heading toward Washington, but
 suddenly all talk of that disappeared. Anyone know what happened
 to it?Source

<p>There was a point on Tuesday when I am absolutely sure that a
 fifth plane was reported as being "intercepted" by Air Force
 fighter jets and was now "no longer a threat," which to me sounds
 like a euphemism for "shot down." Mid-day Tuesday this was being
 reported as fact, and now there's not a word of it anywhere.
 So strange is the turnaround in official facts that it almost
 feels like I imagined it. I'm betting on enforced news blackouts....Source

<p>For example, after Flight 93 had crashed the media was still
 reporting a plane in the air, heading toward DC. Was this just
 that the implications of 93's crash hadn't filtered to the news
 desk, or was there another plane?Source

<p>The strange thing is that I was scanning the radio from right
 after the first crash and I kept hearing, repeatedly, that there
 was a plane heading for the wh/cd. First it was described as
 a fourth plane, but after that one was reported down in PA,
 it was reported that there was a fifth plane heading for the
 wh/cd.Source

<p>
 These messages cannot be dismissed as reflections of pure rumours
 because a fifth plane was also noticed by a multi-agency video
 conference on September 11: At 10:03, the conference received
 reports of more missing aircraft, &ldquo;2 possibly 3 aloft,&rdquo;and
 learned of a combat air patrol over Washington. (9/11 report,
 p.36)

<p>
 It was also noticed in Washington D.C. by some very important
 people - after the crash of UA 93:

<p>At 10:02, the communicators in the shelter began receiving reports
 from the Secret Service of an inbound aircraft &mdash;presumably
 hijacked &mdash;heading toward Washington. That aircraft was
 United 93. The Secret Service was getting this information directly
 from the FAA. The FAA may have been tracking the progress of
 United 93 on a display that showed its projected path to Washington,
 not its actual radar return.Thus, the Secret Service was relying
 on projections and was not aware the plane was already down
 in Pennsylvania. At some time between 10:10 and 10:15, a military
 aide told the Vice President and others that the aircraft was
 80 miles out. Vice President Cheney was asked for authority
 to engage the aircraft. His reaction was described by Scooter
 Libby as quick and decisive, &ldquo;in about the time it takes
 a batter to decide to swing. &rdquo;The Vice President authorized
 fighter aircraft to engage the inbound plane. He told us he
 based this authorization on his earlier conversa tion with the
 President. The military aide returned a few minutes later, probably
 between 10:12 and 10:18,and said the aircraft was 60 miles out.
 He again asked for authorization to engage. The Vice President
 again said yes. (9/11 report, p. 41)

<p>
 CNN correspondent Chris Plante was in Washington at this time
 and watched a scrambling fighter: All right, the area to the
 west of the Pentagon has been evacuated further back by law
 enforcement and military officials as they anticipate a second
 aircraft arriving at the Pentagon. It has been deemed to be
 threatening enough where I saw at least one F-16 fighter jet
 in the air over the Pentagon, headed to the west, where the
 plane was reportedly coming in from. Again, they are saying
 here a second aircraft is expected to arrive at the Pentagon
 sometime soon. They take it seriously enough that they have
 scrambled at least one fighter jet that I saw, probably either
 from D.C. Air National Guard or the Maryland Air National Guard,
 both of which fly F-16s.CNN 9/11/01

<p>
 The 9/11 report claims that the hijacked plane approaching
 Washington was just a phantom. When Cheney was interviewed by
 Tim Russert five days after the attacks, he didn't admit that
 the crucial "shoot down order" (better: engage order) was meant
 for a phantom flight. Maybe he didn't like to let the people
 know of the grotesque fact that after fighters have been scrambled
 several times in vain to avert real attackers, this time they
 successfully averted a not-existing attacker.

<p>
 But the phantom flight theory leads to very problematic conclusions:
 Cheney based the decision to scramble fighters and engage the
 aircraft on flawed informations from the FAA. The FAA obviously
 didn't observe a moving radar blip since the crash of UA 93.
 The FAA had "lost" the plane, but for some reason assumed that
 it would go straight to Washington, along an ominous "projected
 path". So the FAA was in effect guessing the position of the
 plane, but didn't forward the vagueness of this information
 to the Secret Service. What if the presumed hijackers would
 have decided to deviate from the course to Washington and attack
 Philadephia or New York again? I don't think that after the
 WTC and Pentagon attacks such a behavior of the FAA is sufficiently
 described as incompetence.

<p>
 The report implies also that the FAA was not aware of the crash
 of UA 93 until at least 10:15 and claims that Cleveland Center
 didn't notice the crash: NEADS first received a call about United
 93 from the military liaison at Cleveland Center at 10:07.Unaware
 that the aircraft had already crashed, Cleveland passed to NEADS
 the aircraft&rsquo;s last known latitude and longitude. NEADS
 was never able to locate United 93 on radar because it was already
 in the ground.(9/11 report, p. 30)

<p>
 But Cleveland was well aware of the crash. Cleveland controller
 Stacey Taylor was responsible for UA 93 in its last moments
 and was watching it very carefully. Here's her statement on
 NBC, 9/11/02:

<p>
 BROKAW: You're keeping your eye on Flight 93 at this point?

<p>
 Ms. TAYLOR: Yeah. And then the transponder came back on. We
 got two hits off the transponder. That's something we've always
 wanted to know. Why did the transponder come back on? Because
 the hijackers had shut it off so that they couldn't be tracked,
 even though we were still tracking them. Now we were getting
 an altitude readout on the airplane. I can't remember the precise
 numbers, but it was around 6400 feet, and then around 5900 or
 5800 feet. And we're thinking, 'Oh, you know, maybe something's
 happened, maybe this isn't what we think it is.'

<p>
 BROKAW: (Voiceover) But minutes later, at 10:03, the transponder
 shuts offagain. Flight 93 disappears from radar.

<p>
 (Computer graphic showing flight path for United 93)

<p>
 Ms. TAYLOR: I had another airplane that I was working. And
 I told him, I said, 'Sir,' I said, 'I think we have an aircraft
 down.' I said, 'This is entirely up to you, but if you'd be
 willing to fly over the last place that we spotted this airplane
 that--and see if you can see anything.' And he's like, 'Yeah,
 we'll do that.' So he flew over, and at first he didn't see
 anything. And then he said, 'We see a great big plume or a cloud
 of smoke.'

<p>
 BROKAW: You knew it was down at that point.

<p>
 Ms. TAYLOR: We knew.

<p>
 So when UA 93 disappeared from radar, Ms. Taylor immediately
 suspected the airplane was down and asked a nearby pilot for
 help. The pilot confirmed her conjecture. Why did the FAA forward
 a "projected path" of an confirmed downed airplane to the Secret
 Service? And how does the FAA explain the contradiction between
 Ms. Taylor's statement and the claim that Cleveland Center was
 unaware of the crash?

<p>
 The assumption that the Fifth Plane was just a phantom and
 mixed up with UA 93 leads inevitably to serious contradictions.
 We should drop it and instead postulate a real airplane en route
 to Washington, creating a real radar signal which outlasted
 the UA 93 crash.

<h>Is Flight X the Fifth Plane?

<p>
 The final fate of the Fifth Plane lies in the dark. The media
 stopped the coverage soon and dropped the subject like a hot
 potato. Contradicting rumours that it crashed (conveyed by CBS)
 or was forced down near Camp David turned out to be wrong. They
 were probably based on the fuzzy official statement that the
 airplane was "no longer a threat". It's quite sure that it was
 intercepted by fighters, but we don't know its way afterwards.
 Because we also don't know where Flight X came from, it's tempting
 to assume that the two planes are identical, but the proof is
 still missing.

<p>
 After all, in the huge history encyclopedia called the Internet
 we find this message:

<p>I'm sure there was a fifth plane involved that was headed toward
 Camp David; however, that plane was forced (yes forced, militarily)
 to land in Cleveland. I thought the target could also have be
 NASA's Glen/Lewis Research Center that is right next to the
 Cleveland Airport. The news reported that the plane landed because
 of a suspected bomb on board but they haven't released anyone
 that was on that plane. The closed NASA and transported everyone
 that was on the plane there for questioning. They are going
 through the plane and luggage with a fine toothed comb. The
 original flight plan was from Boston to LA.They closed all exits
 from the freeway to get into the airport and even bus drivers
 were told that if they attempted to exit, they would be shot.
 People that were already at the airport were forced to walk
 for miles to get transportation home because they were not even
 allowed to remove their cars from the parking lots.Source

<p>
 This message is the missing link between the Fifth Plane and
 Flight X. Admittedly, the author is an unknown individual with
 nickname "Connie" and no star reporter from the Washington Post.
 Nevertheless, it appears that "Connie" was at or near Cleveland
 Airport on 9/11. The report sounds credible and corroborates
 the thesis that Flight X and the Fifth Plane are identical.

<h>The Radio Hijacker Plane

<p>
 Here is an excerpt from the recording (and here you can listen
 to it):

<p>
 Cleveland: United ninety-three, check in when flight level
 three-five-zero &ndash; [unintelligible].

<p>
 United 93: United ninety-three check in three-five-zero.

<p>
 Cleveland: United ninety-three, three-five-zero, Roger. United
 ninety-three, you have traffic to your one o&rsquo;clock, twelve
 miles eastbound three-seven-zero.

<p>
 United 93: Negative contact, we&rsquo;re looking United ninety-three.

<p>
 Cleveland: Somebody call Cleveland? [No noise on this Cleveland
 tape, must be a different frequency being monitored by Cleveland
 on another tape.] United ninety-three verify three-five-zero,
 United ninety-three verify your flight level, er, three-five-zero.
 United ninety-three verify your flight level is three-five-zero.
 United ninety-three Cleveland, United ninety-three Cleveland.
 United ninety-three do you read Cleveland Center please?

<p>
 United 797: United fifteen twenty-three, did you hear the company,
 er, did you hear some other aircraft on a frequency a couple
 of minutes ago, screaming?

<p>
 United 1523: Yes I did, seven ninety-seven, and, ah, we couldn&rsquo;t
 tell what it was either.

<p>
 United 797: OK.

<p>
 Cleveland: United ninety-three Cleveland, if you hear the center,
 ident [command for United 93 to send secondary radar transponder
 positive identification]

<p>
 American 1060: American ten-sixty, er, ditto also on the other
 transmission.

<p>
 Cleveland: American ten-sixty, you heard that also?

<p>
 American 1060: We heard it twice.

<p>
 Cleveland: Roger, we heard that also. [No noise on Cleveland
 tape.] Thanks. We just wanted to confirm that wasn&rsquo;t some
 interference.

<p>
 Executive 956: Executive nine fifty-six.

<p>
 Cleveland: Executive nine fifty-six, go.

<p>
 Executive 956: Just answering your call. We could year that,
 er, yelling too.

<p>
 Cleveland: OK, thank you, we&rsquo;re just trying to figure
 out what&rsquo;s going on.

<p>
 United 93: [unintelligible] this is captain, please sit down,
 remain sitting, we have a bomb on board. [Signal strength 5,
 readability 1.]

<p>
 Executive 956: [unintelligible] sounded like he said he had
 a bomb on board.

<p>
 Cleveland: Uh, say again, you there, United ninety-three? (Translation
 and Comments: Joe Vialls)

<p>
 Joe Vialls has analysed the recording and gives two reasons
 why the distorted radio messages didn't come from UA 93:

<p>
 1) When UA 93 checks in to Cleveland ARTCC Airspace (in the
 beginning of the tape), its message is clear and understandable
 (Signal strength 5, readability 5). But later, the hijacker's
 voice is distorted by heavy background noise (Signal strength
 5, readability 1). This means that the two messages have different
 origins, i.e. they came from different locations.

<p>
 2) Air controllers have the technical means to determine the
 direction where a radio signal comes from (per RDF, Radio Direction
 Finding). Vialls: "Though the Cleveland controller appears to
 infer that two distorted radio calls about a 'bomb' originate
 from United Flight 93, this is not actually the case. By repeatedly
 calling Flight 93, the controller is actually trying to determine
 whether or not the calls originated from that aircraft....Nor
 are there any proper RDF logs available to prove the point of
 origin of the wholly independent 'bomb' claims, which could
 easily have been transmitted from another unidentifeid aircraft,
 or from the ground."

<p>
 Vialls concludes that the "bomb" messages are faked, but he
 doesn't seem to know that the air controllers had already determined
 their origin: it was Delta 1989!

<p>Now around 9:30 a.m., controllers hear words that seem to confirm
 their worst fears. They hear shouting as Flight 1989 approaches
 the Ohio border. Then they hear a voice: "Get out of there!"
 Then what sounds like a scuffle. Minutes later, a new voice,
 this one with a heavy accent: "Ladies and gentlemen, here it's
 the captain. Please sit down. Keep remaining sitting. We have
 a bomb aboard." No one who hears those words believes they are
 coming from Werner (pilot of Delta 1989). Not with such a heavy
 accent. No way. Rather, the transmission seems to be from a
 hijacker who unwittingly spoke over the radio when he meant
 to address passengers.USA Today, 8/12/02

<p>During tense moments that morning at Cleveland Air Route Traffic
 Control Center, the first guess was that Delta Flight 1989 was
 hijacked, not United Airlines Flight 93. "We knew right away
 we had a problem. The first thought was, 'Is that Delta 1989?'"
 said Rick Kettell, manager of the Federal Aviation Administration's
 busiest regional center.CNN, 8/9/02

<p>The center's controllers were concerned about the Delta flight
 because it had departed Boston five minutes behind United Flight
 175, which crashed into the south tower of the World Trade Center
 in New York.We knew the magnitude of what we were dealing with,"
 Kettell said. "We knew what happened in New York before our
 involvement became very keen." Shortly after Delta Flight 1989
 checked in with the Cleveland Center while over Syracuse, N.Y.,
 the center's controllers heard two transmissions that sounded
 like a cockpit struggle.ABC News, 8/14/02

<p>
 So the screams and the first hijacker messages were apparently
 coming from Delta 1989's position. The airplane was at that
 time 25 miles away from UA 93. But there were no screaming people
 aboard Delta 1989, no bomb, no hijackers. How do we solve this
 contradiction?

<p>
 The most logical solution is: there was an airplane flying
 parallel to Delta 1989, probably some thousand feet higher or
 lower. The transponder was turned off, and its radar blip was
 not visible to the controllers because it was "covered" by the
 Delta 1989 blip. It was flying in the "radar shadow" of Delta
 1989. This airplane was the origin of the famous radio messages
 and likely hijacked. This on the first view daring explanation
 will turn out to be perfectly consistent with the reports of
 the Fifth Plane.

<p>
 There is another reason why UA 93 was probably not the Radio
 Hijacker Plane: the radio hijacker ordered the passengers two
 times to remain sitting, the last time at 9:39 (9/11 report,
 p.12). But at this moment the passengers of UA 93 had been forced
 to the rear already. Jeremy Glick called his wife at 9:37 on
 an airphone and told her that he had left his seat in row 11.
 Tom Burnett called his wife at 9:34 on an airphone, too (Jere
 Longman, Among the Heroes). But according to the 9/11 report,
 all airphone calls have been made from the rear of UA 93 (9/11
 report, p. 456, footnote No. 77). This discrepancy is best solved
 by assuming that we are dealing with two different airplanes.

<h>Is Flight X the Radio Hijacker Plane?

<p>
 The mayor of Cleveland, Michael White, said in his first news
 conference on September 11 that air controllers reported screams
 coming from Flight X, and that a bomb was on board. He admitted
 indirectly that there were unconfirmed reports that it was hijacked.
 Cleveland air controllers (likely the same ones) have heard
 screams, too, they knew about a bomb threat and suspected a
 hijacking. The similarities are striking. White's source was
 most likely refering to the same radio calls that are discussed
 here. We don't know where the Radio Hijacker Plane went after
 the radio transmissions, and we don't know where Flight X came
 from. The thesis that Flight X is identical with the Radio Hijacker
 Plane is, while not proven, very appealing.

<h>The Flight X Timeline and Path

<p>
 The thesis Flight X = the Fifth Plane = the Radio Hijacker
 Plane has yet to pass a test where time and location data are
 cross-checked with each other. If it's possible to compose a
 timeline and a flight path matching all three flights without
 contradictions, the thesis gets a big kick. If contradictions
 emerge, we have to drop it.

<p>
 Evaluating the sources for the Radio Hijacker Plane (RHP) and
 the Fifth Plane (FP) yields this time table:

<p>
 Time.......................Approximate Location.................Source................Event....................................

<p>
 9:28...................25 miles NE of Youngstown/Ohio.........(1)..........Screams
 from Flight X (RHP)

<p>
 9:31...................Youngstown/Ohio ................................(1)..........First
 hijacker radio message from Flight X (RHP)

<p>
 9:39...................Cleveland/Oberlin................................
 (1)..........Last hijacker radio message from Flight X (RHP)

<p>
 10:10.................80 miles NW of Washington.................(2)..........Flight
 X (FP) is heading Washington

<p>
 10:18.................50 miles NW of Washington.................(2)..........Flight
 X (FP) is intercepted by fighters

<p>
 10:45.................Cleveland Airport.................................(3)..........Flight
 X is forced to land

<p>
 (1) This is based on the assumption that the RHP was first
 flying in the radar shadow of Delta 1989, i.e., it flew along
 the same path. USA Today relates details of the Delta 1989 path.
 And when UA 93 made his turn at 9:36, Delta 1989 was told to
 stay away from it. It was just 15 miles away at this moment.

<p>
 The table indicates that Flight X made two sharp turns: the
 first one over Ohio, just like UA 93, and the second one 50
 miles west or northwest of Washington - near Camp David - when
 he was intercepted by fighters and forced to move off the capital.
 We know the time and approximate location of the second turning
 point from the 9/11 report. Considering the airplane's speed
 as well as the geographical distances and bearing in mind that
 it entered Ohio airspace together with Delta 1989, we can roughly
 estimate the time of the first turning point: 9:38. This yields
 the following flight path:

<p>
 There are no data available for the gap between the Radio Hijacker
 Plane and the Fifth Plane (or between 9:39 and 10:10, in chronological
 terms). However, a "lost plane" was reported over Ohio by local
 broadcast stations: "There was still a missing plane that had
 been in the area earlier." Cheney received reports in his shelter
 that there was an aircraft downed in Ohio. And an air controller
 from Cleveland Center, writing under pseudonym, has heard from
 a "lost" airplane, too, but we have to classify this information
 as hearsay, because he was not in Oberlin on September 11. So
 the evidence for a "lost plane" is fuzzy, but it's a nice designation
 for the gap.

<p>
 If we put together the paths of Flight X, UA 93 and Delta 1989,
 we get an interesting picture:

<p>
 The paths of this sketch are just approximate, of course, and
 rely in part strongly on estimations. Nevertheless, we know
 that Flight X was headed for Washington just like UA 93, and
 at the same time. So if we accept that Flight X was hiding behind
 Delta 1989 when entering Ohio airspace, we should also consider
 the possibility that Flight X was hiding behind UA 93 after
 the turn. The airplane changed its cover. This scenario would
 explain the "lost plane" reports: when Flight X left the Delta
 1989 cover at about 9:38 and turned around, his radar blip was
 visible for a short time before he reached the new cover UA
 93. Then the blip vanished, and the "lost plane" was born. Some
 controllers misinterpreted the missing blip as a crash, and
 the rumour of a plane "downed in Ohio" was born. This scenario
 explains also why UA 93 climbed on 41700 feet when he turned
 around: he wanted to clear the way for Flight X. The two hijackings
 were obviously coordinated.

<h>Summary

<p>
 The thesis of the secret hijacked airplane helps to explain
 many hitherto unsolved peculiarities of 9/11. It looks like
 the existence of this flight was meant to be hidden from the
 public by interested circles, so the question arises: Why was
 it kept secret?

<p>
 And of course it would be interesting to find out the airport
 where Flight X started.

<p>You seem to have overlooked a more interesting possibility. Are
 you aware that Flight 77 actually turned off it's transponder
 and vanished from radar in OHIO??? Whatever Unidentified Radar
 Blips (URB's) were later detected headed toward Washington DC
 actually were not identified by air traffic controllers as Flight
 77 or any other 757. Indeed, the maneuvers of the officially
 supposed "Flight 77" URB made ground controllers think it was
 a military plane! So what would really make more sense is one
 of these "mystery landings" was Flight 77!

<p>clearly the maps we were shown were pure BS.
 If you look at
 the maps it shows flight 93 at 35,000ft at 450mph on the last
 blip.
 the witness accounts are much different.

<p>
 According to the maps, the destination ariport changes to DCA
 and the ETA changes twice.
 It was said 93 filed a new flight
 plan, but the chages i state above are shown on the map 1/2
 hour after it was hijacked. i dont know how the maps are updated,
 but "flight explorer" the company that made them , gets its
 info from the FAA.

<p>
 also the last blip for flight 11 when it hit the tower is at
 29,000ft, the last blip for flight 175 is at 31,000ft.

<p>
 also noteworthy is in the 911-commission report, they say that
 flight 175 CHANGED its transponder code twice?
 Why would hijacker
 do that? all that would do is throw up red flags to the controllers?

 93 suposedly also changed its TXcode?

<p>
 Were the codes really changed? or did the FAA/controllers start
 picking up a different plane?
 I think this could be a crucial
 point to find out what happened, the oddities on the maps.

<p>
 now, back to flight 77, i heard this on audio...

<p>
 (from audio of Howard Stern on the day of 9/11)http://faultgame.com/images/stern/09-11-01WTC-24.mp3

 (43 megs)( this was reported after the 93 crashed)

<p>
 a 767 from pittsburg was hijcked approaching Northern virginia,

 circling an airport in virginia. Fox reporting a second plane
 heading toward the pentagon

<p>
 How does this fit in?
 ---

<p>
 now, some info on the FAA...

<p>
 PTECH, founded by a Saudi financier placed on America&rsquo;s
 Terrorist Watch List in October 2001, had access to the FAA&rsquo;s
 entire computer system for two years before the 9/11 attack

<p>
 and...
 The Nimda worm has affected companies and organizations
 throughout the country, as you have probably heard or read in
 the news. The FAA's internal network is also affected. Until
 the worm is eradicated, internal FAA users will be unable to
 view external web pages directly

<p>
 So the FAA couldnt log in on 911, and a Saudi comapny (some
 say CIA linked) had access !
