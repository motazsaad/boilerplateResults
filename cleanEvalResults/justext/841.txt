<p>Here is a book on parapsycology that we wish to publish on the
 Internet. Our thesis is that "the more learning disabed a person
 is, assuming normal or above intelligence, the more likely they
 are to have psychic abilities." There is a self-test for Creative
 Thinking and 61 stratagies for coping with learning differences.
 This information is useful to everyone. From: Paul Murray at

 71 PREFACE In addition to the sources referenced in Appendix
 A, the ideas in this book are based on the authors' personal
 experiences with learning differences: characterized as dyslexia
 and the related syndrome of attention inconsistency, thinking
 visually, and seeking stimulation, that is commonly refereed
 to as Attention Deficit Deficiency (ADD). Paul Murray, spent
 many years living with the handicaps described above. It took
 hard work, persistence, some fortunate luck, and use of many
 of the techniques explained here, to reach the highest levels
 of success in academics, sports, and business. The co-author,
 Daniele Murray, is a student who is learning to live with her
 learning differences and to unlock her unique mental abilities
 of Creative Thinking. This information on learning differences
 and the abilities of Creative Thinking that many people have
 is being provided so that others who have similar feelings and
 capabilities can be successful with less effort and in a relatively
 shorter time. As with all ideas, the "idea" in this book can
 not be copyrighted. We want the ideas to spread. Modify them,
 adapt them, tell others, test the questionnaire, and invent
 new strategies. The only thing that's copyrighted is the wording
 of this text. Permission is hereby granted for you to reproduce
 this text, or excerpts, for public benefit (e.g. in a non-profit
 newsletters); but not for commercial uses. It is our express
 intention to publish this text commercially. If you do print
 articles that discuss these views, we would love it if you can
 send us a copy. We would like to follow the ideas and discussions.

 P.O. Box 2009, Osterville, MA 02655; INTRODUCTION The theme
 of this book is that, "Everyone is different; but that each
 person has some of both the positive and the negative attributes
 of learning differences. There are a multitude of attributes
 and each person falls some where on a continuum of ability for
 each trait. Everyone has some of the attributes of Creative
 Thinking and can benefit from the ideas presented here. To determine
 an approximation of your personal degree of Creative Thinking,
 please take a few moments now to take one of the "Self-Tests
 For Creative Thinking" in Appendix B or C. Appendix B is for
 students and Appendix C is for adults. One of the intentions
 of this book is to reach those individuals needing remedial
 educational training because of learning differences. Hopefully
 the information provided here will motivate them to take control
 of their future. We hope to place them in a frame of mind to
 acknowledge their situation and also to see "a light at the
 end of the tunnel." Once these individuals can overcome their
 educational problems and learn to cope with the complexities
 of learning differences, they can look forward to the possibility
 of using some of their genius abilities of Creative Thinking
 that are available to them as a result of their unique thinking
 processes. A second objective of this book is to replace the
 negative sigma, that unfortunately frequently accompanies learning
 differences like: dyslexia and ADD, with the positive attributes
 of unique mental abilities, that we call Creative Thinking.
 These strengths come from the visual mental processing that
 enables many Creative Thinkers to discern patterns into the
 future, communicate on a higher level, and understand complexities
 that baffle others. The third objective of this book is to help
 identify those individuals having a high degree of Creative
 Thinking. Only rarely does a person with learning differences
 get to make use of his Creative Thinking abilities. Too many
 people fail to reach their potential. The future rests in the
 hands of those who can think creatively and accomplish what
 no one can even envision in today's environment. People with
 learning differences frequently have gifts of mental abilities
 that they and others can not even comprehend. In yesterday's
 environment conformity was required; but for tomorrow's the
 ability to think creatively, beyond anyone's current imagination,
 will be necessary to be competitive. This book is not intended
 to provide remedial training of educational deficiencies, such
 as: reading, spelling, handwriting, comprehension, etc. This
 educational achievement can only be accomplished in a school
 or tutoring setting with patience, structure, considerable time,
 review of the basics of language, and a multi-dimensional educational
 approach using the senses of hearing, seeing, touching, and
 feeling. This book is not intended as a substitute for proper
 medical advice. The ideas in this book are based on the authors'
 personal experiences with learning differences; and as such
 these ideas are not to be considered medical advise. Readers
 should seek competent medical advice from qualified health care
 practitioners for any symptoms that may require diagnosis or
 medical treatment, and before taking any medication, including
 over the counter medicine. There are some interesting and reportedly
 successful medical and common sense treatments that seem to
 be helping many people with learning differences. * These treatments
 include stimulants: like Ritlin or caffeine, antihistamine medicines
 that treat inner ear problems: like Sudafed or Dimetapp, anti-motion
 treatments: like Dramamine or Bonine, and coping skills to deal
 with confusion and disorientation. Following a well-balanced
 diet, eating breakfast, taking vitamins and minerals supplements,
 and getting 30 minutes of vigorous exercise daily is good common
 sense that will help everyone. Both authors have been following
 the medical advise of Dr. Levinson, regarding inner ear medicine,
 with significant success. * Please refer to Dr. Harold Levinson's
 book, Smart But Feeling Dumb, Mr. Ronald Davis' book, The Gift
 of Dyslexia, as well as other sources in Appendix B. CREATIVE
 THINKING Creative Thinkers can frequently see into the future
 by identifying and projecting patterns and other forms. With
 the use of unique visual mental processes they are able to predict
 outcomes and visualize results that others can not comprehend.
 Creative Thinkers can also sometimes change time perspectives
 and view events as they unfold in slow motion. This can enables
 them to react favorably especially in sports. These abilities
 seem to be most pronounced in people that we frequently consider
 to be handicapped or even stupid. Creative Thinking is the positive
 side of those people who have learning differences like dyslexia
 and Attention Deficit Disorder. Some of the common traits associated
 with learning differences of dyslexia and ADD are listed for
 reference in Appendix C. Creative Thinkers unique mental processing
 style of three-dimensional visualization, of abstract as well
 as material things, can create some interesting and profitable
 observations. Creative Thinkers often find it easy to move from
 one field to another; because they can master new subjects quickly
 and become instant experts. They can see the big picture, not
 get lost in details, and get to the heart of the matter. Creative
 Thinkers see patterns, connections, and similarities that enable
 them to see clearly into the future by projection. LEARNING
 DIFFERENCES- A LIFE OF CONFUSION AND EMBARRASSMENT, WITH GENIUS
 ABILITIES: Disabilities can be physical or mental. Our society
 provides special considerations and compassion for people who
 are physically disabled, especially those who are visually obvious,
 such as those using a cane or a wheelchair. Mental disabilities,
 like the learning differences of dyslexia and ADD, are hidden.
 The students with specific learning disabilities are protected
 by a federal law, The Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA),
 and various state laws. The federal law, IDEA, assures that
 all children with disabilities are provided a free, appropriate
 public education designed to meet their unique needs. Dyslexia
 is a learning difference of language and communication that
 can result in lapses of memory, difficulties in learning to
 read and communicate, or the lack of understanding of social
 situations. The characteristics of the learning difference Attention
 Deficit Disorder (ADD), without hyperactivity, include: being
 aware of everything around them, easily distracted, seeking
 stimulation, having difficulty with auditory processing, and
 thinking visually. People with these learning differences are
 unique because they learn, think, and respond differently to
 the world around them. They frequently are very Creative Thinkers
 because of their unique mental processing. Those of us who have
 learning differences do not want to expose the inability to
 function sometimes as quickly or with the same memory functions
 as others, because of embarrassment. Frequently others will
 laugh at simple mistakes, such as: not knowing the day of the
 week, a close relative's name, how to remember and dial a telephone
 number, or the location of a letter in the alphabet. These examples
 may explain why people with learning differences have a sense
 of inferiority and tend to withdraw from social contact. The
 sense of frustration, ridicule, and embarrassment can be overwhelming.
 Many times these handicaps can be overcome by training, medicine,
 and instruction; but most difficulties are with us for life.
 Those traits that we can not change are sometimes better not
 disclosed and can be disguised with some simple deception. Using
 deception is okay for self protection. Do not give anyone the
 opportunity to laugh at you, ridicule, or humiliate you in any
 way. Athletes, like Greg Lemond the former World champion cyclist,
 use deception to hide their real feelings of hurting, physically
 and mentally. Greg told me, "Never let your competitors see
 you hurting. Put on an act to deceive them, otherwise they will
 attack you when they think that you are the weakest." Arnold
 Schwarzenegger's advice, in posing in a body building contest,
 was, "Never let the judges see your weaknesses. Show your strengths
 and hide any problems. Be self-confident about your abilities
 and they will show." Dale Carnegie, the famous personal relations
 and public speaking coach, said, "Assume a trait like self-confidence
 and soon you will be use to it and it will come naturally to
 you." Spies need deception to protect their real identity, their
 objectives, and frequently their life. Make use of the suggestions
 that follow and others that you invent to present yourself in
 a way that, "you can anticipate and control situations." STRENGTHS
 OF CREATIVE THINKERS Many people with learning differences are
 capable of some extraordinary thinking and can be extremely
 successful once they learn some coping strategies. Some of Creative
 Thinker's strengths are: Persistence, Concentration, Perception,
 Vivid imagination, Creativity, Drive and ambition, Curiosity,
 Thinking in pictures instead of words, Superior reasoning, Capable
 of seeing things differently from others, Love of complexity,
 Simultaneous multiple thought processing, Quickly mastering
 new concepts, and Not following the Crowd. Most people who are
 not dyslexic and rate low on the scale of Creative Thinking,
 are verbal learners, based on word acquisition by hearing. Verbal
 learning is limited to the speed of speaking and this information
 goes into the conscious mind, so that the non-dyslexic is aware
 of the information. Thinking and learning in pictures rather
 than words is thousands of time faster, and is subliminal, going
 directly into the subconscious mind. This visual learning style
 is what a Creative Thinker uses. The acquisition of information
 as pictures create an immense amount of multi-dimensional information,
 that can be manipulated in many forms by the brain to enable
 intuitive thinking, perception, and other interesting thought
 processes. Frequently this learning style leads to thought delays,
 because of the tremendous amounts of information processed.
 This rapid acquisition of picture form knowledge gives the Creative
 Thinker a significant advantage; but confusion and disorientation
 can arise with words and thoughts that do not have pictures,
 like sight words. Non-visual sight words must be learned and
 experienced multi-dimensionally for dyslexics to learn to read.
 Fortunately there are only a few hundred simple words to learn.
 UNUSUAL ABILITIES OF SOME CREATIVE THINKERS Although each Creative
 Thinker is distinctively different in their mental capabilities,
 some of these abilities can be evidence of the intellectual
 and creative powers of a genius waiting to be unlocked. Imagine
 feeling that someone is behind you before you can see or hear
 them. Some Creative Thinkers have mental abilities that go well
 beyond this common phenomena and approach the supernatural.
 Examples include: Doing complex math in their head quickly;
 but not knowing how they did it, Seeing a solution from a mental
 examination of the components, such as projecting interest rates
 for investments, or creating a new computer chip, Communicating
 telepathically with others, or Controlling the outcome of events,
 like calling the correct numbers on dice before they are rolled.
 Although not all Creative Thinkers possess these talents, extrasensory
 perceptions like these represent abilities that are uniquely
 valuable to some; but ludicrous to others who do not understand
 the learning and mental processing differences of Creative Thinking.
 The authors intend to continue with research about some of the
 phenomena described above as super natural gifts. Readers are
 invited to provide their personal experiences. If you have any
 of these special gifts please tell us along with your test scores.
 Appendix D describes a few psychic experiences. Creative Thinkers
 have some unique gifts that enable them to succeed in areas
 of great difficulty for other people. In spite of the frustrations
 of mental lapses that people with learning differences frequently
 experience, they do have a number of mental abilities that are
 unique and valuable. Some of the natural advantages of being
 a Creative Thinker are described here as challenges to make
 use of their distinct talents. SOME GIFTS OF CREATIVE THINKING:
 . USE YOUR SUPERIOR REASONING AND CONCENTRATION SKILLS: The
 ability to see things that others fail to recognize, such as:
 patterns of activities that lead to predicting future events
 and understanding of complex issues can compensate for short
 term handicaps. Give thought before answering or preparing written
 material. Look for meaning, especially ones that others will
 not see, until you identify them. Use your powers of total concentration;
 and share your ability to visualize and see ahead. . USE YOUR
 CREATIVITY, CURIOSITY, AND IMAGINATION: Creative Thinkers are
 naturally very inventive and can use this trait to be successful.
 Be curious. Do something new. Break the mold of conformity.
 Invent exciting situations. Use your curiosity and imagination
 to explore and learn. Make use of your ability to notice everything
 happening around you. . UTILIZE RAPID MASTERY AND PERCEPTION
 TALENTS: Many Creative Thinkers can learn new concepts and master
 new subjects quickly because of their visual learning style
 and their ability to see problems and situations from many angles.
 Be comfortable making rapid decisions. Be results orientated.
 . MAKE USE OF THE ABILITY TO PROCESS MANY THOUGHTS SIMULTANEOUSLY
 AND HAVE A HIGH TOLERANCE FOR AMBIGUITY: The ability to watch
 and comprehend a number of television channels at the same time,
 while reading, and listening to music is a unique ability to
 think and perceive on multiple levels. Ambiguity is the ability
 to be comfortable with uncertainty. Seek to have many different
 activities going on at the same time. . BE COMFORTABLE BEING
 DIFFERENT: Most people in our society are conformists, who "follow
 the crowd." Creative Thinkers frequently go in a different direction
 than others because they see the world around them in a unique
 visual way. The ability to see solutions that are different
 from the norm can result in exciting employment opportunities,
 for example in investments, computer programming, and national
 security areas. Creating unique interesting situations can result
 in personal leadership and profitable opportunities. . CONTROL
 DRIVE AND AMBITION: Try to achieve a degree of reasonableness
 in the challenges that you undertake. Many Creative Thinkers
 are impulsively driven to accomplish more and more without limits,
 and can become overachievers. Set reasonable goals in a stair-like
 format to create winning situations. Control your impulse to
 seek huge wins and a sometimes exaggerated sense of urgency
 and impatience. Build on success. USEFUL TEACHING CONCEPTS Teachers
 and others trying to help people with learning disabilities
 can provide motivation and support by: Empowering the student
 to make a contribution that is within their ability and is useful,
 Provide choices to enable the student to feel in control, Conducting
 early testing for learning differences to obtain early intervention
 and avoid the ridicule and embarrassment that most students
 with learning differences feel, Provide opportunities for the
 student to teach others about something that they know, Use
 visual and hands on, tactile, learning experiences and reduce
 the use of lectures and books, Use computers as private tutors
 to teach at the student's level for remedial work, Use line
 dancing and other group movements like hand signs, to practice
 rhythm, balance, and coordination, Giving specific praise to
 make them feel special, and Be that adult that that believes
 in them and is there for support. Establish peer tutors so that
 students have role models and people they can speak frankly
 with, Use touching, hugs, etc, as a warm positive experience
 that builds self-esteem and confidence. Help students develop
 a system for systematically solving problems including: defining
 the problem, establishment of criteria, discussing alternatives,
 and coming to a logical conclusion. Provide time structure for
 students and break up assignments into manageable pieces, and
 Use games to teach reasonable risk taking. 61 EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES
 FOR CREATIVE THINKERS: Students and adults with learning differences,
 of dyslexia and ADD need some "personal magic" to deal with
 other people to avoid embarrassment and gain respect. Many Creative
 Thinkers frequently feel left out of relationships and social
 situations. They suffer from frustration and embarrassment,
 because they can not do some of the things that others consider
 simple. Creative Thinkers, and others, should consider the following
 strategies of social and technical skills that represent common
 sense compensations, are relatively easy to implement, and are
 free of charge. SOCIAL SKILLS: 1. BE SELF-CONFIDENT: Look, feel,
 and act in control; knowledgeable and ready to meet any challenge.
 Volunteer, raise your hand and try. You will be successful sometimes
 and learn more from failures than any other way. Meet new people,
 make small talk, say hello to strangers, ask questions, participate.
 2. ANTICIPATE SITUATIONS: Be ready to react to problems by using
 your reasoning skills to think ahead to possible outcomes and
 allow your mind to prepare solutions in advance. 3. LEARN TO
 DEAL WITH FAILURE: Everybody experiences failure. The intelligent
 people learn, by analyzing the situation, to try to turn the
 experience into a profit. Review tests to completely understand
 all questions and redraft all papers returned with corrections.
 Try to learn from each mistake, criticisms, etc. Attack problems
 from many angles, so that if one fails, alternatives are ready.
 Analyze and ask others what went wrong in relations, situations,
 etc. Learn what you might do differently. 4. BE PERSISTENT:
 Never let others influence you to quit. Do not give up. Go on
 longer than anyone expects you to and you will probably see
 results that will surprise you because Creative Thinkers have
 unique abilities. Don't be discouraged by set backs. If your
 answer is not correct, ask why not and try again. Use your self-confidence
 to try many times with different approaches each time. 5. SEEK
 OUT WAYS TO BE SUCCESSFUL: Look in any area for success such
 as: sports, social, school, home, community, etc. Look for ways
 to achieve positive results to keep up your spirits and motivation.
 When you think that you know an answer, be sure to volunteer.
 Look for small winning situations. 6. THINK BEFORE YOU SPEAK:
 Consider the possible reaction that other people may have to
 what you are about to say. Avoid impulsive statements that you
 may later regret, wish to take back, or want to apologize for.
 7. ASK FOR HELP: Raise questions in your mind. Be sure that
 you understand, and can repeat in your words, the ideas being
 covered. If not, say that you do not understand and ask for
 explanations or help. Ask people to define words that are new
 to you. Ask a classmate or other friends to help explain directions,
 homework, etc.; so that you understand what and when you have
 to do something. Using a peer as a tutor can help. 8. AVOID
 HIGH PROBABILITY FAILURE EXPERIENCES: Do not set unrealistically
 high goals. Examine your probability of success before committing
 to play or participate. Get the odds in your favor. Set realistic
 goals. Look for small wins. 9. ASK PEERS HOW THEY DEAL WITH
 THE PROBLEMS THAT YOU FACE: Don't be afraid to show your feelings
 and discuss your concerns with sympathetic friends. Open up
 to sympathetic associates. Ask others how they would deal with
 problems that you face. 10. TRY NOT TO BE A LONER: Social interaction
 is necessary and helpful to meet your needs of acceptance, as
 a source of information, and personal realizations. Be involved.
 Find a friend to help you with introductions, introduce yourself,
 or ask a question of someone new. 11. FORCE YOURSELF TO SAY
 HELLO EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T REMEMBER NAMES: Creative Thinkers
 frequently are shy and avoid social contacts. They walk around
 with blinders on because they are fearful of meeting someone
 that they know very well, and realize that the person's name
 will not come to them. It's very important to say hello and
 be friendly. The name will usually come to you. If the name
 does not come to you, ask "Excuse me, I have a poor memory,
 I forgot your name." Keep your head up and say hello. Do not
 duck people just because you may not know their name. Use the
 third person, you, in conversation. Being friendly is more important
 than remembering a name. Your real friends will most likely
 know about your memory difficulties and have compassion. 12.
 LEARN HOW TO MAKE SMALL TALK: Small talk is the sometimes meaningless
 or simple discussions that we have with friends or new acquaintances
 about the weather and other non-serious topics. Small talk makes
 people comfortable before moving into serious topics, is useful
 to get to know someone or to pass the time of day. Talk about
 common interests or ask simple questions. 13. LEARN TO READ
 SOCIAL CLUES: Study people, looking for reactions to your physical
 movements and verbal statements. Learn from each of your experiences.
 14. DEVELOP A COMFORTABLE FEELING: Learn to accept and live
 with the feeling of uncomfortableness that sometimes comes to
 you from: confusion, being different, or not knowing an answer.
 Learn to pause and endure moments of silence while you gather
 your thoughts. 15. CONTROL YOUR EMOTIONAL RESPONSES: Use deep
 breathing, and look at the big picture. How important is this
 anyway? What will I remember about this in six months? Do not
 let others or situation upset you. Stay in control. 16. SEEK
 COMPLEXITY: Look for multiple problems or activities to be going
 on simultaneously. This what you thrive on. Maintain your options.
 Complexity also includes tackling difficult problems that others
 shy away from because of the difficulty of resolving them. 17.
 FIND A MENTOR (A ROLE MODEL) AND COPY THEIR ACTIONS, WORDING,
 ETC.: Learn by observing others that you admire. How do they
 do things or respond to situations? A good boss may be the best
 person to learn from. Observe others that you consider successful.
 How do they do it? Ask them. 18. ADMIT YOUR PROCESSING DIFFICULTIES:
 Carefully explain your memory dilemma and other needs to sympathetic
 listeners, teachers, and in conflicts of misunderstanding. Ask
 to take tests orally if you do not write well or fast, or alternately
 ask to submit extra papers if you do not feel comfortable thinking
 and speaking on your feet. Your difficulties may not show. Let
 people know that you have difficulties so that they can help
 you. Tell your real friends about your needs for more time to
 think and that you do not always have a good memory so that
 they can adjust to you. 19. USE SPORTS TO BE INCLUDED: Develop
 your abilities in sports by practicing and getting coaching
 so that you can do well enough; and you will be included socially
 as well as on the field. 20. USE COMEDY AND LAUGHTER TO RELIEVE
 STRESS: Learning difficulties create immense stresses that block
 learning and create social difficulties. Finding opportunities
 to laugh and enjoy yourself is useful as a diversion and eliminator
 of stress. Hang out with some people who find humor in everyday
 events. Avoid negative and excessively serious people. 21. SEEK
 OUT OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPERIENCE HUMAN TOUCHING: Shake hands,
 give hugs, and associate with people who give you hugs. Touching
 is acceptance, a warm positive experience, and builds self-esteem
 and confidence. Consider the French tradition of shaking everyone's
 hand on arrival and before leaving a meeting or job. Shake hands
 and establish eye contact to build trust. Hug female friends.
 Females hug your friends and students. 22. TRY NOT TO BE SELF-CONSCIOUS:
 Others will relate to you regarding the way that you present
 yourself. Be energetic, friendly, communicative and try to have
 a positive attitude. Assume the trait of self-confidence. Do
 not be so concerned about what others might think about you.
 Be yourself. 23. SPEAK UP FOR YOURSELF OR WRITE A NOTE: Anything
 that you feel is unfair, unclear, or unnecessary must be confronted
 right away. Complain. No matter how you do it, do it immediately.
 It's easier and you will be more emotionally involved. 24. USE
 YOUR INTUITIVE POWERS: Many Creative Thinkers have special abilities
 to anticipate, decipher meanings, and to influence outcomes.
 Practice these unique traits. 25. TALK AT YOUR SPEED: Use a
 comfortable speed for talking. Do not feel rushed, and stop
 anyone who tries to complete your sentence or thoughts, by raising
 your hand with the palm facing them. Stay in control of your
 ideas. Speak only as the words or thoughts come to you. People
 will understand you better. 26. LEARN GOOD EYE CONTACT: Keep
 your head and eyes up and look people in the eye. This is an
 indicator of interest, friendliness, and self-confidence that
 must be practiced to become natural. Ask for help with this
 or practice with strangers that you will never see again. Try
 to be comfortable glancing at others. Practice to learn the
 proper amount of time to hold the contact. Keep glancing around
 the room. Stop for only a few seconds to catch someone's eye
 and then move on. Do not stare; it makes some people uncomfortable.
 TECHNICAL SKILLS: 27. LEARN HOW TO LEARN: Develop strategies
 and tools to learn faster, with less effort, and better comprehension.
 Develop a structure for memorizing, reading for speed and understanding,
 and strategies for taking tests to give the answers that they
 are seeking. Learn how to read and send body language. Learn
 how to interpret what is being said to you or about you. 28.
 DEVELOP GUIDELINES FOR LEARNING: Ask for help with note taking,
 underling books and articles, studying for tests, etc., to be
 more efficient and successful. Become organized with specific
 systems that you develop or borrow from others. 29. BUILD STRUCTURE
 INTO YOUR LIFE: Have a plan, daily, weekly, etc. Know what in
 advance what you plan to accomplish, so that you do not have
 to think about what to do. 30. TAKE YOUR TIME: It's okay to
 let people wait for a response. Don't be rushed. Pause to collect
 your thoughts. 31. READING SKILLS ARE SIGHT ORIENTED: Most Creative
 Thinkers learn reading best by memorizing whole words by associating
 them with pictures. Creative Thinkers have a visual technique
 of learning to read that must be supplemented with specific
 multi-dimensional assistance for words that have no mental picture
 or have multiple meanings. These are usually the small words
 that are commonly called "sight words," like: at, the, or you're.
 Fortunately there are only a few hundred of these troublesome
 words. 32. USE YOUR FINGERS TO KEEP YOUR PLACE IN READING: Following
 along with your fingers will help your visual focus and avoid
 distractions as you read. 33. UNDERLINE AS YOU READ: Underline
 important segments for memory, concentration, and comprehension.
 Review the underlined portions to summarize and review the material.
 34. LEARN TRICKS TO READ FASTER AND UNDERSTAND MORE: Try not
 to move your lips as you read. Mechanical movements will slow
 you. Try to take in more than one word at a time and reduce
 the number of eye fixations. Use flash cards to quickly recognize
 and say words and phrases. Practice speed reading with material
 that is not important, such as: newspapers, highway signs, or
 advertisements on television. 35. LEARN PHONICS FOR PRONUNCIATION
 AND SPELLING: Phonics is usually a difficult learning task for
 Creative Thinkers because of their non-verbal learning style.
 Learning to sound out words will help in making the sounds necessary
 to pronounce words and to spell them. 36. STUDY GRAMMAR AND
 PUNCTUATION: To understand the structure and meaning of reading
 and writing, you must unfortunately learn an area of particular
 difficulty to Creative Thinkers. 37. BREAK UP PROBLEMS INTO
 MANAGEABLE UNITS: Simple steps taken in an organized sequence
 will resolve all problems and avoid the feeling of being overwhelmed
 by tasks. Divide assignments into subsections and do each unit
 to create the whole. 38. PRACTICE RHYTHM, BALANCE, AND COORDINATION:
 Learning dance steps, the beat of music, juggling, and some
 crazy hand signs, like those at Club Med, will help you to stay
 centered and avoid the physical disorientation that can cause
 confusion and complicate learning. 39. REMEMBERING NUMBERS AND
 OTHER FACTS: Each of us has a limited amount of things like
 numbers that we can remember. Useful strategies can be learned,
 such as: stacking or forming groups; but learning to live with
 your personal capabilities is necessary to find your comfort
 zone. 40. REMEMBER NAMES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO YOU: Repeating
 over and over in your mind will help you to remember. You can
 also write down names and other facts. Lists help to remember.
 Play for time. If an answer will come to you shortly, start
 talking about the question as if you want to make sure you understand.
 The answer most likely will come to you and you can avoid the
 awkward period of silence that bothers some people. Socially
 say, "I need a little time to think please." Try to avoid the
 pauses in conversation by filling the time with small talk.
 41. USE LISTS: Make lists and establish priorities. Lists are
 a memory aid to keep track of what you need to have done or
 remember. 42. EXPAND YOUR VOCABULARY: The most important indicator
 of intelligence to other people is your personal vocabulary.
 Use a dictionary to look up the meaning of new words and expand
 your vocabulary. By using a game format in a vocabulary computer
 program you can have fun and learn new words. Pick up a new
 word or two every week or day and try to use it in the proper
 situation with your acquaintances. 43. USE A NOISE BLOCKER TO
 AVOID SOME DISTRACTIONS: An electronic device with earphones
 can block low frequency noises that may cause distractions.
 This device, or sometimes just background music, can help some
 people with concentration. 44. USE YOUR MIND TO ORGANIZE YOUR
 THOUGHTS: Daydreaming is a valuable tool. Practice silently,
 many times, before speaking. Get it together before you open
 your mouth. Athletes practice success by visualizing. Visualize
 and practice in your mind what you would like to accomplish.
 Be positive and see success. Leave time for Creative Thinking.
 45. BECOME COMPUTER LITERATE: Become familiar with computers
 so that you can communicate and learn at your pace, without
 personal negative comments. Understand how to use word processing
 and spreadsheet programs. 46. USE A COMPUTER TO WRITE: Word
 processing programs that include editing, spell checking, and
 grammar programs will support and enable your creativity. Word
 processing opens up the expressive skills of Creative Thinkers
 who usually have poor penmanship, and enables them to make changes
 easily. 47. USE A TAPE RECORDER: When listening and understanding
 are difficult, tape verbal information so that you can check
 your notes for accuracy. 48. WRITE MANY DRAFTS: Get your ideas
 down on paper or in the computer, in any form or order, so you
 can play with, develop, refine your creative efforts. Correct,
 and revise many times. Computers make it easier to create many
 drafts that will make the result of much greater quality and
 acceptance. 49. PARAPHRASE BACK: Feed back to others what they
 say to you, in your words. To show your understanding and make
 sure the other person agrees with your interpretation, give
 them back a summary. Look for a response of "exactly." 50. LEARN
 TO USE HAND SIGNS TO COMMUNICATE: Frequently it's easier and
 faster to shake your head yes or no or put up fingers to communicate
 than to formulate speech. In foreign countries where language
 is a barrier to communications various signs can substitute.
 When appropriate, just nod or give a hand sign rather than wait
 for the words to come to you. To ask the time point to your
 watch. To give the time, hold your watch up so the other person
 can read the time directly. 51. KNOW WHERE TO FIND EACH LETTER
 IN THE ALPHABET: Keep a card with the alphabet close by for
 reference when using the telephone book or the dictionary. A
 simple list of the alphabet to refer to will save time and effort
 if this is difficult for you. 52. USE YOUR STRENGTHS, VERBAL
 OR WRITING: If you speak better than you write, talk a lot.
 Speak up. If writing is more comfortable, write extra papers.
 Get your ideas down on paper. Take the time to do it right,
 and get help from others with spelling, grammar, editing, etc.
 Ask for extra assignments or submit unsolicited reports. 53.
 USE GAMES TO LEARN "CALCULATED" RISK TAKING: Some games, like
 backgammon, allow you to experiment with risk taking. Too little
 or too much risk and you can lose. Learn to play probabilities
 to get the best results. Experiment with taking greater risk
 in practice situations where you have little to lose. 54. THINK
 WITH AN OPEN MIND: Brainstorm, especially in your head with
 no constraints using many viewpoints, to examine solutions to
 problems. Explore all options. Attack problems from many angles.
 Brainstorming is easier for Creative Thinkers since they think
 in different terms and see various solutions. Use this advantage
 of new ideas. 55. PRINT RATHER THAN WRITE: If you cannot read
 your cursive writing or printing is faster, use printing. Use
 what ever is faster and accurate, except in school where you
 must learn the basics. 56. USE SUBCONSCIOUS ABILITIES: For difficult
 serious problems, think about the problem for a few minutes,
 go on to something else; and come back to the problem when your
 mind has some ideas. Write the ideas down and wait again, maybe
 as long as a few days. The computer in your brain will be running
 in the background, without any conscious effort on your part,
 to create solutions. 57. DIRECT ORAL DISCUSSIONS TO YOUR STRENGTHS:
 Ask questions and talk about subjects you know about; but only
 ask exploratory questions and listen when discussing topics
 that you do not know a lot about. Bring the subject around to
 your areas of knowledge by making a comment or asking a question.
 58. DECIDE IF YOU ARE A MULTI-SENSORY, COOPERATIVE, OR QUIET
 LEARNER: Do you need noise, music, or lots going on, or do you
 need a quite setting? Can you process multiple thoughts simultaneously?
 For quite learners a headset that cancels out noise can be a
 help. Do you work best alone or with others? Decide what works
 best for your creativity and production. Communicate your needs.
 Tell others how you feel that you learn best. 59. DO MATH WITH
 A CALCULATOR: Always estimate the answer first to see if the
 calculator's answer is in "the ball park." Use what ever is
 faster and accurate, except in school where you must learn the
 basics. 60. FIND A WAY TO KNOW THE DAY AND DATE: Use a digital
 watch, refer to the newspaper, or look at the clock in your
 computer. Know where to find information that you can not remember.
 Keep a desk calendar or other reminder if this is a problem
 for you. 61. LEARN REFERENCES FOR DIRECTIONS: Hold your hands
 up in front of you with the palms facing away. The thumb and
 index finger of the left hand makes an L, that is a reference
 for left. Recall compass directions by remembering that the
 sun rises in the East and sets in the West. Wearing a ring or
 watch on the left hand or wrist can help. CONCLUSIONS Creative
 Thinkers are unique because they learn, think, and respond differently
 to the world around them. Many people fail to comprehend the
 immense courage of people with learning differences and give
 up on these individuals prematurely. Creative Thinkers must
 be: Self-confident, Involved, Persistent, Structured, Questioners,
 Students of learning, Embracing of failure, Able to live comfortably
 with momentary confusion/disorientation,and Looking for successes.
 Above all else, Creative Thinkers must make use their unique
 mental abilities to think on a higher level. Creative Thinkers'
 strengths include: Persistence, Concentration, Perception, Vivid
 imagination, Creativity, Drive and ambition, Curiosity, Thinking
 in pictures instead of words, Superior reasoning, Capable of
 seeing things differently from others, Love of complexity, Simultaneous
 multiple thought processing, Quickly mastering new concepts,
 and Not following the Crowd. Creative Thinkers can frequently
 see the future clearer than others; because of their unique
 thought processing they can complete fragmentary perceptions
 into reality in their mind with the three-dimensional visualizations
 that they experience as reality. To achieve higher levels of
 success and unlock their sometimes supernatural abilities, Creative
 Thinkers need some coping strategies to develop a level of self
 confidence that is comfortable. Creative Thinkers may also wish
 to consult with a medical doctor, that is knowledgeable in treating
 dyslexia, to see if medication will help them as it has helped
 others, including the authors. Creative Thinkers need to learn
 to use deception to cover their weakness and direct activities
 to their strengths. The 61 common sense compensations discussed
 above will enable you to be "street smart," in control of your
 destiny, and enable you to concentrate on unlocking the genius
 abilities of Creative Thinking. We would like to hear from readers.
 Please write and let us know what you are doing to make a difference
 in your life and the details of any extra-ordinary mental experience
 that you have experienced. We are planning a follow-up book,
 "Learning to Unlock and Use Your Creative Thinking." APPENDIX

 E SOME PSYCHIC EXPERIENCES OF CREATIVE THINKERS CONTROLLING
 TIME: While skating down the ice in a hockey game, I see the
 play in slow motion unfold in my mind. I practice in my mind
 before I execute the play. DB In a hockey game, I was waiting
 for a pass from the corner of the rink and I was able to see
 the location to shoot on the goal and calculate the angle to
 take the pass and shoot in one motion. It was easy because everything
 seemed to be occurring in slow-motion. DB CONTROLLING EVENTS:
 Before I roll the dice in a backgammon game, I can frequently
 call the outcome, especially if I need a certain combination
 of numbers to make a desired move. CM I can make people do what
 I want them to do by thinking hard and passing a message to
 them from my mind without saying or doing anything. PREDICTING
 FUTURE OUTCOMES: I get a feeling about the future movement of
 prices like interest rates or stock prices that seems to be
 intuitive. JB Frequently, at places like Las Vegas, I get a
 mental picture of outcomes such as six wins then go away. It
 may seem like wishful thinking; but I find it to be true many
 times so I follow this message and press my bets. KM I practice
 when listening to a television advertisement that is going to
 read a telephone number. Frequently, I can say the number of
 most of it out loud before the announcer. JR COMMUNICATING TELEPATHICALLY:
 When someone is stuck for a word, I can frequently pass it to
 them by repeating it in my head and concentrating on the other
 person. VS DOING COMPLEX MATH MENTALLY: I can do square roots
 in my head. I just get an answer. BF I can solve many equations
 in my head. I do not need to through all the steps on paper,
 I see them in my head. DM SEEING SOLUTIONS FROM AN EXAMINATION
 OF THE PARTS: I look at computer programs and see problem areas,
 such as: logic or processing paths that are faster. I can see
 a picture in my mind of the whole program and rearrange it in
 my mind. MR I can enter a room that I have never been in before
 and sense things that appear to be out of place or don't belong
 there. DM The CIA used a psychic to locate the wreckage of a
 spy plane that went down in Africa, after satellites and other
 measures could not find it. The physic came up with the longitude
 and latitude and when the cameras were trained there the wreckage
 was seen. From: INSIGHT Magazine 10/23/95. end.
