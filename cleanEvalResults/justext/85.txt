<p>Electronic Patient Record (EPR)
JHH Allows clinicians to access
 documents describing a patient’s stay in the Hospital (i.e.
 Discharge Summaries, Operative Notes, Clinic Documents).  It
 allows the physician to finalize (i.e. “sign”) a document.
  It allows for a clinician to navigate through the various result
 reporting (Lab and Rad) systems and to get a listing of patients,
 either through a floor census or through a list associates with
 the physician.  This system is available to both JHH and to
 JH-Bayview, with specific coding for each institution. EPR Web
 allows access to EPR via the Web.

<p>Human Resources Management System (ISI)Integrated Payroll and
 Human Resources system.

<p>Interface Engine
A complex messaging standard, HL7, for the exchange
 of information between systems (patient admitted, lab result,
 radiology result, diet order ...).  An interface engine is a
 sort of router - applications which have something to say send
 messages to the interface engine, it checks to see which other
 systems have "subscribed" to that specific content type of the
 message, and forwards a copy of the message to them.  In the
 real world, different vendor's systems rarely agree on all aspects
 of the message formatting, so another major function of the
 interface engine is to reformat messages as needed for each
 recipient.  Our HL7 interface engine environment spans JHH and
 JHBMC, includes at least 60 clinical and administrative systems,
 and delivers about 3,000,000 messages a week.

<p>JHSecure (VPN)
