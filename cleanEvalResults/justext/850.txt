<p>Welcome to another Game.Ars. It's October, and that means it's
 time for horror movies and horror games to start rising from
 their graves in your town. I have only one goal for this month,
 and that is to be first in line for the new Chucky movie. If
 nothing else, Jennifer Tilly is worth the $10 ticket price:
 she's cute, funny and, uh, cute. And hey, come to think of it,
 where is our Chucky video game? Blizzard? Valve? Bioware? No?
 Oh, well. While we wait for someone to be brave enough to release
 a Chucky title, let's look at the past week in gaming news.

<h>Cha-ching!

<p>A new record was set at EB Games when The Sims 2 sold one million
 copies in just ten days. It's the biggest game launch for EA
 in more than 20 years. And this is not just an American fad
 &#151; according to EA's marketing VP, more than half of the
 sales were recorded across the pond, in Europe.

<h>A shot of Devil Whiskey

<p>Devil Whiskey, a hand-crafted role-playing game in the style
 of Bard's Tale and the older Might and Magic games is looking
 for a certified Linux/Unix System Administrator. I saw the post
 for the job early this week and have no idea if it's filled
 yet. This is the kind of thing that can really flesh out a resum&#233;,
 even if you're not specifically looking to break into the gaming
 field.

<h>Half-Life 2 stuck in court

<p>Two weeks ago I mentioned that Half-Life would be going gold
 soon, and that was correct. The game is officially "finished"
 &#151; with a gold candidate ready for approval. But Valve and
 Vivendi are biting at each other like rabid dogs over certain
 copyright issues.

<p>The legal jargon is all Greek to me. Even after reading up on
 the case, I don't fully understand what the logic behind the
 hold-up would be. What I do understand is that Half Life 2 could
 be delayed for up to six months, even if the gold candidate
 is approved, pressed, printed and packaged. According to Vivendi,
 Valve's claims that the game would be released in September
 were made without its consent.

<p>If you want more details, including some of the legalese, check
 out this article at Gamespot.com from Tuesday.

<h>Games: a recent history

<p>GameSpy put up a list of their "25 Most Memorable Games of the
 Past 5 Years." It's a good read over which to enjoy your morning
 coffee &#151; so I thought I'd link it here for anyone who missed
 it. I know that 5 years isn't exactly a trip down Nostalgia
 Street, but still, it made me realize just how much fun I've
 been having since 1999. Time goes by in a blur, so taking a
 look back over your shoulder to see where you've been once in
 a can be fun, if not instructive. Here's a snippet from the
 discussion about Deus Ex:

<p>"The truth was, it was actually a very linear game &#151; it
 didn't feel that way while you were playing it, though! At GameSpy
 it really opened our eyes. For weeks we talked about it with
 one another, and for years afterwards we compared games to it."
 

<h>Pirates off the starboard mouse!

<p>Taking a classic game, remaking it with current technology and
 releasing it on a new generation of gamers has become common
 practice. We're not talking sequels here; these are modern versions
 of the old-school originals. And unlike movie remakes, which
 usually do little to improve on the original, video games lend
 themselves quite well to this recycling practice.

<p>Sid Meier's Pirates! is one of my all-time favorite games. When
 I heard that Firaxis was releasing a re-make of it, I was terribly
 excited and curious about how much of the original gameplay
 would remain intact. It looks, from all I've read, to be on
 the right track, and as I speak (type?) Pirates is preparing
 to set sail.

<p>GameSpot.com has a new preview of the game with an interesting
 look at the design and development process. Ever hear of "iterative
 prototyping"? Yean, me neither.

<p> "It's a lot simpler than it sounds: iterative, because we work
 in a cyclical fashion, taking a pass at improving the game,
 stepping back to evaluate it, then building on that foundation
 with the next pass; and prototyping, because we start with simple
 models and simulations of things…" 

<p>You can check out the preview here where you'll learn more about
 Firaxis' design process and about some turn-based elements that
 made it into the game.

<h>Star power in Area 51

<p>Area 51, a game due for PS2 and Xbox next year, will put players
 in charge of investigating an attack at (you guessed it) Area
 51, the infamous UFO crash site and top secret US-government
 facility in the Nevada desert. Recently Midway Games announced
 that X-Files star David Duchovny will join Marilyn Manson and
 Powers Boothe as part of the voice-acting cast. Certainly, Duchovny
 was courted due to his work in the X-Files series, which was
 (and still is) a cult favorite for UFO-ologists and conspiracy
 theorists around the world.

<p>Area 51 is a first-person shooter that got a lot of good press
 at E3, and Paramount Pictures has already acquired rights to
 bring the game to the big screen. The hype is big-time but the
 game isn't due until March of 2005. We'll keep our eyes out
 for details as they surface. I understand that Area 51 is the
 conversion of a popular arcade game, but I've never played it.

<h>Bullet news

<l> SCi Entertainment and Davis Panzer Productions will partner
 to develop a video game based on Highlander. There can be only
 one!
