<h>The Dan Brown code

<p>Approximately three people still haven't read Dan Brown's The
 Da Vinci Code: Mark Liberman, David Lupher, and reportedly at
 least one other person (as yet unidentified).*

<p>Regrettably, neither Barbara nor I are able to claim that the
 third non-reader is one of us. What can I say by way of excuse
 for this? I found the book was on sale really cheap in CostCo
 when we were about to leave on a trip to Europe. I bought it
 for the long, long flights that lay ahead of us, without knowing
 much about it except that it was supposed to be an intellectual
 mystery with cryptography and symbology and stuff and the blurbs
 said it was great. I didn't open it, I just grabbed one off
 a pallet of about 500 copies. Barbara was between mysteries
 at the time, so she grabbed it from me and rapidly read it over
 the next couple of days before we even left for the airport.
 I asked hopefully what it was like. She scowled and said something
 about the Hardy Boys. My heart sank; I understood her to mean
 it was pathetic but possibly of interest to the 11-year-old
 market. By the time we were on our plane she had made sure that
 her flight bag contained a new novel by Menking Hannell, and
 over southern Oregon she told me it was great as usual. Unfortunately
 I had no better idea of what to do with my time, so I opened
 The Da Vinci Code.

<p>I am still trying to come up with a fully convincing account
 of just what it was about his very first sentence, indeed the
 very first word, that told me instantly that I was in for a
 very bad time stylistically.

<p>The Da Vinci Code may well be the only novel ever written that
 begins with the word renowned. Here is the paragraph with which
 the book opens. The scene (says a dateline under the chapter
 heading, 'Prologue') is the Louvre, late at night:

<p> Renowned curator Jacques Sauni&egrave;re staggered through the
 vaulted archway of the museum's Grand Gallery. He lunged for
 the nearest painting he could see, a Caravaggio. Grabbing the
 gilded frame, the seventy-six-year-old man heaved the masterpiece
 toward himself until it tore from the wall and Sauni&egrave;re
 collapsed backward in a heap beneath the canvas. 

<p>I think what enabled the first word to tip me off that I was
 about to spend a number of hours in the company of one of the
 worst prose stylists in the history of literature was this.
 Putting curriculum vitae details into complex modifiers on proper
 names or definite descriptions is what you do in journalistic
 stories about deaths; you just don't do it in describing an
 event in a narrative. So this might be reasonable text for the
 opening of a newspaper report the next day:

<p> Renowned curator Jacques Sauni&egrave;re died last night in
 the Louvre at the age of 76. 

<p>But Brown packs such details into the first two words of an action
 sequence &#151; details of not only his protagonist's profession
 but also his prestige in the field. It doesn't work here. It
 has the ring of utter ineptitude. The details have no relevance,
 of course, to what is being narrated (Sauni&egrave;re is fleeing
 an attacker and pulls down the painting to trigger the alarm
 system and the security gates). We could have deduced that he
 would be fairly well known in the museum trade from the fact
 that he was curating at the Louvre.

<p>The writing goes on in similar vein, committing style and word
 choice blunders in almost every paragraph (sometimes every line).
 Look at the phrase "the seventy-six-year-old man". It's a complete
 let-down: we knew he was a man &#151; the anaphoric pronoun
 "he" had just been used to refer to him. (This is perhaps where
 "curator" could have been slipped in for the first time, without
 "renowned", if the passage were rewritten.) Look at "heaved
 the masterpiece toward himself until it tore from the wall and
 Sauni&egrave;re collapsed backward in a heap beneath the canvas."
 We don't need to know it's a masterpiece (it's a Caravaggio
 hanging in the Louvre, that should be enough in the way of credentials,
 for heaven's sake). Surely "toward him" feels better than "toward
 himself" (though I guess both are grammatical here). Surely
 "tore from the wall" should be "tore away from the wall". Surely
 a single man can't fall into a heap (there's only him, that's
 not a heap). And why repeat the name "Sauni&egrave;re" here
 instead of the pronoun "he"? Who else is around? (Caravaggio
 hasn't been mentioned; "a Caravaggio" uses the name as an attributive
 modifier with conventionally elided head noun "painting". That
 isn't a mention of the man.)

<p>Well, actually, there is someone else around, but we only learn
 that three paragraphs down, after "a thundering iron gate" has
 fallen (by the way, it's the fall that makes a thundering noise:
 there's no such thing as a thundering gate). "The curator" (his
 profession is now named a second time in case you missed it)
 "...crawled out from under the canvas and scanned the cavernous
 space for someplace to hide" (the colloquial American "someplace"
 seems very odd here as compared with standard "somewhere").
 Then:

<p> A voice spoke, chillingly close. "Do not move."

<p>On his hands and knees, the curator froze, turning his head slowly.

<p>Only fifteen feet away, outside the sealed gate, the mountainous
 silhouette of his attacker stared through the iron bars. He
 was broad and tall, with ghost-pale skin and thinning white
 hair. His irises were pink with dark red pupils.

<p>Just count the infelicities here. A voice doesn't speak &#151;a
 person speaks; a voice is what a person speaks with. "Chillingly
 close" would be right in your ear, whereas this voice is fifteen
 feet away behind the thundering gate. The curator (do we really
 need to be told his profession a third time?) cannot slowly
 turn his head if he has frozen; freezing (as a voluntary human
 action) means temporarily ceasing all muscular movements. And
 crucially, a silhouette does not stare! A silhouette is a shadow.
 If Sauni&egrave;re can see the man's pale skin, thinning hair,
 iris color, and red pupils (all at fifteen feet), the man cannot
 possibly be in silhouette.

<p>Brown's writing is not just bad; it is staggeringly, clumsily,
 thoughtlessly, almost ingeniously bad. In some passages scarcely
 a word or phrase seems to have been carefully selected or compared
 with alternatives. I slogged through 454 pages of this syntactic
 swill, and it never gets much better. Why did I keep reading?
 Because London Heathrow is a long way from San Francisco International,
 and airline magazines are thin, and two-month-old Hollywood
 drivel on a small screen hanging two seats in front of my row
 did not appeal, that's why. And why did I keep the book instead
 of dropping it into a Heathrow trash bin? Because it seemed
 to me to be such a fund of lessons in how not to write.

<p>I don't think I'd want to say these things about a first-time
 novelist, it would seem a cruel blow to a budding career. But
 Dan Brown is all over the best-seller lists now. In paperback
 and hardback, and in many languages, he is a phenomenon. He
 is up there with the Stephen Kings and the John Grishams and
 nothing I say can conceivably harm him. He is a huge, blockbuster,
 worldwide success who can go anywhere he wants and need never
 work again. And he writes like the kind of freshman student
 who makes you want to give up the whole idea of teaching. Never
 mind the ridiculous plot and the stupid anagrams and puzzle
 clues as the book proceeds, this is a terrible, terrible example
 of the thriller-writer's craft.

<p>Which brings us to the question of the blurbs. "Dan Brown has
 to be one of the best, smartest, and most accomplished writers
 in the country," said Nelson DeMille, a bestselling author who
 has himself hit the #1 spot in the New York Times list. Unbelievable
 mendacity. And there are four other similar pieces of praise
 on the back cover. Together those blurbs convinced me to put
 this piece of garbage on the CostCo cart along with the the
 72-pack of toilet rolls. Thriller writers must have a code of
 honor that requires that they all praise each other's new novels,
 a kind of omerta that enjoins them to silence about the fact
 that some fellow member of the guild has given evidence of total
 stylistic cluelessness. A fraternal code of silence. We could
 call it... the Da Vinci code; or the Dan Brown code.

<p>*The third non-reader was unknown when this post was first drafted,
 but it has since been edited, and as of today (May 2, 2004)
 I can confirm that Bill Poser and Danny Yee are both claiming
 not to have read The Da Vinci Code. Fair enough. So at least
 four people have not read it. I just wish one of them was me.
