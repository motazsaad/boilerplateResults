<p> What did it grow from? For anything to grow, without being hollowed
 out, it need materials.
 The simlpe answer is that it transmogrified,
 but then it still need a sizeable object to start with.

<p>Yeah ... I need to read that novel - The Integral Trees - was
 it Niven who wrote that? yeah! (tho' that was a freefall environment....)

 Currently pondering R2, please hold...We're
 neutral, you're just too cheap to hire us.
 Remember, other
 people exist than yourself.

<p>OOC : 
 E=mc squared. Energy can be directly converted into mass,
 although it does take rather a lot of it. However, given the
 huge supply of energy available to things in open space without
 atmospheric shielding, and a length of time comparable to even
 our own relatively young planet of Earth, it is possible for
 enough energy to be converted into mass to form a planet-sized
 object. As gravity increases more atmosphere will be retained
 (assuming some sort of magnetic field, which is possible, just
 not very likely without minerals), and the thickness of the
 atmosphere, and probably an Ozone layer, which will block much
 of that radiation. By this time, though, the mass and dimension
 of the object will be sufficient to promote collisions with
 space-junk (meteors) which will also, very slowly, add to the
 mass of the body. Although, as metors tend to be Nickle and
 Iron rich, we return to minerals being present...somewhere.
 
 Atys may well have grown without any starting mass to grow
 from, a microscopic spore floating through space.

<p>The PvP Strike Team Letter also said they "would add a "PvP tag";
 it would be up to you to trigger the flag on or not." So I'm
 not too worried about griefing 1337s.

<p>
 Eh? L2 has a lil thingy called "karma" that turns your name
 red if you kill players for no good reason and this player doesn't
 fight back but that doesn't stop the 1337 kiddies from ganking...

<p>It probably started out as a single-cell organism, that started
 clumping together in a so-called bio-film. Within that film,
 certain cells developed in different directions all after what
 was needed in a symbiotic relationship, and slowly the first
 plants developed.

<p>
 How those cells developed, is another story. Several competing
 and complementing theories exist for the stages between the
 organic soup and the early cells.

<p>
 Btw, Atys must have some significant sources of carbon, oxygen
 and hydrogen near. Wood is made up of cellulose, hemi-cellulose
 and lignin, all of which are poly-saccharides, (C6H12O6)n. My
 guess is the big gas giant and its ring system.

 I hereby declare myself to be a Hominist. Ask me about my philosophy.

<p>This is very disappointing. I pay a monthly fee to play the game.
 I don't want to spend gametime surfing the web to figure out
 what's going on inside the game.

<p>
 I see the chronicles site as a missed opportunity. It has made
 it more difficult rather than easier to track things. Now we
 have to look in three places, the main lore/background pages
 on www.ryzom.com, the forums and now the chronicle site as well.
 It would be far better if the material was consolidated into
 one place. The background material needs a good overhaul and
 improvement too.
