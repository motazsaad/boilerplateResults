<h>One hundred miles down: Mosquitoes, loons and a skunk

<h>Monday, August 8, 2005Dave Hardesty

<p> Last week: After three hours of paddling, Hardesty had covered
 only about a mile due to the marshy vegetation. He asked his
 brother, Steve Hardesty, to pick him up and they drove past
 the marshy area to relaunch in a part of the river that could
 be navigated in the kayak. 

<p>Evening, Day 1: 

<p> While making camp this evening, I discovered one of my giant
 plastic bags had a hole in it, and was half full of water. It
 held my miscellaneous camping gear. Everything in it was also
 in small plastic bags, though, so it wasn't a major catastrophe.
 

<p> I did find out that waterproof matches are only waterproof up
 to a certain point. They will dry out. Next time, don't put
 them all in the same bag. 

<p> Dinner tonight was chicken and rice and Gatorade with granola
 and trailmix for dessert. I weighed just before I left home.
 I expect to lose a few pounds before I get back. 

<p> I'm just outside Bemidji, Minn. tonight, near Highway 2. I had
 enough cell phone signal to call home and talk to my wife, Marla.
 I know we won't always be that lucky. 

<p> Being able to hear each other's voice beats down the loneliness.
 That has definitely been the most negative aspect of this trip.
 It really started hitting home during the last few days before
 I left. I don't like to dwell on it. 

<p> It's 1:10 a.m. Sunday, July 31. I never sleep much the first
 couple of nights out like this. I'm used to quiet and the boonies
 is not quiet. Right now, I'm listening to what I think is a
 screech owl in a tree nearby, and occasional small and larger
 feet moving in the leaves. 

<p> The woods here aren't as noisy as those back home. Overall,
 I've seen less wildlife today than I would in Missouri. On a
 hot day in July in Missouri almost every log sticking out of
 the water is lined with turtles and the occasional water snake.
 

<p> I only saw four turtles on logs today and a snake that a heron
 dropped right in front of me. I think the short summer up here
 might be the reason. 

<p>Day Two: 

<p> While eating my breakfast of peanutbutter oatmeal with chopped
 up granola bar, I met a local this morning. 

<p> A skunk was ambling up to my campsite. I'm glad I saw him first.
 He took off when I yelled at him. I saw him because I was moving
 around doing the Minnesota boogie. 

<p> It is a dance of constant movement you do to get the mosquitoes
 off. They aren't as big as the mosquitoes we have at home, but
 what they lack in size they make up for in determination. If
 you have more than one on you (and you always do) you can slap
 one and the others won't move at all. 

<p> Got to Bemidji this morning at 10:20 a.m. It was sunny, about
 80 degrees with a light breeze. Like everyone else there, I
 had my picture taken with the giant statues of Paul Bunyan and
 his blue ox, Babe. Had a sandwich at a local fastfood restaurant
 while waiting for the visitors center to open. I wanted to get
 my favorite teacher a souvenier, but they didn't have a gift
 shop. They did let me recharge my cell phone and fill my water
 jugs, though. 

<p> By the time I left Bemidji at 1:30 p.m., the sky had clouded
 up and it looked like rain was coming. The wind had shifted
 to the west. I dug out my running jacket and lashed it down
 where I could reach it on the stern. As I was shoving off I
 found a leech on the floor of the cockpit. I had been warned
 about them, but this was the first I saw. 

<p> Bemidji sits on two lakes that are joined by a short channel.
 The first I came to was Lake Irvin. It was only a mile wide
 so I paddled straight across. When I was ready to leave Bemidji,
 I had to cross the second lake, Lake Bemidji, to the point where
 the river continues on its way. 

<p> The Department of Natural Resources' map warned about canoes
 and kayaks trying to go straight across the size of lake, as
 high winds can develop suddenly. This meant I had to paddle
 along the shoreline. It takes longer, but is safer. 

<p> After leaving the lake, the river became the color of ice tea,
 with vegetation lush and waving just below the surface. 

<p> This has been a constant since the start -- long strands of
 grass swaying with the current. It reminds me of Shelly Winters
 hair after Robert Mitchem, her preacher-husband, drowned her.
 

<p> Saw several loons today (I'd been hoping to see some as many
 "friends" told me I have the mental capacity of a loon after
 hearing about my trip). 

<p> I've decided I have more in common with them than our mental
 capacity. We both like to paddle and ride low in the water.
 

<p> Since the paddling was much easier today, I decided to push
 on to Indian Point campsite. I am 100 miles from the start and
 at the river's most northen point. From here it turns south
 like it's supposed to. From Lake Itaska the river traces a question-mark
 course through Minnesota. 

<p> Tonight I'm camped at the top of that question mark. Two miles
 before I got here, I had to portage Beltrami County Power Dam.
 That meant completely unpacking the kayak (TP II), carrying
 all its contents 201 yards to a point below the dam, and then
 carrying the kayak too. 

<p> It took two hours and that won't be the last dam to portage.
 When I got to this campsite, I met a young man planning to start
 a trip next year from Lake Itaska to the Gulf on Mexico. 

<p> We had a lot to talk about. There is also a group of girls,
 ages 10 to 12, with their camp counselors. They seem to be having
 a lot of fun. 

<p> Some wanted to tell ghost stories, but that got vetoed so now
 they are singing. They are about to put me to sleep, so I'll
 just let them.
