<h> Let's face it: This system is big. This system is complex. This
 system is: Formidable. 

<p>I originally didn't have this chapter in mind, but after talking
 with my first adopter, found myself writing additional information
 about how to start. So here it is. 

<p>The most important thing to do is: START SMALL. 

<p>Here's the plan: 

<l>Make a pan-subjects speed list. 

<l>Identify Patterns. Make 1/2 Subjects. Make a GSMOC. 

<l>Create your first subject. 

<l>Onward and Upwards! 

<p>1. MAKE A PAN-SUBJECTS SPEED LIST. 

<p>You can either make one on your own, or, (and I highly recommend
 this:), go to http://speakeasy.org/ lion/nb, and download the
 Word .doc pan-subjects speed template. 

<p>Make/Print-out a few of them. 

<p>Then just start taking notes. 

<p>As interesting ideas occur to you, just start taking notes. 

<p>Don't worry about ``subject''. Hell, if you are uncomfortable
 with it, don't even worry about ``hint''. 

<p>You're new to this. Cut yourself some slack! 

<p>Just do this for a while. Maybe a day or two, until you get about
 20-50 speed thoughts, whatever you are comfortable with. 

<p>2. IDENTIFY PATTERNS. MAKE 1/2 SUBJECTS. MAKE A GSMOC. 

<p>Go over your pan-subject speeds. Locate patterns- Ask yourself:
 

<l>What kinds of things am I thinking about? 

<l>What do I care about? 

<l>What are some important studies among these thoughts? 

<p>From these, you should get some ideas for your first subjects.
 

<p>DON'T WORRY if you find that among 20 speed thoughts, you have
 15 different subjects..! 

<p>Don't worry AT ALL about the scatter! 

<p>What you will find, is that, as you develop your subjects, many
 will *attract* your thoughts to them, and become *focuses*.
 It's sort of like a gravitational mass: You start collecting
 some thoughts, and then they start collecting more thoughts-
 and then... 

<p>And don't worry, we're just putting these ideas into half subjects.
 That means we aren't doing tabs and what not here. We're just
 maintaining speed lists for the subjects. 

<p>So, you're finding patterns. 

<p>Then, either make your own subject speed lists, or print some
 out from the web page. (I recommend the print-outs.) 

<p>Don't worry- they're free. I'm not charging for this. (Because
 I'm craaaAAaazy Al!) Just get 'em and print 'em out. 

<p>Transcribe from the pan-subject speeds to the half subjects.
 

<p>At this point, we're doing good, but we haven't really transcended
 the ``bucket'' level of notebook systems. 

<p>(Remember what I said at the beginning of this book: 99notebook
 systems out there today are just the ``bucket'' system, or the
 ``diary'' system, or some basic combination of the two.) 

<p>Now, you should get a binder at this point. Put the subject speeds
 into the binder. Put some blank template pages (blank pan-subject
 speed pages and single subject speed pages) into the binder,
 and put in your subjet speeds, alphabetically. 

<p>You'll also make GSMOCv1- the first version of your GSMOC. Remember,
 the first version will contain your first GSR on it as well.
 No need to alphabetise, the list is so small. 

<p>Now do this for a while. 

<p>Do this untill one of your subjects reaches, say, 10-20 speeds.
 

<p>3. CREATE YOUR FIRST SUBJECT. 

<p>Since you have only one, you can just store it in your carry-about
 binder, at this point. 

<p>Make a SMOC, and start practicing the mapping process. 

<p>Make your first map of your thoughts- you may want to reread
 the walkthrough in chapter 3 of making a map, *BUT THIS TIME
 WITH YOUR VERY OWN THOUGHTS!* 

<p>Now you'll start to see the POWER of this system. 

<p>The MAP is where it all comes together- LITERALLY! 

<p>4. ONWARD AND UPWARD! 

<p>DO THIS AGAIN! 

<p>Make more subjects! 

<p>And start writing POIs! 

<p>Start getting a little strategic. 

<p>You'll also start having problems- REREAD THIS BOOK! 

<p>You'll start seeing why things are set up the way they are. You'll
 start having dillemas in placing thoughts- reread my suggested
 rules for subject splitting, and see if they make sense to you.
 

<p>You are just starting to learn this system! When you've DONE
 it yourself, it's a totally different thing- and VERY exciting!
 

<p>You'll start to see the need for P and P, and you'll start having
 tensions between subjects. REFLECT THEM ON THE GSMOC. 

<p>Keep building new half subjects, and then promoting them to full
 subjects. 

<p>You'll find that time is limited- NOW USE THOSE STICKY TABS!
 

<p>Arrange to go on your shopping trip, if you haven't already,
 and get the pieces that can help move you along. 

<p>By this point, you shouldn't need much help. 

<p>You'll see how the ideas at work here fit together, and your
 paper intake will increase. You'll start integrating your study
 and research into the system, and lining it up on the maps.
 

<p>You'll probably start to see little things that I knew but forgot
 to put in here, and you'll start to see what I mean by ``immobilizing''.
 

<p>And yet, if you are anything like me, you'll perceive value in
 this, and continue on. 

<p>TIME WILL PASS. 

<p>I predict: 

<p>The more you think and value and reflect, the more you will be
 COMPELLED TO ACTION. You will gravitate towards something, or
 some things, and you'll see things in your head that you've
 never seen before. Things that are so real - you can touch them.
 

<p>You may question the relative significance of the physical world,
 compared to the realm of ideas. Things take on new dimensions.
 

<p>And you are COMPELLED TO ACT in NEW WAYS. 

<p>EVENTUALLY: 

<p>You will NEED TO STOP. 

<p>And you will do so. 

<p>And you will ACT. 

<p>And your acts will be organized. 

<p>I am just speculating now- I am the only person who has ever
 practiced the notebook system I am describing. 

<p>But let me tell you- 

<p>I HAVE NEVER COMPLETED A MAJOR PROJECT. 

<p>I mean, sure, there have been some minor projects. And I have
 completed major WORK projects, that I was paid to complete.
 

<p>But I have very rarely copmleted MAJOR projects. Not that I can
 remember. 

<p>WELL, I'm IN THE LAST LINES OF THIS BOOK. 

<p>Granted, the book is rough. 

<p>Granted, the book is gritty. 

<p>But GOD DAMN IT, if I'm not writing on the 6,831st line..! 

<p>I, who have never written a complete book, have finished this
 thing. 

<p>Well, maybe I'm overthinking things, but this is not common in
 my life. I know my weaknesses, I accept them. 

<p>But I have a theory: That the Notebook system is somehow a focusing
 system of not only THOUGHTS, but ALSO of some sort of MENTAL
 ENERGY. And that it BUILDS, and BUILDS, and BUILDS as you THINK,
 THINK, and THINK. 

<p>And that when you are DONE THINKING, you are COMPELLED TO ACT.
 

<p>And the action WORKS. 

<p>Again: I HAVE NEVER WRITTEN A BOOK. 

<p>Now: To be honest, it's a shabby book. I know. I'm not an experienced
 writer. But here it is..! It's shabby, but it's a book! It's
 practice! 

<p>And I am immensly proud of this. 

<p>I suspect it is due to the notebook system working. 

<p>So: 

<p>Let me know how it works for you. 

<p>I am tired now. You can tell in my writing. This has been an
 exhausting effort, this whole last week and a day. But it's
 over now. 

<p>I feel like I've just lectured for a whole week straight. With
 work in between. So please forgive my tiredness. 

<p>But I want to say: 

<p>LET ME KNOW HOW IT GOES! 

<p>EMAIL me: lion@speakeasy.org. Tell me, personally, how it goes.
 

<p>And if you implement the computer system, or want to, or want
 to help, or want to see how it's going, go to my web page: 

<p> http://speakeasy.org/ lion/nb/ 

<p>...and check to see how it's going. And if it's NOT, maybe that's
 probably because your the first to try: Email me at lion@speakeasy.org,
 and let me know you want to start, and I'll link people to you.
 

<p>You can work together or seperate, however you like. 

<p>And feel free to call me, or write to me. 

<p>I LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU! 

<p> Lion Kimbro 12038 31st Ave NE #201 Seattle, WA 98125 

<p> 206.440.0247 &lt;- YES, you can CALL! Just say "I read your
 notebooks book." 

<p>Call at whatever crazy hour. Let me know. 

<p>Maybe you live in India or China or something. But if it isn't
 too expensive, call and let me know. I'd love to hear from you.
 

<p>And if you have any questions, or thoughts, or anything, feel
 free to let me know what they are. 

<p>If you want to help with the web page, or make a discussion board,
 or a wiki, or SOMETHING, let me know. 

<p>Oh! If you want to donate money! You can do that to. My paypal
 thingy is also under ``lion@speakeasy.org''. 

<p>That'd be great. Then Kitty (my girlfriend) might also feel that
 the notebook system was worth something. &lt;laugh&gt;
