<h> It Starts 

<p>It had been rumored that the terrorist strongholds, including
 Fallujah, would be reduced starting in October.

<p>
And what do you know, although it's still Sept. 30 here, in
 Iraq it's already Oct. 1, and the offensive has begun!

<p>
This is just as I had hoped. Rather than react to the provocations
 last Spring, that were designed to create a joint Sunni-Shia
 revolt, with Sadr in the South and Zarqawi to the North, we
 contained those uprisings without giving them the pre-packaged
 media victory that was sought.

<p>
Rather than just level the city, we were being much smarter.
 The Russians levelled Grozny a few years ago, and that didn't
 do them any good.

<p>
As operations unfolded last Spring with the Marines in Fallujah
 before they tried their experiment of handing security over
 to locals, we discovered they had perfected a new form of urban
 fighting that was incredibly safe for our troops and lethal
 for the enemy, that relied on heavy use of snipers, precision
 strikes, and remorseless robotic drone surveillence.

<p>
Instead, we spent the Summer gathering intelligence, making
 databases, finding out who was who, and gradually preparing
 the battlespace with almost daily airstrikes on Fallujah and
 elsewhere. And while holding the line with the Sunnis, we turned
 our attention to Sadr's Iranian-backed "Mahdi Army", and without
 a great deal of fanfare, exterminated them by the thousands.

<p>
So now we're going in hard. They probably know exactly where
 the enemy is. The force is a full brigade -- that's a serious
 attack with several thousand soldiers and combined heavy arms.

<p>
The other reason for the delay was to wait for more, better-trained
 Iraqi forces to follow-up our victory, which weren't available
 last Spring, as ultimately the ongoing security has to be provided
 by Iraq itself. And there's a government for them to be loyal
 to.

<p>
We also find

<p>
senior military officials said U.S. and Iraqi troops in the
 past month have killed or captured more than 100 al-Zarqawi
 associates and have killed six members of al-Zarqawi's inner
 circle.

<p>I also think this is highly amusing that it starts mere hours
 before the first Presidential Debate. It could have been yesterday,
 it could have been tomorrow, but instead it's right now. Ha!

<h> Global Warming 

<p>Is the globe warming?

<p>
Sure.

<p>
Do we have anything to do with it, and can we even do anything
 about it?

<p>
Answers to both of those questions are far less clear.

<p>
What we do know is the globe was much warmer than it is now
 in relatively recent times, only about 1,000 years ago. That
 was in the Middle Ages. They weren't making much Greenhouse
 Gas then.

<p>
The recent warming is only relative to a particularly cold spell
 around 1600. It was rather nasty, and is called "The Little
 Ice Age". The warming since then corresponds, it turns out,
 to an increase in solar activity as measured by sunspots.

<p>
We're actually due for another Ice Age. Wouldn't that be just
 grand? Imagine Boston under a sheet of ice, oh, about a mile
 deep!

<p>
We'd be begging for a little global warming then, wouldn't we?

<p>
It turns out the famous academic paper that everyone latched
 onto, that seemed to show temperatures shooting up in recent
 decades, higher than ever before, was all wrong.

<p>
But John Kerry says he's going to still go with junk science
 and reduce emissions that contribute to "global warming".

<p>
What that really means is, lower your standard of living.

<p>
What does Kerry care? He's got his "family" SUV. He can afford
 to have energy cost more without it affecting his lifestyle.

<p>
How about you? How much extra money do you have sloshing around,
 that you can freely spend on higher energy costs without caring?

<p>
They say Bush is the candidate of the Rich. Sure, Bush is probably
 like 50 times richer than I am. But you know what? Kerry is
 actually about 50 times richer than Bush! And it's only one
 more step of 50-times from Kerry to Bill Gates, the world's
 richest man.

<p>
That Kerry pretends to be the candidate of the common man, or
 the little guy, is something that can hardly be said with a
 straight face.

<p>
These dour Malthusians are always wrong, always have been, and
 always will be. They always want you to cut back and consume
 less. Look, if a resource is finite, there's no use conserving
 it, as it's just going to run out anyway, and no one's ever
 going to do anything about it until it's gone, so you might
 as well use it! Finding something new is always going to be
 somebody's problem in the future, what do we care exactly when
 that happens?

<p>
The fact is, there's actually more proven oil reserves in the
 world today than at any point in history! That's right, we have
 more and more supplies each year rather than less and less,
 because it's being found and exploited faster than it's being
 consumed. That's hardly what I'd call "running out". And there's
 lots more oil in the world than in "proven reserves"!

<p>
In fact, it's not accepted yet, but there is some evidence that
 oil in fact is not a "fossil fuel" like coal (of which we have
 gargantuan quantities), but rather a substance that is being
 continually produced deep within the Earth! Wouldn't that be
 something, if oil turned out to be renewable?

<p>
I'm always surprised that people when I tell them these things
 aren't happy, but rather disappointed, as they hoped we'd be
 running out of oil so we'd turn to "cleaner" sources.

<p>
One wonders just what level of immaculate cleanliness will finally
 satisfy them.

<p>
One often hears the "statistic" that the greedy, gluttonous
 United States, "with only 5% of the world's population, consumes
 30% of the world's resources!" I got news for ya, that's deliberately
 constructed to mislead. As if our "consumption" of any particular
 "resource" prevented someone else from using all they needed!

<p>
You're supposed to imagine a fixed pie, you see, and we're grabbing
 a bigger slice than is fair, when everyone else goes hungry
 with the crumbs. That's not how it works! The other half of
 the story is we produce 30% of all the world's goods and services
 with those resources!

<p>
In a closed system, consumption equals production, by definition.
 I mean really, we only "consume" a resource in order to process
 it into something else. And if we didn't "consume" it, wouldn't
 the other countries that wanted to export it to us to sell for
 money so they could buy food be really unhappy if we stopped
 "consuming" what they had to offer? If we didn't "consume" so
 much, the rest of the world would fall into poverty!

<p>
But the "environmentalists" who dreamed up that saying know
 that, but they want to mislead you to thinking we're taking
 the bread out of the mouths of Third Worlders, just to make
 you feel guilty about being an American, and to despise the
 Capitalist system that creates enormous wealth and prosperity.

<p>
I've listened to many of these people, and in unguarded moments
 they always reveal the same wish: that 4 or 5 billion people
 would be killed off, preferably by something we were ourselves
 responsible for, and then the rest (including, presumably, themselves),
 would live in some fantasy pre-modern Eden, in tune with Mother
 Earth (oh, I'm sorry, "Gaia"), and in harmony with Nature, completely
 non-exploitively, whatever that means.

<p>
Somehow they imagine modern medicine will still magically survive,
 and that mana will fall from heaven, or the fields will clear
 and sow themselves.

<h> Get a Grip 

<p>The naysayers are out in force. For example, James Fallows  argues
 the Iraq war was a terrible distraction:

<p>
Among the opportunities lost, Fallows argues, were a chance
 to reassess our "inglorious bargain" with Saudi Arabia, a chance
 to wage a comprehensive war on terror, and a chance to improve
 the situation in Afghanistan—all amid a climate of international
 solidarity that followed September 11.

<p>Perhaps the most worrisome development, Fallows suggests, concerns
 the threat posed by the other members of the "axis of evil"—the
 ones that we know have or are developing weapons of mass destruction.
 With our standing in the international community diminished,
 our military considerably weakened, and the trustworthiness
 of our intelligence in doubt, he explains, Iran and North Korea
 have much less to fear from America than they did before Iraq:
 "the United States now has no good options for dealing with
 either country."

<p>Get a Grip!

<p>
I don't find it convincing. Assume there was no Iraq war. Then
 what? All sorts of magic seems to happen. Let's even assume
 Afghanistan, because of that, somehow vaulted to a modern, rebuilt,
 thriving Eden. How does that really help us? What extra measures
 could be taken against NK and Iran? It doesn't lay out how we'd
 stop those programs -- would the rest of the world just like
 us more and so do our bidding?

<p>
Not likely.

<p>
NK already has the bomb, we'd still have no direct easy military
 option regardless of the Iraq war! We can't go back in time
 to the Clinton administration and change that! In fact, NK is
 stalling further talks until AFTER the U.S. election -- obviously
 hoping to hold out for a Kerry Presidency!

<p>
You got that? The Evil Dwarf of Pyongyang is hoping for Kerry
 win so he can keep forcing his people to resort to cannibalism
 and eating grass to avoid starvation.

<p>
Actions have consequences. Think very hard about who around
 the world will benefit and rejoice from a Kerry win, and who
 will will be crushed and dispirited.

<p>
With millions of oppressed souls hoping for a Bush win, to vote
 for Kerry under these circumstances just to feel better about
 yourself at the coffee house with all your pseudointellectual
 friends -- when the man doesn't even have any coherent policy
 anyone can articulate -- is sinful self-indulgence worthy of
 nothing but scorn.

<p>
Sure, Bush has made mistakes. He's not all we might want. But
 does anyone honestly believe Kerry will be more aggressive in
 waging the WWIV?

<p>
Or will he cut and run under some sort of "peace with honor"
 rhetoric?

<p>
With respect to Iran, we're working hard -- very hard -- to
 get Europe to support security council sanctions, and they're
 refusing. Not going into Iraq wouldn't change that. There's
 nothing to stop us from bombing Iran, and being in Iraq makes
 it SO much easier to do so!

<p>
Also, the draining air patrols of the no-fly zones over Iraq
 we had been maintaining for 12 years are over, which has really
 freed up the air force. We couldn't be BETTER positioned to
 launch sustained punitive strikes into Iran!

<p>
In fact, one might argue that if Bush lost a year, then heck,
 we need to give him 4 more to finish up! Not following through
 on regime change everywhere in the Middle East WOULD turn this
 into a lost, wasted cause.

<p>
So how would more "attention" to those problems make them go
 away, as if thinking about them equates to solving them? There
 are no purely diplomatic solutions to Iran or NK.

<p>
Would Arabs stop using terrorism because a completely different
 ethnic group is being successful in Afghanistan? Would inspectors
 still be in Iraq, or would they have long departed, allowing
 him to start up his nuclear weapons programs that everyone agrees
 he had waiting in the wings? 

<p>
The basic problem with their analysis is its fundamental view
 of the source of terrorism. It believes it comes down to our
 "policies", meaning support of Israel; they seem to imply more
 Arab-friendly policies would get them off our back, which is
 a recipe for appeasement.

<p>
Instead, the real root cause has to be addressed, and the only
 way to do that is what we're trying to do: inject the virus
 of liberty and capitalism and modernism directly into the heart
 of the Arab world. And we've positioned ourselves strategically
 to strangle Iran and pressure Syria, the last 2 big bastions
 of terror-supporting regimes in the Middle East.

<p>
The critics don't provide any alternate concrete plan, other
 than to imply things would magically be better without the mistakes
 they can easily point to in hindsight. Attacks have increased?
 That's not the measure of success! Of course they will increase,
 because we've ratcheted up the war and turned it hot. That's
 like complaining that battles with Germans increased in 1943
 and 1944, ignoring that the battleline was moving closer and
 closer to Berlin. The real question is WHERE the terror attacks
 are happening -- and they're not happening here, they've been
 confined to the Muslim world and the underside of Europe, which
 is pushing back the battleline.

<p>
I can't understand the metrics these critics are using. They
 lack all sense of scale with history.

<p>
Quagmire? In the last 6 months, since the "uprising" started,
 our casualty rate has been under 3/day. By comparison, in 1968,
 it was 41/day over that worst year. In ww2, is was 205/day.
 Civil War, 480/day. The Germans were losing 2,500/day in ww2,
 and the Soviets 10,000/day -- and that's what winning looked
 like!

<p>
Then these complaints that we're "using up" the reserves? That's
 what they're for! Rather than being "stretched", the army is
 getting stronger, as everyone is turning into an experienced
 veteran.

<p>
We can strike them wherever they are. It's a big country, having
 more troops doesn't really help with that. The question is,
 are there missions not being performed because of too few troops?The
 answer is no, from what I'm hearing, both in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 They're not there to patrol like cops, there could never even
 in principle ever be enough to do that, that's for local forces.

<p>
The true "root cause" of Islamic terrorism is a combination
 of a lack of modernity, capitalism, and liberty, ignited by
 a literalist Islamic ideology, and evangelized by Saudi and
 Iranian money and clerics. If Saudi is going to come down, Iraq's
 oil had to be freed from an unfriendly tyrant first as a strategic
 move for the sake of the world's economy: China and Japan need
 foreign oil even more than we do. If Iran is going to come down
 without driving the friendly population to support the mullahs
 by invading, it could be done easily by a blockade of its one-dimensional
 export-dependent economy, which requires sealing its borders,
 which means having troops in Afghanistan and Iraq and free use
 of the Gulf without interference of Hussein's missiles and provocations,
 which all required as a first-step strategic move the invasion
 of Iraq.

<p>
While many of the armchair strategists, including myself, are
 enormously frustrated by lack of decisive retaliation in Fallujah,
 and of sparing the mosque at Najaf -- the Jacksonian impulse
 is to level the places -- there could be a good reason.

<p>
Either the Bushies are all micromanaging dopes who suddenly
 got squeamish, or they're (including the generals) incredibly
 level-headed professionals making shrewd game-theory decisions.
 The whole plan of the terror masters was specifically to create
 "events" in Fallujah and Najaf, to provoke an overwhelming response,
 for which they had set up many women and children to be casualties
 for propaganda purposes, all captured on al-Jazeera cameras.
 Iran was hoping we'd bomb the mosque!

<p>
The major strategies of our opponents in Iraq -- to try to ignite
 a civil war and/or a general uprising against us -- is failing
 miserably! In a country of over 20 million people, at most 0.1%
 are mobilized against us, and many of those are foreign imports.

<p>
By not giving them what they want, their staged events become
 apparent tactical victories for them but actual strategic defeats.
 We keep Sadr around because he's so inept - the risk is someone
 better might replace him!

<p>
Syria and Iran and even the Saudis realize they cannot survive
 long if Iraq is transformed. They're pulling out all the stops.
 Terror and the states that support it are not distinct -- Iraq
 is indeed the central theatre in the GWOT, as it focuses all
 our enemy's efforts there.

<p>
It's really al-Qaeda that's the sideshow. The critics are complaining
 we're not going after the mosquitoes, when the real solution
 is to drain the swamp of the states that support them. That
 requires changing all those societies by dragging them out of
 the middle ages. Don't miss the forest for the trees!

<h> The Problem With Democrats 

<p>The big problem with the Democrats today is they lack any purpose,
 apparently, other than pursuing power at all costs, even to
 the detriment of the country.

<p>
That's because they succeeded marvelously in enacting all their
 major socially progressive programs that were their prime raison
 d'etre over the last century, and have simply outlived their
 usefulness.

<p>
Workers' rights? Check. Social Security? Yep. Unemployment?
 Civil Rights? Education programs? We've got it all.

<p>
And we thank them for it. Really.

<p>
These programs are imperfect, but they function in the real
 world, given finite resources. No, all poverty and misfortune
 and injustice have not been purged from society, but they never
 will be. Conservatives, distrustful of large government programs,
 are satisfied with "good enough"; idealistic revolutionaries
 are never happy until perfection is achieved, even if it means
 fascistically stomping on people "in the way" of "progress".

<p>
It is a combination of this partial success, along with general
 American optimism, that makes class warfare a losing issue for
 the Democrats, even with many of the working class. Not everything
 in life is economic, and even then, many harbor the desire to
 become rich and don't want to find that being rich has been
 outlawed once they get there!

<p>
The social programs in place may be tinkered with, but they
 are not going away. And pushing them further and making them
 bigger just leads to prohibitively high taxes and regulation
 that drags down all growth and expansion.

<p>
The one thing the Left has never come to grips with is where
 production comes from.

<p>
What, stuff just falls from heaven everyday, does it?

<p>
In physics, it's a Law of Thermodynamics that useful work cannot
 be extracted from a heat engine unless a temperature differential
 exists: you get heat energy to flow from the hot place to the
 cold place, and in the process can divert some of it into work.

<p>
I believe a similar concept must apply in Economics: useful
 economic activity cannot take place unless there exist differences
 in wealth across which money will flow. The richer person has
 the disposable cash to spend, the poorer person has an incentive
 to do work to get that money.

<p>
It's an unpleasant system, but otherwise there's no incentive
 for any economic activity.

<p>
And then everyone's equally poor.

<p>
One might wish otherwise, but that's reality.

<p>
The small businessman -- not an elite, country-club figure at
 all -- is more likely to identify with Republicans once they
 find the tangle of laws and taxes and hoops and red-tape they
 have to go through just to try to start up their business!

<p>
So just "more of the same" from the Democrats is not welcome.
 And they are not needed to preserve what has already been won.

<p>
Unable to reinvent themselves, they seem to be simply grasping
 for power for its own sake, and it's quite unbecoming.

<p>
I listen to these Democrat attack dogs making insane proclamations
 that Iraq was never a threat, and we're less safe now, and only
 turned Iraq into a terrorist "haven" by invading.

<p>
Even assuming that last point were true, isn't that exactly
 what we'd like, to create a high concentration of terrorists
 in a country other than our own, that also just happens to host
 half our army with free reign to strike the terrorists whenever
 they are found?

<p>
I can't believe these people truly believe the illogical nonsequitors
 they spout. They can only be engaging in sophistry and rhetoric
 for the sake of winning debating points, and they have to know
 it.

<p>
And to do so in the middle of a war, with lives on the line
 every day, merely for their own ambitions, is the very definition
 of disloyalty.

<p>
Yes, the Democrat party is disloyal to America.

<p>
Disloyal! Seditious! Traitorous!

<p>
In the present circumstances, I can't possibly understand how
 anyone can justify a vote for a member of this party, let alone
 for positionless Kerry-Kerry-Quite-Contrary. Nostalgia isn't
 a good enough reason. What have Democrats done for us lately?

<p>
Their behavior is disgraceful and unjustifiable -- except in
 their own minds because their "cause" is "good".

<p>
Ever notice that the Left is always about Motive? That's all
 that matters. Purity of Motive. They strive for some social
 Utopia, so any atrocity or dirty trick is allowed, nay, even
 demanded, in pursuit of that Greater Good! Witness trying to
 steal the 2000 election by corrupt recounts, or the willful
 use of forged documents in Rathergate.

<p>
But the obvious good of freeing 50 million people from terrible,
 oppressive totalitarians of the very worst sort is derided by
 the Left, simply because they don't trust Bush's Motives. The
 tangible outcome for the liberated is less important to the
 Left than the pleasure of refusing to give credit to Bush because
 he has to be driven by oil or Halliburton or Karl Rove, rather
 than by high-minded ideals of social justice.

<p>
What miserable, useless people!

<p>
Some, however, have seen the light: witness this interview with
 former Lefty Christopher Hitchens, in which the interviewer
 is appalled at his 9/11 conversion to neo-conservatism, when
 the scales were finally burned from his eyes by what happened
 that day, and he saw that mere political points were less important
 than, you know, fighting real Evil.

<p>
And this Evil isn't Capitalism or "the Man", it's Islamic Fascism.

<p>
And it's new ally, the anti-bourgeoisie (and hence anti-American)
 Left.

<h> Clarification 

<p>A clarification to the previous posting, "Elections &amp; Foreigners"
 -- it was implied, but perhaps not obvious, that when I was
 talking about foreign opinions not mattering, it was intended
 specifically with respect to United States policies. I did not
 mean that in a broader sense!

<p>
As a further example, I recall this same Portugese student was
 also at the time circulating petitions in support of gun bans,
 which I felt was outrageous meddling in our affairs, especially
 as he was not planning on living here very long anyway.

<p>
And my recommendation is for them to strengthen themselves so
 as not to be overly pre-occupied with U.S. issues, rather than
 demanding a vote to compensate their own weakness.

<p>
This illustrates the impulse behind claims we must be beholden
 to the United Nations, which in effect gives the rest of the
 world an unearned veto power over our actions.

<h> Elections & Foreigners 

<p>Back in the early 90s, whilst in graduate school, a fellow student
 in the physics department who was from Portugal (and was a rather
 bright fellow), would make comments to the effect that the United
 States was the source of all the world's problems, and the only
 way there would ever truly be lasting peace would be if all
 the other countries in the world got together "to smash the
 U.S."

<p>
Such a patently absurd, not to mention rude, point of view caused
 me great consternation for quite some time.

<p>
Until I realized, with contented satisfaction, that this person's
 opinions mattered not one teensie tiny little bit in the big
 scheme of things, because he was not an American, and couldn't
 vote in our elections.

<p>
But my opinion did matter.

<p>
The most powerful government in the world courts my vote, not
 his.

<p>
And thus he was as ignorable as the inconsequential brayings
 of a jackass.

<p>
I found it further ironic (beyond the obvious point of him coming
 here to study) that although he could have become an American,
 as our way of life is theoretically open to all, and thus elevated
 himself to having opinions of significance, I doubted I could
 have ever become Portugese if I wanted to; they even have official
 lists of approved Portugese names for babies that must be used
 on all birth certificates there, so not being native born I
 would surely not be welcome.

<p>
And of course he (and his wife who was also studying here) planned
 to go back to Portugal -- a kind of Workers Paradise, to hear
 him describe it -- to raise a family, as it was just so horrible
 and violent here.

<p>
He was apoplectic over my explanation of how deadly force was
 allowed in most states to defend one's home against intruders
 -- to him this was barbaric and he couldn't understand why there
 wasn't an epidemic of people just inviting their enemies over
 for tea and then freely murdering them by claiming they were
 intruders.

<p>
Anyway, it seems they're finally on to us, realizing their impotence:
 witness this article making a case that the rest of the world
 should be able to vote in U.S. elections because the outcome
 will affect them. They even have the gall to quote the Declaration
 of Independence:

<p>
That 1776 declaration is worth rereading. Its very first sentence
 demands "a decent respect to the opinions of mankind": isn't
 that exactly what the world would like from America today? The
 document goes on to excoriate the distant emperor George for
 his recklessness, insisting that authority is only legitimate
 when it enjoys "the consent of the governed". As the world's
 sole superpower, the US now has global authority. But where
 is the consent?

<p>It's a novel passive/aggressive argument: claiming a right to
 political power precisely due to their being so supine and weak
 as to be unable to govern themselves.

<h> Same-sex "marriage" 

<p>There are very good reasons to strongly oppose same-sex "marriage"
 that have absolutely nothing to do with appeals to religion
 or morality, and even have nothing at all to do with gayness
 (which is why I call it "same-sex").

<p>
This is an important issue because it strikes at the very foundations
 of the most basic of human civilizational institutions, and
 is pertinent due to decreed legalization in Massachusetts, which
 will lead to possible national imposition via the "full faith
 and credit" clause of the Constitution -- all that will take
 is the whim of 5 unelected liberal Supreme Court justices.

<p>
The first objection is procedural. The second is on the substance
 (or lack thereof).

<p>
First, marriage cannot possibly be a Natural Right, since what
 they're really asking for is the benefits that come with it,
 which are, well benefits. And as such are rightfully the province
 of of the Legislature, not of the Courts. Otherwise we are ruled
 by an aristocracy.

<p>
I mean, what, is same-sex marriage more obviously an inherent
 Constitutional Right than, say, oh, woman having the vote?

<p>
That's a plainly stupid proposition and you all know it.

<p>
And yet, did the Suffragettes go and get a judge to declare
 women should have the Right to vote? No, they did not, because
 it was not Constitutionally obvious.

<p>
Instead, they did what the rules of our system dictated, and
 went out, and made their case, and got the XIXth Amendment passed.

<p>
And it was a long struggle, and they earned that Right.

<p>
And yet somehow it's clearer that marriage, the oldest human
 institution, that predates all known religions and even civilization
 itself, and was never ever anywhere in the world in any culture
 at any time ever applied to same-sex couples, is more fundamentally
 a Right than women having the vote.

<p>
Yeah. Sure. If I were a woman, I'd be outraged at the notion.

<p>
I'm outraged enough as it is!

<p>
I mean look, the whole thing has been turned on its head: instead
 of gays having to make the case why same-sex marriage is a great
 idea and trying to pass an Amendment to say so, we've been put
 in the position of having to pass an Amendment to squelch what
 should be an obvious absurdity. It is truly insane that this
 claim of an abridgement of an imaginary "right" is taken seriously
 for more than a nanosecond.

<p>
Now, our libertarian friends will claim that it's not government's
 business who gets married to whom, and shouldn't be up to government
 to decide who can and can't. Which is up to a point true: government
 (and society) really doesn't care who is shacking up with whom,
 as far as that goes. But it's a silly argument to make, when
 they then turn around and claim that then all of a sudden government
 should administer certain legal protections and benefits to
 the married couple!

<p>
Talk about wanting it both ways!

<p>
This also takes care of the "Equality" argument. The fact is,
 gays already have all the Equality they could possibly hope
 for when it comes to living their lives!

<p>
First of all, gays can get married -- to someone of the opposite
 sex, just like anyone else. And that's not a facetious argument.

<p>
Second, there's nothing stopping any of them from having a ceremony
 to declare their Lifepartnerhood with their beloved, and having
 all their friends and family applaud and recognize their love,
 and then living openly as a gay couple for the rest of their
 lives, especially with the Lawrence v. Texas decision which
 outlawed anti-sodomy laws.

<p>
From the libertarian point of view, then, gays have already
 achieved full equality and freedom in their relationships, without
 any government interference.

<p>
Nobody is stopping them. And if some church or whatever group
 wants to hold a ceremony, more power to them.

<p>
But when they then demand government step in and force everyone
 else in the country to not merely tolerate, but outright celebrate
 their union, and bestow it with a special set of benefits, it
 is completely disingenuous to not expect society (by way of
 government) to have any say in defining who can be married!

<p>
The point that is missed is that marriage is not merely about
 Lifepartnerhood.

<p>
If it were, then of course there could not be any objections
 to same-sex "marriage".

<p>
But marriage is specifically about, at its core, uniting the
 two different sexes of our species.

<p>
That's what it means.

<p>
That's what it's for.

<p>
That's always been its point.

<p>
Which gets to the substantive argument that same-sex "marriage"
 is a gargantuan oxymoron.

<p>
It's only because we've forgotten what marriage is about, in
 our modern world of abundance and leisure, that revolves around
 our self-gratification. Marriage has come to be seen merely
 as an expression of self-actualization, and perhaps a declaration
 of love for another individual.

<p>
And that's nice and all, but really, who cares?

<p>
I mean good for you if you found your Soulmate, but why does
 anyone expect the rest of us give a damn?

<p>
Why does that in itself justify any recognition or support from
 society?

<p>It doesn't.

<p>
People have become so accustomed to entitlements that they just
 assume for some reason that declaring "marriage" is somehow
 license to essentially open a big bridal registry to be satisfied
 from the public till.

<p>
They forget marriage is recognized and supported and subsidized
 by society because it serves a useful social purpose: bonding
 a male to a female.

<p>
And by definition, same-sex unions simply do not serve that
 social purpose!

<p>
Bonding a male to a female benefits society in two key ways.
 First, obviously the Tyranny of Testosterone dictates that it
 is males that cause almost all mischief, violence, and mayhem
 in society -- and especially "rogue", single males. But when
 bonded to a woman, this instinct is calmed.

<p>
That's just a fact. That's why, for instance, driver's insurance
 rates instantly drop for when when they tie the knot. It's in
 the cold, hard, actuarial tables that married men become safer,
 less aggressive drivers.

<p>
The female is clearly a civilizing influence on the male, when
 a relationship is committed to. And clearly, a same-sex union
 does not produce this effect.

<p>
The second key reason is of course the children that are expected
 to be produced. Even couples who do not intend to have children
 will always have the future option to. And a man-woman couple
 is better for raising children than a same-sex couple.

<p>
Yes, that's right! Now of course I'm not saing a gay person
 can't be a fine parent.

<p>
Don't put such a silly argument into my mouth, and simmer down,
 and listen to what I'm really saying, rather than having a hissy-fit.

<p>
I take it as given that a gay person can be just as good a parent
 -- no better, no worse -- than a heterosexual person.

<p>
But the average hetero couple will ALWAYS be FAR better than
 the average gay couple as parents.

<p>
Why? Because the hetero couple provides the child with both
 important psychological role models of a male father and a female
 mother.

<p>
Lacking either a mother or a father is a serious, serious blow
 to a child.

<p>
And a gay couple will always lack one of those!!!

<p>
There's no way around that fact.

<p>
We might wish it to be otherwise, but it's not.

<p>
The unpleasant truth is gay couples do their children a disservice.
 The child is in fact put in a terrible, untenable position of
 feeling like they should defend their gay parents out of loyalty,
 and yet knowing they were deliberately robbed of half their
 developmental experience.

<p>
And society should not celebrate that fact.

<p>
Sure, you can show me some anecdotal cases of outstanding gay
 couples raising children, and of poor hetero couples who are
 terrible as parents. So what? Public policy should never be
 driven by the exceptions!

<p>
There will be some overlap, but everyone must concede it's mathematically
 certain the average hetero couple will be better, because of
 the male-female synergy, unless you resort to claiming gays
 are somehow individually superior as parents. And thus the best
 will also be better than the best gay couples.

<p>
And that's even if they decide to have children, which most
 won't, which again points out the lack of a reason for society
 to recognize it. Social-policy and Law are meant for the general
 case; the exceptions -- in either direction -- are not relevant.

<p>
And now we see why the claim that opposing the "civil right"
 of gays to marry is the same as attempts to outlaw marriage
 between the races fails, because the male-female bond between
 different races is not diminished, and thus there's no good
 reason for banning such unions because they serve the same basic
 purpose for which marriage is intended -- which same-sex marriage
 does not.

<p>
It makes no sense for society to give the same recognition to
 different things that are of unequal utility. If we intend to
 do so merely out of magnanimity, the risk is great that marriage
 will be further weakend as its true reaons for existence get
 further and further ignored. It will indeed then be dumbed-down
 to mere Lifepartnerhood.

<p>
We've apparently already gone far in that direction; time to
 reverse course!

<p>
Look, it's like arguing that the numbers "1" and "2" should
 be equal. I mean, look, poor number 1 is always feeling overshadowed
 by 2. Wouldn't it be nice if they could be the same? Yeah, it
 would, but guess what, 1 does not equal 2, no matter how much
 we might wish it so.

<p>
And I repeat, nobody is stopping any gay couple from having
 a ceremony to declare their unending devotion! It's claiming
 their relationship has the same social utility, and hence status,
 as marriage that is absurd on its face.

<p>
All the relevant rights to live as they choose are already granted;
 remaining legal issues can be handled by private contracts.

<p>
The burden of proof, then, is on the gays to convince us of
 why their relationship should have special societal recognition,
 when weighed against the risks of weakening an institution that's
 already in decline. And that cannot be done.

<p>
The real reason people support gay marriage is merely to show
 how ostentatiously "tolerant" they are, which is nothing but
 Vanity.

<h> Woo-hoo, again! 

<p>
JERUSALEM - Israel's claim to have killed a Hamas leader in
 the Syrian capital on Sunday marked an escalation in the Jewish
 state's war against the violent group, embarrassed Syrian leaders
 and turned up pressure on Damascus to expel Palestinian militants.
 

<p>
The explosion in a Damascus suburb killed Izz Eldine Subhi Sheik
 Khalil, a leader of the Hamas military wing, in what was described
 by an Israeli commentator as an intricate operation in hostile
 territory and an example of Israel's long reach. 

<p>The breaking of the old "taboos" of sanctuaries for the mass-murdering
 enemies of civilization continues apace. These are fantastic
 developments. Half-measures only prolong conflicts.

<p>
Behold, Damascus will cease from being a city, And it will be
 a ruinous heap. --Isaiah 17:1

<h> Woo-hoo! 

<p>US President George W. Bush says "all options are on the table"
 for making sure Iran dismantles its nuclear program, and that
 Washington will never let Tehran acquire atomic weapons.

<p>Well now, that's pretty unequivocal, and the best news I've heard
 in a long time.

<p>
Why? The key to winning -- actually winning, as opposed to "managing"
 -- the War on Islamic Fascism, is eliminating the rogue states
 that provide sanctuary, support, and potentially -- and most
 dangerously for the continuance of Life as We Know It(tm) --
 nuclear weapons.

<p>
And such states are far easier to deal with if they lack nuclear
 weapons -- which is why our options are already limited in dealing
 with North Korea (thanks a lot, Jimmy and Madeline, you pathetic
 fools).

<p>
Without the support of these states -- and their number is dwindling
 -- social network theory is indicating that terrorist groups
 like al-Qaeda must necessarily fracture down to relatively manageable
 groups of 80-150 members at most, or else their security is
 blown.

<p>
Small groups like that cannot wage any kind of sustainable campaigns,
 and do indeed become mere law-enforcement issues.

<p>
But with the backing of a state, with diplomatic privileges,
 passports, and other resources, they can safely grow to larger
 sizes and become potentially unstoppable, undeterrable delivery
 vehicles for WMD, which threatens our very civilization.

<p>
And an Iranian nuclear capability would make destroying their
 evil theocracy infinitely harder.

<p>
Now we finally have a statement from the White House, that indicates
 they understand this.

<p>
This is the only issue that should matter in the next election,
 because all other issues depend, you know, on us being alive.

<p>
Or at least not under martial law.

<p>
And Kerry's position, stated on his website, is to give Iran
 nuclear fuel to help them along on their "peaceful" project...And
 if that fails, well, he'll try to get the IAEA to refer them
 to the hopelessly divided and ineffectual Security Council...

<p>
I'm sure that has them quaking in their boots!

<p>
The argument that he really doesn't mean that, and that cooler
 heads will prevail in the end, is ludicrous on two counts. First,
 nobody stopped a similarly ridiculous plan to "help" North Korea
 that way in the 90s. And second, the people making that argument
 are the very same ones who denigrate Bush as some kind of puppet
 that only does as he's told, as distinct from Kerry, who is
 ostensibly smarter and has real ideas...except when it comes
 to this idea, when Kerry is DEFENDED by arguing he's, well,
 nothing but a puppet who is going to do as he's told.

<h> Too Prescient 

<p>
Three-year-old Sophia Parlock cries while seated on the shoulders
 of her father, Phil Parlock, after having their Bush-Cheney
 sign torn up by Kerry-Edwards supporters on Thursday, Sept.
 16, 2004, at the Tri-State Airport in Huntington, W.Va. 

<p>Well isn't that special? Big Union fascist thug caught on film
 taunting a little girl to tears.

<p>
Michael Husar, 58, was arrested Friday after allegedly having
 an alcohol-induced bout of air rage aboard a Northwest Airlines
 flight to Anchorage, which was diverted to Winnipeg, Manitoba,
 because of the incident...Officials said Husar, a supporter
 of Sen. John Kerry, was engaged in a discussion on the upcoming
 presidential election with a woman seated next to him - a President
 George W. Bush supporter - when she became turned off by his
 belligerent attitude and complained to the flight staff...when
 flight attendants approached Husar, he became enraged... 

<p>And add to that obviously forged documents, conclusively proven
 as frauds, that continue to be peddled by CBS, mouthpiece of
 the DNC.

<p>
They're starting to lose it. It will only get worse.

<p>
Violently stifling dissent has always been the hallmark of the
 despot.

<h> The War That Dare Not Speak Its Name 

<p>
MOSCOW - Russian police investigating the deadly Beslan school
 siege are looking inside their own squad house: One of the attack
 organizers was allegedly a former cop who disappeared six years
 ago.

<p>And of course the first thing that popped into my head is, "and
 let me guess, he's a religiously-motivated Muslim?"

<p>
The article goes on to list some possible motivations:

<p>
Police have been implicated in kidnappings for ransom and accused
 of allowing Chechen rebels free passage through checkpoints
 — motivated by either money, sympathy for the fighters' cause
 or family ties, or a combination of all three.

<p>Well, ok. Then about 5 paragraphs later, we find

<p>
Taziyev, a Muslim, is accused of becoming an adherent of the
 extreme Wahhabi sect of Islam — the same as al-Qaida leader
 Osama bin Laden

<p>What a surprise.

<p>
The bland phrase "sympathy for the fighters' cause" (notice
 the neutral "fighter", for which your mind is supposed to supply
 the understood modifier "freedom") masks the fact that Orthodox
 Christians were singled out as victims, and simply for inflicting
 punishment on them rather than for any political demands.

<p>
We may abhor the idea -- indeed, even run from it -- but the
 unpleasant fact is, Islam is waging a religious war on non-Muslims.

<p>
The Koran is as much analagous to Machiavelli's Art of Waras
 a manual for conquest and subjugation as it is to the Bible,
 if not more so.

<h> Political Party Prediction 

<p>Prediction: The Democrat party is going to split.

<p>
By not giving official recognition to party politics in the
 Constitution, the natural result is for two major camps to emerge,
 each forced to collect as large a body of interest groups as
 possible into a mega-coalition. This scramble to capture the
 middle generally keeps both sides of roughly equal strength,
 and produces what appears to be only bland differences in practice
 between the parties -- a trait which many bemoan.

<p>
The upside is that it is thus the "majority of the middle" that
 gets represented, which really is as it ought to be -- most
 of the time.

<p>
And luckily, our system has built into it plenty of protections
 that temper this "tyranny of the majority", but the majority
 should be generally in charge, after all. Proportional-representation
 Parliamentary systems, on the other hand, allow minor extremist
 parties to sometimes wield disproportianate power by creating
 ruling coalitions, leading to a "tyranny of the minority" which
 is more toxic.

<p>
But looking at our nation's political history, it hasn't always
 been just Democrats and Republicans. Instead, what one finds
 that a kind of Darwinian evolution by recombination occurs.

<p>
What happens historically is that at times of national crisis
 or great change, such as around the Civil War, numerous competing
 parties emerge, which destroy the coalitions of the then-prevailing
 two major parties.

<p>
Anyone remember the Whigs, the Know-Nothings, the Free Soilers?
 Or the Bull Moose Progressives?

<p>
The new parties and interest groups then all jockey for position
 and, in a kind of game of political musical chairs, eventually
 settle down into two NEW major opposing parties. Sometimes the
 names of the old parties are maintained, but the interests they
 represent are forever changed.

<p>
Voices that once were in the background may come to the fore
 in the new coalition, and others sometimes get left out entirely
 and fade away.

<p>
And this is going to happen very soon to the current Democrats.
 Their New Deal generation is gone, along with the manufacturing
 jobs and their big unions.

<p>
I originally thought they might break up in 1992, when they
 appeared at first in disarray, unable to find a big name to
 oppose a then-popular Bush I, and facing a wildly popular independent,
 Ross Perot. It seemed to me then that if Perot were to make
 bold moves, he could have shattered the Democrats and seized
 the Presidency, forming a new, viable Reform party.

<p>
But inexperienced politically and thin-skinned, he dropped out
 of the race in the Summer, then rejoined belatedly in the Fall.
 This indecisiveness ruined his chances, though he still got
 19% of the vote -- an amazing show for a half-hearted third-party
 candidacy!

<p>
(And good thing for us he lost! As I've always said, an efficient
 businesslike government -- which Perot promised -- is exactly
 what we DON'T need, because that just makes government better
 at taking your money and your Rights!)

<p>
So a charismatic Bill Clinton and a revived economy papered
 over deep problems within the Democrat party.

<p>
But now we find, on the Great Question of the Day -- Are we
 in a real War or not? -- that just over half the Democratic
 base believes strongly the answer is NO but the rest strongly
 think it is YES.

<p>
That's an untenable situation, and is why Kerry must take both
 sides. If he comes out definitively either way, he loses half
 his base.

<p>
For the Republicans, it's probably something like 80% think
 YES and the rest are isolationist "paleoconservatives" who grumble
 but have nowhere else to go.

<p>
So my wild predictions are as follows: Kerry candidacy implodes,
 Democrats are furious and seething; and amid recriminations
 and finger-pointing, the Dean wing splits off, and unites with
 the Greens and other anti-war, anti-capitalist, anti-globalist,
 anti-American elements, and forms a far-left party backed by
 Soros money. This party probably takes a new name. 

<p>
The Democrat rump of the party is seized by elements that are
 more realist and pragmatic, and field Hillary in 2008 -- who,
 in an attempt to grab more of the center, runs with Republican-in-name-only
 John McCain! McCain's popularity among moderate Republicans
 pulls off some Republicans into the New Democrats, especially
 among the working-class populists and maybe even the isolationists.

<p>
The New Republicans counter with a Giuliani-Rice ticket!

<p>
These New Republicans will consist of "neoconservatives" and
 fugitive Reagan/Zell Miller Democrats.

<p>
The Deaniac-Naderites easily siphon off enough votes to sink
 Hillary-McCain, and leftist political violence rises as they
 fade, screaming, into oblivion.

<p>
And the role-reversal will be complete: the New Republicans
 will be much like old-style Liberals, and the New Democrats
 will be the big-government reactionaries!

<h> Health Care 

<p>Canada's once-proud public health system in crisis
OTTAWA, Sept
 14 (Reuters) - Canada often boasts its universal health care
 program shows it is more caring than the United States, but
 the system is creaking alarmingly, with long wait lists for
 treatment, and shortages of cash and doctors.

<p>
And far from criticizing the United States, some people are
 choosing to go south of the border to pay for operations in
 private hospitals -- institutions that are forbidden in Canada
 by the law that set up the publicly funded system.

<p>
...waiting time for treatment in 2003 rose to 17.7 weeks from
 16.5 weeks in 2002. "This grim portrait is the legacy of a medical
 system offering low expectations cloaked in lofty rhetoric,"
 the study said, criticizing the fact that governments and not
 doctors are responsible for allocating resources. Some delays
 are much longer. Patients in Ontario who require major knee
 surgery can wait six months to see a specialist and then another
 18 months for surgery.

<p> What's the answer? Who knows?

<p>
Clearly, on the one hand, price controls imposed by a governmental
 system sap innovation and lead to rationing of scarce resources.

<p>
But on the other hand, guaranteed payments in a free-market
 will lead to prices rising without bound.

<p>
Perhaps the goal should be just for truly catastrophic coverage.
 But mission creep will surely set in. Next, people will say
 we'd save more (Aha! Once the public gets involved, it becomes
 about costs!) to add on preventative medicine coverage. But
 then we'd surely get busy-bodies saying, well, if we're going
 to all be paying for someone else's poor health decisions, shouldn't
 we be able to require that people eat the way we want them to
 eat, and exercise the way we demand they exercise?

<p>
It immediately becomes about control.

<p>Lawsuits against fast food companies have already begun. The
 House has passed (over Democrat objections) a bill to squelch
 such frivolous suits, but the Senate has not yet taken it up.

<p>
I don't want to be taxed for not having an acceptable Body Mass
 Index!

<h> Continuity of Government 

<p>Given that we're not actually on a war footing as a society,
 I often hear people wonder what they could or should be doing.

<p>
At the least, there is no excuse for us to not all do our part
 to ensure the continuity of government.

<p>
Imagine an attack that takes out half of Congress. Paralysis
 and confusion would reign:

<p>
An attack on the U.S. Capitol not only could have destroyed
 a powerful landmark but also would likely have put our national
 government in jeopardy. “At a time when we would need a Congress
 most—a time of war—we could have been without a Congress,”
 says Norman Ornstein, a government scholar at the American Enterprise
 Institute (AEI).

<p>
How could that happen? Because 1) Congress has very specific
 rules covering how it can meet, including requiring a majority
 of members to be present for a quorum. And 2) when there is
 a vacancy in the House, it can only be filled by a special election,
 which takes about four months. There is no provision in either
 the House or Senate to deal with a situation in which numerous
 members might be incapacitated [from a chemical of biological
 attack that doesn't actually kill them outright!].

<p>But ensuring that such continuity will automatically take place
 may even take away the incentive to try to decapitate the government
 in the first place!

<p>
Furthermore, it is vitally important for maintaining public
 confidence in the legitimacy of the process by having a Constitutional
 mechanism already in place, rather than making it up on the
 fly.

<p>
This state of affairs is untenable and irresponsible. We must
 plan for the worst.

<p>
Then contact your Senators and Representatives and ask them
 their positions on this and ask them why nothing is being done.

<p>
What it comes down to is whether vacancies will be filled by
 temporary governor appointment, or from a list made by the politicians
 themselves. The former has the advantage of being straightforward
 and sure to work in a practical manner. The latter latter has
 the advantage of being nominally more in line with the "will
 of the people", on the assumption that those chosen by the politicians
 will be of a similar ideology, which was apparently desired
 by the voters. But we may find such lists to not be kept up
 to date, or might lead to unforseen consequences of gamesmanship,
 patronage, or corruption.

<p>
It makes good sense certainly for governors to appoint Senators
 (as they represent the State as a whole), but yes, it's not
 exactly in the intended spirit to have such appointments of
 Representatives. On the other hand, the appointments are temporary
 just until emergency elections can be organized. My opinion
 therefore is that the appointment route is the most robustly
 workable.

<h> The Loyal Opposition 

<p>There's a very popular website for leftists called the Democratic
 Underground.

<p>
I just thought it would be instructive to view this thread of
 discussion they're having, including all the replies of rousing
 agreement and elaboration. Some excerpts:

<p>To the citizens of Dirtsville USA: Quit grieving for NYC...
Since
 tomorrow is the anniversary of the "excuse" the cowboy uses
 to attack anybody he wants to. You never liked New Yorkers.
 You hated New Yorkers remember. If you really cared about the
 victims of 9/11 you would vote for John Kerry because that's
 the only thing they want you to do....
So take your flags, your
 prayers, your rodeos and your country music and stick it. You're
 waging war because you want too, because you like it and you're
 not fooling anybody. You're only happy when you have an enemy,
 if it wasn't 9/11 it would be something else. Like "libruls".
 At least have the decency to admit that.

<p>These elites consider themselves oh so superiour to the rubes
 in flyover dirtsville country; and oh so more intellectual and
 cultured and educated.

<p>
I also wish to point out their discussion policy, which is straight
 out of Animal Farm...or worse:

<p>WHO IS WELCOME ON DEMOCRATIC UNDERGROUND, AND WHO IS NOT
We welcome
 Democrats of all stripes, along with other progressives who
 will work with us to achieve our shared goals.
This is a "big
 tent" message board. We welcome a wide range of progressive
 opinion. You will likely encounter many points of view here
 that you disagree with.We ban conservative disruptors who are
 opposed to the broad goals of this website. If you think overall
 that George W. Bush is doing a swell job, or if you wish to
 see Republicans win, or if you are generally supportive of conservative
 ideals, please do not register to post, as you will likely be
 banned.

<p>In other words, it is nothing but a giant echo chamber, enforced
 with an iron fist. Certain points of view are dismissed out
 of hand. Anything but complete conformity is banned outright.
 That's no way to further the cause of honest inquiry, now, is
 it?

<h> My Scrapbook 

<p>
Three years ago today, this pair set out to destroy us. They
 forced innocent people to make this horrific choice. They believe
 this, and want to impose the Shariah lifestyle where women know
 their place.

<p>
When we mourned, others celebrated and cheered, despite the
 irony. Witness this cute toy popular in Gaza. Note the fine
 attention to detail around the bases of the towers, recalling
 these people. And this toy. And this one. (Thanks, China...)

<p>
But some in this country would rather he were still in power,
 and wish terrorists to be avenged. Just don't question their
 patriotism, even when groups like ANSWER openly advocate murder
 and mutiny, and wish the terrorists will win.

<h> Third Anniversary 

<p>Perhaps by design, perhaps by Fate, I just received (after waiting
 months? a year?) the free DVD Up From Zero from the Department
 of Labor, a documentary about the workers at Ground Zero, just
 in time for the third anniversary.

<p>
Unfortunately, it seems this offer may be over; I can't find
 any mention of if at their website anymore.

<p>
At this time I would like to recall one of the strangest of
 the many "you can't make this up" rescue stories from that terrible
 time. If the Hand of Providence is ever to be detected in the
 Affairs of Men, it is in events such as this. An excerpt:

<p>
Two of the last three to be located and saved were Port Authority
 police officers. They were not discovered by a heroic firefighter,
 or a rescue worker, or a cop. They were discovered by Dave Karnes.
 

<p>Karnes hadn't been near the World Trade Center. He wasn't even
 in New York when the planes hit the towers. He was in Wilton,
 Conn., working in his job as a senior accountant with Deloitte
 &amp; Touche. When the second plane hit, Karnes told his colleagues,
 "We're at war." He had spent 23 years in the Marine Corps infantry
 and felt it was his duty to help. Karnes told his boss he might
 not see him for a while.

<h> Credit Where Due 

<p>Did I shift into an alternate reality? Not only did the blogosphere
 seem to have taken down Dan Rather in 24 hours, but now Reuters
 issues a starkly truthful headline:

<p>Iran Seen Using EU to Buy Time to Get Atomic Bomb

<p>
Vienna diplomats say the EU three oppose a U.N. Security Council
 report next week. Diplomats and intelligence officials say this
 may give Iran just enough time to reach the point where it has
 all the technology and expertise it needs to develop an atom
 bomb at a time of its choosing.

<p>Guess they finally looked into the abyss. Wonder if Beslan had
 anything to do with this stunning change in outlook.

<h> Diversity vs Assimilation 

<p>There's a wildly popular Canadian commercial for Molson Beer,
 known as "Joe's Rant". In it, the eponymous Joe rants about
 what he does and does not stand for as a proud Canadian, by
 drawing clear distinctions with American values.

<p>
The most interesting lines, being the mantra of the leftist
 transnational progressives, are

<p>
I believe in peace keeping, not policing;
diversity, not assimilation...

<p>Well good for you!

<p>
I was stunned to see lack of assimilation seen as a positive!
 I mean, that's just incredible! And make no mistake, the ideal
 of the American "Melting Pot" was to assimilate newcomers into
 WASP culture (open to all), while maintaining pride in (but
 not slavish devotion to) ethnic heritage.

<p>
What happens when immigrants don't assimilate? And force the
 host nation to accomodate to its foreign, possibly incompatible
 values?

<p>
The police now publicly admit what many Scandinavians have known
 for a long time: They no longer control the situation in the
 nations's third largest city. It is effectively ruled by violent
 gangs of Muslim immigrants. Some of the Muslims have lived in
 the area of Rosengård, Malmø, for twenty years, and still
 don't know how to read or write Swedish. Ambulance personnel
 are attacked by stones or weapons, and refuse to help anybody
 in the area without police escort.
***
Swedes, who a couple
 of decades ago decided to open the doors to Muslim "refugees"
 and asylum seekers, are now turned into refugees in their own
 country and forced to flee their homes. The people abandoning
 the city mention crime and fear of the safety of their children
 as the main reason for leaving.
***
ALL of the 600 windows at
 one of the schools in Malmø have been broken during the summer
 holiday. Window smashing alone costs the city millions every
 year. City buses have been forced to avoid the immigrant ghetto,
 as they are met with youths throwing rocks or bottles at them
 if they enter.
***
Rapes in Sweden as a whole have increased
 by 17% just since the beginning of 2003, and have had a dramatic
 increase during the past decade. Gang rapes, usually involving
 Muslim immigrant males and native Swedish girls, have become
 commonplace. Two weeks ago, 5 Kurds brutally raped a 13-year-old
 Swedish girl.
***
Yesterday a taxi firm in Odense announced
 they had taken the decision not to carry Somalian passengers
 due to a number of attacks by young Somalians on taxi drivers.

<p>Surely, immigrants are needed in the West for growth, but they
 must be assimilated. (Classical historian Victor Davis Hanson
 discusses a similar problem we face here, in his book Mexifornia).

<p>
The doctrine of multiculturalism, however, has served only to
 assault our confidence in Western Judeo-Christian civilization,
 rendering us unable to insist that the newcomers conform, so
 as not to appear to imply -- horrors! -- that our culture might
 be better (disagree? Two words: Individual Rights).

<p>Multiculturalist doctrine is based on the false equation that
 race = culture. Given that mistake, it then seems to follow
 that denial of cultural equality equals racism. But it doesn't.

<p>
The revisionism that suggests Columbus Day, Thanksgiving, or
 even the Fourth of July should not be celebrated but mourned,
 is part of this effort. Offhand comments by Dr. Rice are the
 result of this brainwashing.

<p>
But multiculturalism, which has already made such thorough inroads
 that there's no stopping it, will lead only to the extinction
 of Western identity.

<p>
Which, out of self-loathing for imagined sins of the past, is
 exactly what many Leftists long for.

<h> Memogate 

<p>Is the media finally having its own Watergate moment?

<p>
CBS, on its flagship "60 Minutes" "news" show, was touting newly
 found "memos" purportedly from the posthumous papers of a commander
 of Bush's in the National Guard in 1973, indicating pressure
 from above to ease him through the system or something.

<p>
Well it seems the fact-checking abilities of the blogosphere
 were gravely underestimated. All indications so far are that
 the documents are obvious forgeries! Updates are here.

<p>
Some of the documents have all the hallmarks of being made by
 MS Word, rather than on a typewriter as would have existed in
 1973...

<p>
Some VERY suspicious items:
*proportional Times New Roman font
 (instead of a monotype font)
*kerning of letters (adjusting
 the spacing for various combinations)
*curly "smart quotes"
 instead of straight ones
*line breaks that mimic MS-Word auto-wordwrap
 algorithms exactly
*an auto-superscript of a tiny "th"-symbol
 (as in "187th")
*many other items too, such as odd diction,
 but the above are definite relics of the computer age: some
 have been able to exactly overlay an MS-Word generated document
 using default settings in 12-point Times New Roman with the
 CBS documents -- no way those came from 1973!

<p>
Imagine that, caught by the annoying "Autoformat" feature!

<p>
I knew my moral support of Microsoft was not in vain! :-)

<p>
The media has become arrogant ever since Watergate, seeing themselves
 almost as another branch of government. There has been too much
 outright fabrication, such as the cases of Jayson Blair and
 others. And now CBS was so partisan, wanting these documents
 to be true, that they didn't do the simplest checking of their
 sources.

<p>
Their function as impartial judges of information has been squandered.

<p>
The internet is rendering their control of information obsolete.

<p>
How will 60 Minutes and Dan Rather respond?

<p>
Even if the documents are true, it's a tempest in a teapot.
 Bush, unlike Kerry, was never running on his military service
 record, nor built his political career on it. And the irresponsibility
 of a young Bush is already part of his "story" that we all know,
 so such revelations would even come as no surprise and have
 no meaning.

<h> Breslan Fallout? 

<p>
In new signs that U.S. complaints about Iran may be having an
 impact, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Wednesday called
 Tehran's nuclear activities "extremely alarming" and Russia
 reported new delays in construction of an Iranian nuclear facility
 at Bushehr.

<h> The Big Picture 

<p>Given all the noise, sniping, and dishonest reporting, it's useful
 to step back and look at the big strategic picture. We need
 context: where are we, how did we get here, and where are we
 going?

<p>
Just what in the world is going on?

<p>
I will collect here some cogent background articles written
 by others that will tell you all you need to know.

<p>
[UPDATE: The keen observations of John Quincy Adams and Winston
 Churchill on Islam are also relevant and timely.]

<p>
1. A bullet-form outline of the root causes of Arab terrorism,
 and why taking down Iraq makes sense, is here. This is the BIG
 PICTURE.

<p>
(It includes many sublinks, some of the most important that
 I would have listed as "required reading" in their own right
 being the links on transnational progressivism, the Jacksonian
 tradition, and the causes of Arab civilizational failure. Come
 back and read those later.)

<p>
2. A brilliant strategic picture of the world, "The Pentagon's
 New Map", by a professor at the U.S. Navy War College, explains
 "why we're going to war, and why we'll keep going to war." That
 article later became a book. I saw Dr. Barnett give a briefing
 on CSPAN over the weekend, and found his views very provocative.

<p>
(About 2 years ago I wrote a letter to Rumsfeld strongly suggesting
 the development of special administrative/peacekeeping/humanitarian
 brigades, to relieve the warriors from those inevitable duties.
 He didn't write back, of course...But I'm pleased to see that
 this guy, who has his ear, is basically saying the same thing!)

<p>
3. Here is an essay that sums up the situation and outlines
 one possible very dark future, which underlines why it is so
 vitally important to win this war decisively by conventional
 means as soon as possible.

<p>
4. Just what DO the Islamic terrorists want, anyway? Here is
 an overview of al-Qaeda's deadly fantasy ideology.

<p>
5. And this long reflection which appeared in the New Yorker,
 after several paragraphs of introduction, outlines the deep
 philosophical roots of the movement, based on the writings of
 Sayyid Qutb in the mid-20th century. His books are al-Qaeda's
 "Mein Kampf".

<p>
In brief, this philosophy is a total rejection of human worldliness
 as sinful -- which justifies any atrocity in the name of Allah:

<p>
In his Koranic commentary, "In the Shade of the Qur'an," Qutb
 suggested that the believer's brief sojourn on earth should
 be spent "purifying the filthy marsh of this world." Rich, sexy,
 Truman-era America gave him a taste of this world at its filthiest
 and marshiest.

<p>And in Qutb's own words,

<p>
There is only one place on earth which can be called the house
 of Islam, and it is that place where an Islamic state is established
 and the Shari'ah is the authority and God's laws are observed.
 . . . The rest of the world is the house of war.

<h> Media Ghouls 

<p>I intended to write an essay about the "grim milestone", as the
 Media Ghouls would promote it, of the 1,000th combat death in
 Iraq. This portrayal has no purpose but to damage our morale
 and sap our will, so I won't even link to the headline.

<p>
Enemy propagandists could not do better if they tried. "Lord
 Haw-Haw", alias William Joyce, believed WW2 to be a pointless
 unnecessary war instigated by Jews and International Bankers.

<p>
All he did was broadcast demoralizing propaganda into Britain.

<p>And he was executed as a traitor at Nuremburg in 1946.

<p>
They had more moral clarity back then. They were less interested
 in scoring cheap political points -- treating the issue as a
 big game -- and more interested in winning for the broader goal
 of bequeathing the benefits of our free, prosperous society
 to future generations.

<p>
However, I discovered an essay on this topic had already been
 written, that even used my intended title!

<h> Whitewash 

<p>The news out of Beslan just gets worse and worse, if that was
 even possible. Not a mere "hostage-taking", we find that in
 this carefully-planned, calculated, and prepared-for operation,
 that the children -- by design, the children! -- were systematically
 tortured, gratuitously terrorized, and much worse that I can't
 even describe,

<p>for the sheer pleasure of it.

<p>
We must realize that these Islamic terrorists have no real demands
 and simply wish to stage a spectacle of slow-motion mass death,
 culminating in their "martyrdom." Therefore, any "hostages"
 should consider themselves already dead and react accordingly
 -- and "negotiators" must stand aside, with assault troops ordered
 in immediately before they can entrench themselves.

<p>
For a tale of heroism in the school, see here. Local updates
 are here.

<p>
What is most incredible is the media whitewash of this atrocity.
 Most use the bland euphemism "Chechen separatist", not telling
 you that Chechnya already has a degree of autonomy and the "separatists"
 aren't struggling for freedom from Russian tyrrany, but rather
 for the freedom to impose Sharia and create and Islamic state,
 ala the Taliban.

<p>
Chechnya is the front line in al-Qaeda's plans to resurrect
 the Islamic Caliphate; has been for years. This is not some
 local squabble in a far-away place, but an integral part of
 the world-wide Islamc jihad movement, and such an operation
 to murder non-Muslim children is part of their play-book and
 can be sprung anywhere, even here.

<p>
This was a professional al-Qaeda operation, complete with a
 squad of Arab "holy warriors".

<p>
But make this connection? Identify these murderers as terrorists,
 let alone Islamic ones? No. As Daniel Pipes (of the Presidential
 Institute of Peace) points out, the press has been using terms
 such as "captors", "commandos", "group", "hostage-takers", and
 "activists", among many others.

<p>
weepy candlelight vigils were a cop-out: the issue wasn't whether
 you were sad about the dead people but whether you wanted to
 do something about it. Three years on, that's still the difference.
 We can all get upset about dead children, but unless you're
 giving honest thought to what was responsible for the slaughter
 your tasteful elegies are no use. Nor are the hyper-rationalist
 theories about "asymmetrical warfare".

<p>Thus this story about demonstrations in Russia makes Steyn's
 point, stating

<p>
But while the emotion was genuine, the officially-approved rally
 was also brief and felt choreographed, prompting unfavourable
 comparisons with the uninhibited outpouring of grief seen in
 Spain after the March 11 attacks.

<p>That's because the Russian demonstrations aren't meant as a signal
 of appeasement and surrender, as they were in Spain, with all
 the absurd "PACE" flags and "No to Terror" statements with nothing
 to back them up. Rather than staging feel-good grief rallies,
 the Russians were drawing parallels with 1945 and pledging Victory.

<p>
The Russians are worrying more about what they're going to do
 about it than about putting on a parade.

<h> Another 6 Minutes 

<p>Man does not live by red-meat right-wing politics alone!

<p>
From time to time I will recount the lighter side of dating
 as a single 30-something.

<p>
One service I use caters to graduates of Ivy and similar schools.
 After viewing a short advertisement and possibly a picture,
 for a small fee one can then order a more in-depth biography
 along with contact information.

<p>
One of the questions on the long bio asks about one's "Social-political
 views".

<p>
Oh boy... (!)

<p>
The odd thing is apparently Ivy-league women are surprisingly
 left-wing. Far left wing.

<p>Or at least, the ones who are still single into their thirties
 are...

<p>
At least 90% of them write something like "Progressive", "Liberal",
 or, shockingly, "Progressively Liberal", and usually add the
 friendly codicil, "and it's important to me that my partner
 is as well!"

<p>
So clearly one can see my problem, given that my bio there looks
 much like my description on my profile here.

<p>
Well lately, I just wasted another $12.90 on 4 more bios.

<p>
Even given the answers from before, nothing prepared me for
 what I was about to see.

<p>
One had answered

<p>
Social-Political Views:I grew up at a Socialist summer camp.
 Very liberal. Very.

<p>Ok....

<p>
Socialist Summer Camp?!? What do they do there, make leather
 covers for Mao's Little Red Book?

<p>
And then this: "I am open to most backgrounds...conservatives
 need not apply."

<p>
Now what was that about open minded-ness again?

<p>
Here, I'll save you $100,000 on tuition, room and board: just
 take a big nail and drive it up your nose for a frontal lobotomy.

<p>Same end result at a cost of about 10 cents.

<p>
Another system I've tried several times is "pre-dating", in
 which you meet a new person every 6 minutes, then fill out a
 card saying who you'd like to meet again, and if both people
 match you both get the contact information the next day.

<p>
It's pretty fun actually.

<p>
But I still haven't made any matches.

<p>
Gee, I wonder why? :-)

<p>
The topic of movies came up (like it always does), and when
 asked what I've seen recently, well, I had been watching some
 weird, silly Vincent Price & Peter Lorre movies like The Raven.

<p>
Bad choice to discuss!

<p>
You know you're digging a hole when you find yourself having
 to explain who Vincent Price is: "you know the guy in Edward
 Scissorhands? No, not Johnny Depp, the old one! Uh..."

<p>
On the other hand, I'd know I had a match made in heaven if
 she had responded, "Why yes, I LOVED him in The Conqueror Worm!"
 And then we'd quote in unison, "You took him from me! YOU TOOK
 HIM FROM ME!!" (I don't really enjoy this movie but the finale
 is effective).

<p>
Ok, that's not gonna happen in a million years.

<p>
But at least I had enought sense not to talk about Dario Argento's
 horror-thriller Phenomena, which features the mutated homicidal
 progeny of the criminally insane, a domesticated razor-wielding
 chimp, and a heroine (a 15 year-old Jennifer Connelly) with
 a strange psychic rapport with insects...

<p>
When several of the young women had mentioned they had also
 tried 8-minute dating (apparently there's a version of this
 concept for every minute from 5 to 8), I would quip, "oh, is
 it 33% better than 6-minute dating?"

<p>
That tended to produce blank stares.

<p>
I also didn't do myself any favors when, told by one that she
 had cried during the three-hanky chick-flick The Notebook, I
 responded "Oh, I also cried, during Spider Man 2!"

<p>
Survey says........BUZZZZ!!!

<p>
Well, I thought it was funny...

<p>
The last chick I met that night, an asian, was radiating a serious
 'tude. As I sat down she sneered in a combination of boredom
 and contempt and opened with, "I'm a doctor; what do you do?"

<p>
I thought to inject a note of levity: "I'm a physicist. So I'm
 a doctor too -- but not a real one."

<h> Kerry Strikes Back 

<p>Well, Senator, what do you have to say about recent events in
 the world?

<p>Kerry questioned the timing of the Bush administration's announcement
 late on Friday that older Americans will have to pay about 17
 percent more next year for their government-run health insurance.

<p>
"He promised again a couple of nights ago to strengthen Medicare,"
 Kerry told a rally at a baseball stadium in Akron. "Then you
 wake up when a lot of the news is being hidden by what's happening
 in the hurricane down in Florida, what's happening in Russia
 with 200 people tragically killed by terrorists." 

<p>It's all about you, isn't it, Senator? You only see the "tragedy"
 through the lens of how it impacts your political message getting
 precious airtime, don't you?

<p>[NOTE: this post was originally published 9/4/2004. I was responding
 to a comment on 9/6/2004 and ended up posting a draft I was
 not happy with. I could not figure out how to delete or edit
 my reply, so instead republished the entire entry from scratch,
 comments and all.]

<h> Reuters Watch 

<p>The U.K.-based Reuters news agency, over 150 years old, would
 have you believe it's the world's premiere wire service.

<p>
But not only is it biased, it's objectively on the other side.

<p>
Consider this interesting item taken from its very own website,
 in recounting its corporate history. It proudly states:

<p>
During both World Wars, Reuters came under pressure from the
 British government to serve British interests. In 1941 Reuters
 deflected this pressure by restructuring itself as a private
 company. 

<p>Well good for you, Reuters! Wouldn't want to serve those horrible,
 despicable "British interests" when Civilization hung in the
 balance against the onslaught of murderous Nazi hordes now,
 would you? Could being founded by a German have anything to
 do with that policy through both World Wars?

<p>
This position is defended as maintaining journalistic independence
 and integrity:

<p>
The Trust preserves Reuters independence and neutrality. The
 principles of the Trust were maintained and the power to enforce
 them was strengthened when Reuters became a public company in
 1984.

<p>As if neutrality in the face of pure Evil were a Virtue!

<p>
Would that they actually were neutral, though that would be
 bad enough.

<p>
This is just a smokescreen. Note that in the recent horrific
 attacks on innocent children in Russia, Reuters would only refer
 to the Islamic terrorists as an "armed gang", even stating hours
 after the attack that "it remained unclear who the attackers
 were."

<p>
The religious angle was not even mentioned, because clearly,
 that could not possibly have any bearing whatsoever on anything,
 could it?

<p>
Because to discuss such things might offend someone.

<p>Because it might hurt someone's little feelings.

<p>
Oh, they are the very models of professionalism and restraint
 at Reuters!

<p>
Even though the attackers had already been said to be speaking
 Arabic, such mere hearsay could not be reported until, apparently,
 verified in person on the scene.

<p>
It couldn't even be spoken of as "reportedly."

<p>
No, nothing but pure, cold, hard facts for Reuters! No subjectivism
 such as using the word "terrorist" is tolerated by editorial
 policy, unless someone else said it, in which case it is placed
 in "scare quotes" as if to mock to concept or to distance one's
 self from it.

<p>
One wonders, with that kind of rigor, how they can bring themselves
 to report anything at all.

<p>
And yet... And yet...

<p>
When it comes to reporting from Gaza or Iraq, the basest hear-say
 and grossest editorializing is palmed off as actual objective
 reporting by non-neutral Arab stringers!

<p>
Is this a news story, or a fauning PR release for Hamas, dripping
 with glee over the blood of the innocent?

<p>Hamas Militants Rebound Despite Israeli Blows
GAZA (Reuters)
 - With two human bombs from the West Bank, the Palestinian militant
 group Hamas has shown that Israel’s campaign to kill off its
 leadership hasnot broken its will or wherewithal to shed Israeli
 blood...the simultaneous suicide attacks on two buses that killed
 16 people in the Israeli city of Beersheba on Tuesday dashed
 speculation that Hamas had lost the ability to strike in Israel,
 although their resolve was generally not in doubt. The Beersheba
 bombings shattered a nearly six-month lull in suicide attacks
 that had Israelis daring to think it was pretty safe to go about
 their lives once again as normal.

<p>
Yes, how dare they think it was "pretty safe", those subhuman
 Jews! The sheer impudence of them!

<p>
seven are in another building being pounded by tanks and the
 rest are fleeing through the countryside pursued by local citizens
 with deer rifles.
**EDIT**
its now been reported that the ones
 who tried to flee across country (now numbered at 13) are holed
 up in a house, surrounded by local civilians who are shooting
 the place apart, brick by brick.

<p>
The best-selling deer rifle in Russia is the Tigr, a civilianized
 version of the Dragunov SVD. Its wickedly accurate.

<p>This is the militia in action.

<p>
It no longer seems to be right-wing paranoid fantasies that
 dozens of armed Islamic terrorists might rampage through some
 small, remote town here now, does it? It would be easy for them
 to arrange to ambush and neutralize the local police and block
 off the area for quite enough time to slaughter your children.

<p>
This is what they wish to do, proven by both word and deed.

<p>
The only defense is you, the armed citizen.

<p>The militia.

<p>
Patrick Henry observed that

<p>
The militia, sir, is our ultimate safety. We can have no security
 without it... The great object is, that every man be armed.

<p>Free men, sovereigns unto themselves, are armed; slaves are not.

<p>
How to proceed in this modern era? Congress has not followed
 George Washington's wishes to provide for equipping and regularly
 training the militia.

<p>
Or has it? At least, in accordance with its power to equip the
 militia, it has established the Civilian Marksmanship Program
 to supply surplus WW2/Korean War-era M1 Garand semi-automatic
 battle rifles to qualified members of the public.

<p>
That's right, for the bargain price of $300-$400 (probably 1/4
 retail!), the FedEx man will deliver this venerable arm, called
 "the greatest battle implement ever devised" by General Patton,
 right to your door!

<p>
All I had to do was join the state shooting organization for
 about $30 (or one can join an actual local shooting club, but
 that often takes time, connections, and more money), and then
 went to a standard clinic hosted by a CMP-participating club
 for the cost of $15, which bought me 50 rounds of ammo, a loaned
 rifle, and some basic instruction.

<p>
I then spent some time shooting from standard match positions
 -- standing, prone, sitting, rapid, slow -- but no minimum score
 is required, just get the 50 rounds down range to get your certificate
 to complete your application!

<p>
After a few hours on a hot summer day, I was thirsty, tired,
 burned, and bruised from the recoil. It was great.

<p>
A few weeks later I got my M1. According to the serial numbers,
 it seems to be a late 1945 model, rebuilt in the early 1950s.

<h> Militia 

<p>
How often have we heard that refrain from those opposed individual
 firearms ownership when dismissing the 2nd Amendment?

<p>
And you know what? That's true. The 2nd Amendment is about the
 militia.

<p>
But you also know what?

<p>
The militia is YOU!

<p>
A militia, properly understood, is nothing other than the body
 of armed citizens.

<p>
Just as urbanites have lost touch with the realities of the
 farm, so too have moderns lost touch with the civic realities
 of their forefathers, becoming infantalized and expecting a
 parental Government to take care of them. Thus the original
 meaning of the word "militia" becomes forgotten.

<p>
A militia is not just another term for a second-rate army, or
 for a rabble, or for a State-run army. It has a specific meaning
 and is supposed to be an important institution in the checks
 and balances designed by the Founders.

<p>
The 2nd Amendment states,

<p>
A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of
 a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms
 shall not be infringed. 

<p>Here's my no-fail, handy-dandy, 3-step recipe for crushing 2nd
 Amendment deniers by simple Logic:

<p>
Surely, even gun opponents must admit that the 2nd Amendment
 is not devoid of informational content, and as such, some entity
 must have a right to arms that cannot be infringed.

<p>
Let's ignore for a moment the clear grammar, in which the dependent
 clause of the preamble is simply a justification, and that the
 possessive word "of" modifies the noun "people".

<p>
Pretending we are illiterates, there can only be 3 possibilities:
 the right to bear arms must either belong to the army of the
 Federal government, to an army of a State, or to the People
 individually.

<p>
There are no other possibilities.

<p>
First, clearly it is nonsensical to have an amendment to protect
 Congress from itself! All of the amendments are protections
 for the States or for the People against Federal power; that's
 the whole point of the Bill of Rights. Congress already has
 an explicit power in Article I, Section 8, "to raise and support
 armies". To imagine it also had to be added to the Bill of Rights
 is just plain nuts. Therefore it cannot refer to the Federal
 government.

<p>
Ah, but what of the States! Surely it might mean that a State
 can have an army, which is called for some reason a "militia",
 but never mind why. But that's a contradiction with Article
 I, Section 10: "No state shall...keep troops..." It would be
 bizarre to suppose the first ten Amendments, that came along
 with the whole document when it was first ratified, were meant
 to already modify the main body; any such desired changes at
 that time were incorporated into the main text.

<p>
So that leaves, by process of elimination, the People.

<p>
You know, just like it says!

<p>
But what are we to make of this mention of the militia, isn't
 that the National Guard?

<p>
The riddle is solved by realizing that a militia and an army
 are distinct entities.

<p>
Look at the language used in the Constitution (Article I, Section
 8): armies are "raised" by Congress, and as such are creatures
 purely of the Government, with no existence beyond it.

<p>
But in addition, Congress is given a separate power of "calling
 forth the militia", and

<p>
To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia,
 and for governing such part of them as may be employed by the
 United States...

<p>So if the militia is "organized" or "called forth", that implies
 it already exists in an unorganized form, completely independent
 of Government!

<p>
That's the whole point of the militia, its independence, as
 a check against standing armies.

<p>
When "organized", it becomes what was called a "select" militia,
 and that portion of the general militia that is "employed by
 the United States" we today call the "National Guard."

<p>
Therefore, the National Guard is a subset of the militia, not
 its entirety. And although governors have the privilege of calling
 it forth in peacetime, the Guard is in fact under Federal control
 and acts as the armed reserve of the Federal army.

<p>
This view is further supported by a review of all the State
 Constitutions of the time, as well as the proposed drafts of
 the 2nd Amendment. For example, the New York Convention of July
 26, 1788 suggested

<p>
That the people have the right to keep and bear arms; that a
 well-regulated militia, including the body of the people capable
 of bearing arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defence of
 a free state.

<p>The emphasis is in the original document! That delegation also
 wrote on July 7 that

<p>
no regulations tending to render the general militia useless
 and defenceless, by establishing select corps of militia, of
 distinct bodies of military men, not having permanent interests
 and attachments to the community, ought to be made.

<p>
All delegations submitted similar sentiments. The version finally
 adopted was seen as an elegant distillation of what the Founding
 Fathers saw as completely obvious; it is only the pathetic ignorance
 of history and inability to comprehend English that leads to
 misunderstanding today.

<p>
It could not be clearer.

<p>
But finally, what of that phrase "well-regulated"? It does not
 here mean "subject to regulations", otherwise that would directly
 contradict "shall not be infringed." In my Oxford English Dictionary
 Supplement, it indicates there is an archaic meaning in the
 context when speaking "of troops", meaning "properly disciplined
 in the art of war", or practiced in the manual of arms.

<p>
So next time someone denies an individual right to bear arms,
 ask them to explain who they think that amendment applies to,
 and how it is meant to operate in practice -- their explanations
 will necessarily demonstrate they are claiming the amendment
 in fact means nothing.

<p>
Have them explain what a "collective right" is, which seems
 to be applied to no other right than bearing arms, and seems
 only to mean a right that can be conveniently denied to any
 particular person -- which is no right at all!

<h> Buildings Fell; A Nation Rose 

<p>After leisurely dispensing with the required introductory remarks,
 W then switched gears and delivered a fine speech.

<p>
I was pleased when he drew parallels with the nay-sayers of
 the NYTimes of 1946:

<p>
18 months after the fall of Berlin to allied forces, a journalist
 wrote in the New York Times, "Germany is a land in an acute
 stage of economic, political and moral crisis. [European] capitals
 are frightened. In every [military] headquarters, one meets
 alarmed officials doing their utmost to deal with the consequences
 of the occupation policy that they admit has failed." 

<p>This is the very same observation made on this blog in "The Elusive
 Plan", about Life Magazine's pessimism in 1946...

<p>
Even more gratifying, just hours before the speech in a discussion
 with friends, I wrote the following about the issue of appointing
 new Supreme Court judges over the next few years:

<p>
My sense is that with W, one will get judges who will construe
 the Constitution more based on what it actually says rather
 than what either elite opinion, or what even they themselves,
 would like it to say.

<p>And then I hear tonight Bush pledge,

<p>
I will continue to appoint federal judges who know the difference
 between personal opinion and the strict interpretation of the
 law.

<p>
Bravo!

<p>
Makes me feel almost like a personal advisor to the President.
 :-)

<p>
My main impression from this speech is embodied by phrases like
 "Liberty's Century" and "Freedom on the March". This administration
 will stand for ending the untenable status quo of failed dictatorial
 regimes by spreading Freedom, the best long-term solution for
 making this country safe from nuclear terrorism. Quite a classically
 "liberal" notion!

<p>
This is a Party with a vision and a mission. It stands for something.

And what of the Democrats? The Kerry campaign response seems
 to offer no coherent agenda other than to go "in a new direction."

<p>
So, that would be a direction away from spreading Freedom?

<p>
Leftists used to complaing about how terrible it was we supported
 dictators. Now we're eliminating the dictators and freeing millions,
 and they're still complaining!

<p>
There's just no pleasing these people; they seem to stand for
 nothing but sheer contrarianism! Or perhaps more accurately,
 anti-Americanism.

<p>
And oh yeah, Kerry promises to raise taxes. At least on that
 issue we can be confident of his position!

<p>
In June 2002, al-Qaeda spokesman, Suleiman Abu Gheith, published
 an article on the alneda website that claimed: "We have the
 right to kill four million Americans -- 2 million of them children
 -- and to exile twice as many and wound and cripple hundreds
 of thousands."

<p>
Remember Abu Gheith? The annoying chubby one who would introduce
 bin Laden and Zawahiri in those early videos.

<p>
That's not something to negotiate with. Like what, we'll talk
 them down to only killing 1 million American children?

<p>
Then what is to be done? How to answer this abomination?

<p>
Simple. Mark 9:36/42

<p>
And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when
 he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,And whosoever
 shall offend one of [these] little ones that believe in me,
 it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his
 neck, and he were cast into the sea.
