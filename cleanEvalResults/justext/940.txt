 What figure? An OTD price you plan to offer? 
  
 You do some
 research to determine what the cars are selling for. Then you
 decide on a price you are willing to pay, add in the sales tax
 (3% in VA) and tag/title fee (about $50 in VA), and you have
 an OTD price. 
  
 Then you go to a dealer who has the car you
 want and make an offer. Simple as that.

 I hope you can help me. Cause I feel quite overwhelmed. I am
 looking at a 2006 Mazda Tribute S Auto - No options. The Invoice
 price is 21703 plus 590 destination charge for a total of 22293.
 I figure I should pay between that and the MSRP (23790) to be
 realistic. So I offer 23100 which would mean a profit of 800
 or so for them. Make any sense? 

<p>
 Before we made an offer to buy a Honda Accord last year, I
 went to the 'Prices Paid' forum and tried to determine how much
 others were paying. I was amazed that some people claimed they
 were buying Accords for $500 under invoice. 
  
 We computed
 an OTD price based on $500 under invoice, went to a Honda dealer,
 made an offer, and they accepted. 
  
 I have no idea how much
 Tributes are selling for, so I can't say if your offer makes
 any sense at all. 
  
 From my experience, the TMV price here
 at Edmunds is way too high. 
  
 Of course, your offer will
 probably be refused. If you walk out, there is a good chance
 they will change their mind and accept your offer. That's how
 it has been with our last three car purchases.

 I believe the Tribute is being discontinued by Mazda at the
 end of this year. So, I think you can do a lot better than $800
 over invoice. 
  
 Check out "Negotiation Strategies" and "Buying
 Tips" in the Smart Shopper boards. Consolidate everything you
 read into your own personal method on how to buy cars. If you
 try to decide whos advice to take from the thousands of posts,
 you'll go nuts.

 There will not be a Tribute for model year
 2007 but it will return in early 2007 as a 2008 model...but
 like you mentioned, good deals can easily be found....Especially
 this month without any 3 to sell.
