<h>'Rise in bedroom entrepreneurs'

<p>Jordan Mittelman is obsessed with cycling - a passion he's harnessed to launch an award-winning business in the heart of Washington DC.

<p>The US capital already has a large number of bike shops, and Mr Mittelman knew his High Street store, Bicycle Space, could only succeed by offering customers more than competitive prices and good service.

<p>"People can find all the products we sell online, and are often so well-read and knowledgeable. They've looked up every detail and come in knowing so much," he says.

<p>"To sell to those people you have to appeal to something greater - we're selling a lifestyle and an experience."

<p>Marketers call this insight selling.

<p>"It's learning about the consumer in order to offer the product in a new way that doesn't rely on hard sell," explains Patrick Spenner, managing director of CEB, a global business advisory company that has its headquarters in Washington DC.

<p>Key marketing trends for 2013

<p>As more companies take advantage of digital platforms and new ways of reaching consumers, marketers have predicted a number of trends that should be important for businesses this year:

<p>Insight selling - Offering lifestyle information about a product that is educational and informative instead of relying on hard sell.

<p>Content marketing - Interactive or digital material that influences a consumer's choice during the research and decision making process.

<p>Thought leadership - Creating the perception that the company is innovative and an expert in its field.

<p>Digital analytics - Using the trail of information consumers create online to shape appealing content and inform insight selling.

<p>"For example, I'm a cyclist. I cycle to work regularly and I struggle with finding safe paths. Wouldn't it be great if my local bike shop could use digital media to connect me with other consumers to share information about safer routes?

<p>"That's bringing 'insight' to me about something broader than just my bike. And it creates an attachment to the business that enabled me to gain that insight."

<p>Mr Mittelman knows his customers enjoy the sense of community he and his staff help to create by organising bike rides and group maintenance workshops.

<p>"People want to be a part of something and come to a place where they'll be taken care of. We're really a social gathering spot and an essential place to learn about bikes, use them and have a good time," he says.

<p>Changed strategy

<p>Garry Cha takes a similar approach to market his grocery chain, Yes! Organic Market, taking time to learn about his customers and understand their lifestyles.

<p>Most people who come through his doors are well-educated and health conscious. They want access to organic produce in a retail space that has the convenience of a corner shop.

<p>Mr Cha opened his first store in 1989 and now operates seven across Washington DC with a $30m (Â£20m) turnover. But while his products have remained broadly the same, his advertising strategy has changed dramatically.

<p>Bicycle Space secures customer attachment by organising regular group bike rides around the streets of the US capital

<p>"Until about two years ago we put inserts into the Washington Post newspaper offering monthly savings by the truck loads. But we weren't sure we were getting good results - so we stopped, and now spend the same amount of money on social media," he says.

<p>That enables him to reach customers directly and adapt quickly to changing trends. He also invests in sales technology that allows him to monitor what customers are buying.

<p>And rather than promote individual products, the company's website takes an elliptical approach, offering information about health issues and special diets that link to items available in the store.

<p>'Ultimate economy'

<p>By one estimate, 57% of today's consumers have already made up their mind about what they want to buy before entering a store or engaging with a sales team. And the way they obtain their information has blurred the distinction between marketing and advertising.

<p>When Gary Cha started to sell organic produce he had few rivals, but that is no longer the case

<p>Marketers say most consumers are more likely to seek out online reviews or gather expert advice from independent sources rather than listen to a company message.

<p>As a result, the world's multinational companies are joining small businesses in using insight selling.

<p>And where advertising campaigns used to be a single, high-profile event, they now use insight selling to try to establish a continual presence in the consumer's consciousness - which is becoming easier thanks to mobile technology.
