<h>Japanese business sentiment improves

<p>Japan's stock market has hit its highest level in almost five years, after a central bank  stimulus plan raised hope of economic revival.

<p>The main Nikkei 225 stock index climbed as much as 4.7% to 13,225.62, its highest since August 2008.

<p>The Bank of Japan said on Thursday it would double the country's money supply to spur growth and halt falling prices.

<p>The step was much bigger than expected and signalled a more aggressive approach towards driving growth.

<p>After a day of heavy trading, the Nikkei closed up 1.58%, or 199.10 points, at 12,833.64.

<p>The president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, welcomed the Bank of Japan's commitment to "doing what it takes" to restart growth.

<p>"The critical thing is, a growing Japan is good for everybody. It is very important for the region, but it is important for the entire world," he told the BBC.

<p>Market reaction to the Bank of Japan's new stimulus measures show that Haruhiko Kuroda's bold moves were definitely more than investors expected. Some have praised Mr Kuroda - former president of the Asian Development Bank - for his understanding of how global markets and investors would react when it comes to monetary policy.

<p>The recent hype of what is known as Abenomics - Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's economic policies - may also remind many of what happened under former PM Junichiro Koizumi, whom Mr Abe served as chief cabinet secretary.

<p>Mr Koizumi promoted aggressive structural reforms which also resulted in a sharp fall in the Japanese yen. There are those who warn that at the time the weakening yen didn't help Japan's exporters longer term. And, according to the latest trade figures, exports fell 16% in February from the month before, indicating that the weak yen has yet to help companies to sell more products abroad.

<p>Yen factor

<p>By pumping more money into the system, Japan is hoping to promote price growth, ending a cycle of deflation, recession and sputtering economic recovery.

<p>At the same time, it is also seen as an attempt to weaken its currency and boost exports.

<p>The Japanese yen has declined 4.5% against the US dollar in the past two days, and more than 5% against the euro.

<p>Analysts said the yen was likely to remain weak in the coming months.

<p>"The big party we are having in the markets now is, of course, the financials. Banks are getting more money for free, utilities with big investment projects are getting zero cost capital now," said Martin Schulz from Fujitsu Research Institute.

<p>"The big story, and the lasting story, will be the exporters. A weaker yen helps the exporters to earn money with Japanese technology in Asian markets in particular."
