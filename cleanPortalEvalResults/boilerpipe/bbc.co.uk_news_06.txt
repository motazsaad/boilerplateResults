<p>"I try to get the lip synch precise," he says. "So when you watch it, it looks as though Jeremy is speaking Persian."

<p>According to the BBC's Darius Bazargan, who made a documentary in 2008 about motor racing in Tehran, it is Clarkson's irreverence that endears him to Iranian audiences.

<p>"His humour is so inappropriate and not at all what you hear on state TV - that must account for some of its appeal," he says.

<p>"Jeremy Clarkson is about as opposite to President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad as you can get."

<p>But Iranians - who are allowed to buy 60 litres (13 gallons) of petrol every month at the subsidised price of 4,000 rials (21p or 33 cents) per litre - also love cars.

<p>"There's always been a car culture in Iran," says Bazargan. "It's a very status driven society, and this predates the Islamic Revolution of 1979."

<p>The Porsche is the ultimate Iranian high-status car, a commonplace sight in the affluent neighbourhoods of northern Tehran, though the German company stopped selling cars in Iran last year, in response to pressure from campaigners against the country's nuclear programme. Maserati and Lamborghini have also recently cut all links.

<p>Tell him he can fill up his tank for Â£10 in Iran - does he still want to live in UK?

<p>Iranian car hits end of the road

<p>The former Shah was one Iranian known for his love of classic cars, most of which are now housed in the country's National Car Museum.

<p>He was in power when Iran in the late 1960s began manufacturing the Paykan, a car modelled on the British Hillman Hunter. This, according to Bazargan became feted as "the car of the people" - akin to Germany's Volkswagen.

<p>Clarkson has described it as "terrible", on the grounds of its similarity to the Ford Cortina in which he learned to drive.

<p>"Iranian nukes can't be very advanced if this is their idea of car technology," he once said on air.

<p>But Clarkson says he would welcome the chance to drive one in Iran.

<p>"I'd love to drive through Iran in one of those. It's the sort of thing that Top Gear is all about," he says.

<p>"I'd love to take the show to Iran. We asked, we begged. And the (Iranian) ambassador in London was very sympathetic.

<p>"At the time he had a son who was 14 or 15 years old who loved Top Gear but there is a rule in place that the BBC isn't allowed to go, so we weren't allowed go to, which is very sad - because we're not really very political."

<p>Jeremy Clarkson and Mozaffar Shafeie met one another on The Fifth Floor , on the BBC World Service. Listen on iPlayer or download the podcast .
