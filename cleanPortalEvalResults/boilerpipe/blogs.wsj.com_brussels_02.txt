<p>The problems facing Europe’s banks are believed to be so critical that European leaders are starting to sound like banking regulation geeks. Barely a speech goes by these days without a promise to “recapitalize” the banks.

<p>This rhetoric makes for some uninspiring speeches.Â  (Imagine Roosevelt in the depths of the Great Depression: “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself and also inadequately capitalized banks…..”) And it may be diverting attention away from Europe’s biggest economic problem: lack of aggregate demand.

<p>In 2009, the European Central Bank started doing a twice-yearly survey of euro-zone businesses. Among other questions, each business is asked to identify its most “pressing” problem.

<p>“Finding customers” consistently ranks as the top concern, or nearly so; about 25% of small-and-medium-sized businesses said so in the last survey , conducted from February through March 2011. About 18% of large firms said “finding customers” was their main problem, just behind “competition” and “costs of production and labor.”

<p>“Access to finance” was the most pressing problem for about 15% of SMEs and just 10% of large firms, according to the survey.

<p>This makes sense. In a depressed economy, people are less likely to want to buy your product (or service). And if people don’t want to buy your product, you’re not going to want to borrow money to expand your operations, given that you’re seeing only tepid demand for what you can make using your existing capacity.

<p>More bank capital won’t address this problem. First, banks may be tempted to boost their capital ratios by shedding assets and reducing lending.

<p>Once a bank’s better capitalized, it may be more willing to lend. But governments can’t force businesses and consumers to borrow that money. In fact, large corporations are hoarding record levels of cash, because they can’t see anything worthwhile to spend it on.

<p>Adequately capitalized banks — particularly if they’re staring at major losses from the euro-zone sovereign periphery — are a necessary but insufficient condition for economic recovery. Even if euro-zone governments inject capital into banks to protect them from losses on Greek, Irish and Portuguese debt and also backstop Italy and Spain, consumer demand will still be weak. Businesses will thus be reluctant to expand; wages will be stagnant (or even falling in the euro-zone periphery), exacerbating the debt burden weighing on European households and governments. Unemployment will remain high and growth weak.

<p>Interestingly, access to finance may be even less of a problem for U.S. companies. The National Federation of Independent Business, which represents U.S. SMEs, conducts a monthly survey that asks a version of the most-pressing-problem question. The most recent result : Only 3% of SMEs say credit supply is their biggest business obstacle.

<p>“Poor sales” (i.e. “Finding customers”) is the number one problem.

<p>A warning: These two surveys may not be comparable. The NFIB survey contains 10 options as answers to the biggest-problem question, while the ECB survey contains only 7 (why has the ECB, of all institutions, left out “inflation” has an option for most-pressing problem?); more choices might reduce the percentage garnered by any one option. That means access to finance might be even less of a problem in Europe than indicated by the ECB survey.
