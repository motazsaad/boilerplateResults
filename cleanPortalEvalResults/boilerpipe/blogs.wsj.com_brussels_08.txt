<p>Spain is talking more openly than ever about needing help from Europe to recapitalize its banks, as budget minister CristÃ³bal Montoro toldÂ a radio station in Madrid on Tuesday.

<p>If euro-zone help is to be forthcoming for Spanish banks, Spain (and some others) would prefer that it’s directed from the bailout funds straight to the banks, rather than via the government as it would be under current rules. The problem with lending to the government to recapitalize banks is that it increases the government’s debt, further intensifying the spiral in which weak banks lead to increases in government debt,Â and therefore heightening worries about government solvency, which in turn increases concerns about the banks.

<p>But it’s not immediately clear how you convert the European Stability Mechanism, the euro zone’s bailout fund that should come into existence soon, from a vehicle designed to make loans to governments into one that injects equity into banks. At the very least, the questions it raises suggest such a step may not be achievable soon–even absent any political obstacles such as the need for treaty change.

<p>Under the current system, a government borrows money from the bailout funds to inject into the banks. In return, the lenders demand conditions of the government and the government sets the terms and conditions of the banks for its injection of equity. If the ESM were to directly inject equity then it would presumably have to determine the terms and conditions of those injections. The “question of oversight, imposition and oversight of conditionalities becomes much more salient and problematic,” says Mujtaba Rahman of Eurasia Group. Monitoring of the conditions would presumably have to be done by the European Banking Authority, he suggests.

<p>Then, there’s the question of whetherÂ lenders will lose theirÂ leverage over governments if theÂ banks are recapitalized directly, surely an important issue for Germany and other providers ofÂ aid.Â 

<p>The issue becomes even more complex where banks have cross-border subsidiaries, Mr. Rahman points out.

<p>Other questions: equity is riskier than debt, and the size of the bailout funds might be needed to be increased to take this new role, given the size of Europe’s banking systems. Finally, if Spain getsÂ this concession, might not Ireland be entitled to ask for it in retrospect?
