<p>A Roma woman with a child passes a logo of the European Commission in Brussels.

<p>Not literally. But fur is flying between France and the European Commission, which in the person of Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding this week strongly condemned the ongoing French campaign to deport Gypsies (also known as Roma).

<p>The Roma issue is creeping into todayís EU summit, which is supposed to be about foreign policy.

<p>French officials have lined up to denounce Mrs. Redingís denunciation. Theyíve directed their ire at her remark that forced removal on the basis of ethnicity ìis a situation I would have thought Europe would not have to witness again after the Second World War.î

<p>French President Nicolas Sarkozyís office yesterday put out a brief statement deeming the comments ìoutrageous.î Prime Minister Fran√ßois Fillon stacked up a trio of adjectives: ìimplausible, unimaginable, scandalous.î Even German Chancellor Angela Merkel weighed in Wednesday night, calling the comparison ìunsuitable.î

<p>Mr. Sarkozy has an ally in Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi, and the two appear determined to bring a discussion of Gypsies to the summit.

<p>Mrs. Reding backed off the World War II reference last night, but she nonetheless appears to have outmaneuvered France.

<p>No European commissioner ó indeed, no European politician ó plays the Nazi card lightly, and Mrs. Reding is among the most media-savvy people in Brussels. Her reference appeared carefully calibrated ó itís in her prepared remarks ó and it served its purpose.

<p>France is left to sputter that its deportations arenít as bad as the Nazisí, while Mrs. Redingís point ó that itís plainly illegal to select deportees by race ó is left largely unchallenged.

<p>And by making the remark two days before the summit, Mrs. Reding all but guarantees that Mr. Sarkozy himself will have to address it if he holds his customary press conference this afternoon.

<p>Stay tuned.
