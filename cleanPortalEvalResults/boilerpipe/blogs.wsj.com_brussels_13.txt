<p>European institutions are set to enjoy a bit of a break next week, as the May 1 holiday on WednesdayÂ will slow work. But the few events scheduled will be key to understanding the state of theÂ European Union’s economy.

<p>Here’s a list:

<p>Monday, the European Commission’s task force working on Greece will present its fourth-quarter report. “The report describes the assistance provided by the task force, the member states, international organisations and other specialist bodies to support Greece in the implementation of comprehensive program of reforms,” the commission explained. It should give a sense of where things are headed inÂ the country that risked putting an end to the single currency.

<p>Tuesday, the two top EU VIPs –European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and the President of the EU Council, Herman Van Rompuy– will be in the Netherlands to celebrate the investiture of King Willem-Alexander .

<p>Wednesday is a bank holiday — European Labor Day (known in some quarters as International Workers’ Day).

<p>Thursday, Mr. Van Rompuy will be in Portugal , where he will meet the president and the prime minister.

<p>Friday will be THE day: The commission will present its spring economic forecast , its regular outlook for the economy, by country. The forecast is crucial because it will form the basis of the commission’s oversight of the bloc’s economic reforms andÂ its recommendations to national governments.
