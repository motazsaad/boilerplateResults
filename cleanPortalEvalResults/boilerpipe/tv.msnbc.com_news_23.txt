<p>Did the conversation that happened on the March 17 episode ofÂ Up w/ Chris Hayes predict what would happen with President Obama’s budget proposal this week?

<p>On that show, host Chris Hayes sat down with Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., podcast host Sam Seder, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and The Guardian’s Heidi Moore to discuss how the “center” of the debate over the next budget could be found so much closer to Paul Ryan’s plan than that put forward by the Congressional Progressive Caucus. As Nadler pointed out during the conversation, the progressive proposal was unlikely to gain any traction, but many progressives and supporters of the president remained hopeful that any compromise budget would not include major cuts to the social safety net.

<p>Those hopes were crushed Friday when reports from the White House confirmed that the budget President Obama planned to unveil next week would include reductions in Social Security, Medicare despite widespread popular opposition. These cuts were not enough to satisfy House Majority Leader John Boehner, who insisted that the president’s cuts were not deep enough and his proposed tax increases were too onerous.

<p>Now that it is crystal clear that any compromise between Republican House members and the president will result in a deeply conservative policy, go back and watch Hayes and his guests break down how it all happened, tune in Sunday for the last episode of Up w/ Chris Hayes, and come back on April 13 for Up w Steve Kornacki.
