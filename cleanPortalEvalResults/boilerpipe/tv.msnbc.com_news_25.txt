<p>The All In with Chris Hayes team puts out a daily call to the Twitter and Facebook communities for the “awesomest things” they encountered on the Internet.

<p>1. Â WithÂ the advent of their new on-lineÂ project, “ Times Haiku ,”Â The New York Times shows us that reading the news can be a doubly enriching experience. Watch Chris as he recites his favorites.

<p>2. Â Remember the cop who tried to infiltrate Occupy Wall Street masquerading as a hipster ? Well there’s a digital incarnation of “Hipster Cop” trying to gain inside access to Boston’s DIY Indie-Rock scene. Thanks to Twitter fan, Shaleen Title , for tipping us off to this droll news item.

<p>@ chrislhayes These Boston cops pretending to be “punks” was funniest thing I’ve seen in a while slate.com/articles/news_â€¦ #click3

<p>3. Â Did you know host of All In with Chris Hayes is a big proponent of biking ? He is. When Twitter fan,Â  Matt Moffat,Â  submitted one designer’s mock-upsÂ of what the Keystone XL Pipeline would look like as a transnational bike path, Chris spun a wheelie .
