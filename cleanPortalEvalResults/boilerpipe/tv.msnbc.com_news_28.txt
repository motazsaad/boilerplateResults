<p>Civil rights groups in North Carolina are already preparing to fight voter ID legislation that is almost certain to become law.

<p>On Sunday’s Up with Steve Kornacki, Rev. William Barber, President of the North Carolina NAACP, discussed his group’s plans to work with a coalition of other civil rights organizations to launch a two-pronged attack on the many bills that would restrict voting rights, particularly among low-income and minority voters.

<p>The measures would require photo identification at polling places as well as eliminate early voting and Sunday voting.

<p>It’s “the white southern strategy being revisited with a 21st century twist,” Barber said.

<p>He announced that activists groups would issue a call “to prayer, to protest, and to non-violent civil disobedience” Sunday night at a Durham church. He also announced that local clergy members and students would be staging a “pray in” on Monday.

<p>Rev. Barber also spoke about the coalition’s likely legal strategy once the bill is signed into law, one that will include challenges based on possible violations of the 15th and 24th amendments to the U.S. constitution.

<p>Watch Steve Kornacki’s full interview with Rev. Barber and watch Up with Steve Kornacki every Saturday and Sunday at 8 AM.
