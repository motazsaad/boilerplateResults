<p>Nearly a half a million people have signed a petition urging the SEC to require greater disclosure from corporations about their political donations. On Sundayís Up with Steve Kornacki, the panel discussed the effect the rule might have, its potential benefits and drawbacks, and the broader question of how the SEC can (and if it can) regulate money in politics.

<p>As the New York Times reported on Tuesday , a broad coalition of activists, Democratic officials, and other interested parties has formed to pressure the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to create a new rule that would require publicly traded corporations to disclose its political expenditures to its shareholders. It is possible to comment directly the SEC and add your opinion to the discussion. How does one do it?

<p>If you want to add your voice to the conversation about regulating money in politics, corporate speech, and government regulation, read about the issue, watch the videos from Sundayís Up with Steve Kornacki, and send an email to rule-comments@sec.gov with the subject: ‚ÄúComment on File Number 4-637‚Äù and add your thoughts.

<p>Watch Up with Steve Kornacki every Saturday and Sunday at 8 AM.
