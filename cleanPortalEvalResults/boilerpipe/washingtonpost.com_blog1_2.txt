<p>Games and puzzles offerings expand for Washington Post readers

<p>By Washington Post Editors

<p>We’re pleased to announce that we’re expanding our entertainment offerings with the launch of WP Games . This new section of our Web site, at games.washingtonpost.com , will offer dozens of interactive games, puzzles and quizzes. Best of all? Playing won’t cost you a dime.

<p>Our roster of offerings includes arcade games, word games, card games and strategy puzzles. Like letters? Race the clock to form words with Spellbound . Got an eye for detail? Match tiles in Mahjongg or hunt through a Word Search . The visually inclined can try a Jigsaw, while card fans can play Spider Solitaire and Pool .

<p>And the favorites you’ve played on washingtonpost.com for years are still here: Crickler , Sudoku and our three popular puzzles — the Daily Crossword from Bob Klahn and CrosSynergy; the Sunday Crossword by Merl Reagle; and the Post Puzzler from Peter Gordon and Fireball Crosswords.

<p>Our new interactive offerings are the work of online games developer Arkadium. They’re all Flash-based, so you’ll need to be sure you’ve installed and updated your Adobe Flash Player before you get started. If you need assistance along the way, check out our Help page or FAQs .

<p>Each game is free. Many can be printed to take on the road with you. And we’re looking forward to making them accessible to mobile devices in the future.

<p>We hope you’ll have fun exploring this new section. Ready to play? Game on .
