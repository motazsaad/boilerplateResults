<p>Calling all Hax-Philes! You can now chat about your favorite Carolyn Hax content — from the letters that shocked you the most to the poignant advice that helped you — in our new Carolyn Hax forum .

<p>WeÂ  recently rolled out forums for sports, politics and other topics on washingtonpost.com. For Hax fans, we’ve set up a forum that will allow you to discuss columns and weekly chats , seek advice from other readers and even go off topic , if that’s your thing. The forum will also be the new home for Hax-Philes, where Carolyn lets readers weigh in on the qualms of advice-seeking letter writers.

<p>Creating new forum topics is easy –Â Â click the New Topic button, fill in the fields that appear and click Post.

<p>You can also create polls for other readers to take.Â  Click “New Polls” next to “New Topics” and follow the easy-to-follow instructions.
