<p>Successful small firms are coming up with novel ways to connect with their customers, as the BBC&#039;s Jane O&#039;Brien reports from Washington DC

<p>Jordan Mittelman is obsessed with cycling - a passion he&#039;s harnessed to launch an award-winning business in the heart of Washington DC. 

<p>The US capital already has a large number of bike shops, and Mr Mittelman knew his High Street store, Bicycle Space, could only succeed by offering customers more than competitive prices and good service.  

<p>&quot;People can find all the products we sell online, and are often so well-read and knowledgeable. They&#039;ve looked up every detail and come in knowing so much,&quot; he says. 

<p>&quot;To sell to those people you have to appeal to something greater - we&#039;re selling a lifestyle and an experience.&quot; 

<p>Marketers call this insight selling. 

<p>&quot;It&#039;s learning about the consumer in order to offer the product in a new way that doesn&#039;t rely on hard sell,&quot; explains Patrick Spenner, managing director of CEB, a global business advisory company that has its headquarters in Washington DC.

<p>Key marketing trends for 2013 

<p>As more companies take advantage of digital platforms and new ways of reaching consumers, marketers have predicted a number of trends that should be important for businesses this year: 

<p>Insight selling - Offering lifestyle information about a product that is educational and informative instead of relying on hard sell.  

<p>Content marketing - Interactive or digital material that influences a consumer&#039;s choice during the research and decision making process. 

<p>Thought leadership - Creating the perception that the company is innovative and an expert in its field. 

<p>Digital analytics - Using the trail of information consumers create online to shape appealing content and inform insight selling. 

<p>&quot;For example, I&#039;m a cyclist. I cycle to work regularly and I struggle with finding safe paths. Wouldn&#039;t it be great if my local bike shop could use digital media to connect me with other consumers to share information about safer routes? 

<p>&quot;That&#039;s bringing &#039;insight&#039; to me about something broader than just my bike. And it creates an attachment to the business that enabled me to gain that insight.&quot; 

<p>Mr Mittelman knows his customers enjoy the sense of community he and his staff help to create by organising bike rides and group maintenance workshops.  

<p>&quot;People want to be a part of something and come to a place where they&#039;ll be taken care of. We&#039;re really a social gathering spot and an essential place to learn about bikes, use them and have a good time,&quot; he says. 

<p>   Changed strategy 

<p>Garry Cha takes a similar approach to market his grocery chain, Yes! Organic Market, taking time to learn about his customers and understand their lifestyles. 

<p>Most people who come through his doors are well-educated and health conscious. They want access to organic produce in a retail space that has the convenience of a corner shop.  

<p>Mr Cha opened his first store in 1989 and now operates seven across Washington DC with a $30m (Â£20m) turnover. But while his products have remained broadly the same, his advertising strategy has changed dramatically. 

<p>   Bicycle Space secures customer attachment by organising regular group bike rides around the streets of the US capital 

<p>&quot;Until about two years ago we put inserts into the Washington Post newspaper offering monthly savings by the truck loads. But we weren&#039;t sure we were getting good results - so we stopped, and now spend the same amount of money on social media,&quot; he says. 

<p>That enables him to reach customers directly and adapt quickly to changing trends. He also invests in sales technology that allows him to monitor what customers are buying. 

<p>And rather than promote individual products, the company&#039;s website takes an elliptical approach, offering information about health issues and special diets that link to items available in the store. 

<p>   'Ultimate economy' 

<p>By one estimate, 57% of today&#039;s consumers have already made up their mind about what they want to buy before entering a store or engaging with a sales team. And the way they obtain their information has blurred the distinction between marketing and advertising. 

<p>   When Gary Cha started to sell organic produce he had few rivals, but that is no longer the case 

<p>Marketers say most consumers are more likely to seek out online reviews or gather expert advice from independent sources rather than listen to a company message.  

<p>As a result, the world&#039;s multinational companies are joining small businesses in using insight selling. 

<p>And where advertising campaigns used to be a single, high-profile event, they now use insight selling to try to establish a continual presence in the consumer&#039;s consciousness - which is becoming easier thanks to mobile technology.

<p>Just because it's digital doesn't mean it always works&rdquo; 

<p>   End Quote  Russell Glass  Chief Executive, Bizo 

<p>In 2010 Volkswagen became the first carmaker to launch a new car in the US entirely on a mobile platform. Research revealed that the target customers - young men - were also avid iPhone users who liked playing games. As a result, Washington-based advertising agency AKQA was commissioned to develop an app for a game featuring the new Golf GTI. 

<p>Within five days Real Racing GTI had been downloaded more than 800,000 times and became the number one free app on Apple&#039;s iTunes App Store in 36 countries. Downloads have since exceeded 3.7 million. 

<p>&quot;It was a minimal investment with a huge impact,&quot; says Erik Rogstad, managing director of AKQA. 

<p>&quot;It&#039;s the ultimate economy - if you have a great viable product. If people like it, it will be found and shared and talked about and the more people will download it. So there&#039;s never been a better time from a digital perspective to get new and engaging content out there - especially if you&#039;re a small player.&quot;  

<p>   'Elegantly target'  

<p>Yet other experts sound a note of caution regarding the benefits of insight selling via the internet and smartphones, especially for small firms. 

<p>&quot;Just because it&#039;s digital doesn&#039;t mean it always works,&quot; says Russell Glass, chief executive of San Francisco-based marketing company Bizo. 

<p>   Bicycle Space owner Jordan Mittleman uses insight selling to compete with online bike sellers 

<p>&quot;It&#039;s based on the audience you&#039;re trying to reach and the product or service you&#039;re delivering. 

<p>&quot;If your audience is not digital, if they&#039;re not consuming content online, then no, it&#039;s not important to be digital.&quot; 

<p>He says many small businesses could do just as well by putting up a sign on the High Street. 

<p>Mr Glass also thinks it will take another year before businesses can take full advantage of the benefits of mobile technology because different systems aren&#039;t yet fully compatible.  

<p>&quot;The opportunity is out there,&quot; he says. &quot;But the delivery mechanism and the format isn&#039;t - and that&#039;s what needs to shift to really make mobile important. For instance viewing a banner ad on a mobile device today is really not a very good experience. You&#039;re squinting and your fat thumb is clicking on an ad by mistake.  

<p>   Digital marketing via an extensive and informative website is a way for some small retailers to get customers through their doors
