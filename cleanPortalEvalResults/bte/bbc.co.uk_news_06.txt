<p>It&#039;s the most widely watched factual TV programme in the world, according to Guinness World Records - Top Gear is watched in 214 territories, and dubbed into eight languages. One of the latest countries to succumb to its charms is, unexpectedly, Iran. 

<p>When Mozaffar Shafeie, an Iranian actor living in London, was in Kurdistan a few weeks ago a whisper went round the party he was attending. 

<p>&quot;Is it him? Is he really the guy that does Top Gear?&quot; 

<p>Soon enough a group of Kurdish teenage boys put the question directly. Shafeie, who does indeed have a close connection with the programme, replied: &quot;Yes, I am Jeremy Clarkson.&quot; 

<p>They looked sceptical, until he declaimed loudly, &quot;Emshab!&quot; - Farsi for &quot;Tonight!&quot;, the word with which Clarkson, the show&#039;s outspoken and politically incorrect lead presenter, frequently opens the programme (usually followed by a long pause). 

<p>   Shafeie says Iranian audiences enjoy Clarkson&#039;s pungent turn of phrase 

<p>Shafeie is the voice actor who dubs Jeremy Clarkson into Farsi, and this one word sent the boys - and nearby onlookers - into a flurry of excited whoops and screams. 

<p>&quot;It was like Beatlemania,&quot; says Shafeie. &quot;I even signed some autographs.&quot; 

<p>Iranian viewers have been watching the programme on BBC Persian TV (PTV) since 2009.  

<p>The BBC cannot operate freely in Iran, so Top Gear&#039;s popularity is hard to measure. But last year, when PTV dropped an episode to air an exclusive interview with then US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the audience protested bitterly.  

<p>Clarkson himself was aware of the show&#039;s popularity in Iran, but still surprised by the outpouring of support. 

<p>&quot;Hillary Clinton has got many things to say about Iran,&quot; he says.

<p>&quot;You&#039;d have thought that the Iranians would have found this relatively interesting - more interesting anyway than three fat old men falling over. I&#039;m delighted to hear that we&#039;re more interesting than Hillary Clinton.&quot; 

<p>When the Top Gear season ends, PTV replaces it with its sister programme Top Gear USA, and this too has prompted complaints, one viewer objecting - with Clarkson-like bluntness - that the presenters were &quot;not funny&quot;. 

<p>Shafeie attributes the success of the programme in large part to Clarkson&#039;s colourful language and racy anecdotes, which he so faithfully dubs into Farsi. Including phrases like &quot;gentlemen&#039;s sausage&quot;, used to describe a shape he drew on the ground by with the tyres of a car, and &quot;Pharaoh&#039;s dried testicles&quot; - in reference to some truffles that Jeremy and his fellow presenters were tasting.

<p>The Top Gear phenomenon 

<p> UK version is watched in 214 territories by 350 million people 

<p> Dubbed into eight languages: Farsi, French, Spanish, Italian, German, Polish, Hungarian and Russian 

<p> The show, first screened in 1977 and relaunched in 2002, has stuck to the same theme tune - &quot;Jessica&quot; by The Allman Brothers 

<p> Versions (with different presenters) are made in the US, Australia and Russia 

<p>  Top Gear reach and audience 

<p>  Can Top Gear conquer the US? 

<p>&quot;I try to get the lip synch precise,&quot; he says. &quot;So when you watch it, it looks as though Jeremy is speaking Persian.&quot; 

<p>According to the BBC&#039;s Darius Bazargan, who made a documentary in 2008 about motor racing in Tehran, it is Clarkson&#039;s irreverence that endears him to Iranian audiences. 

<p>&quot;His humour is so inappropriate and not at all what you hear on state TV - that must account for some of its appeal,&quot; he says. 

<p>&quot;Jeremy Clarkson is about as opposite to President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad as you can get.&quot; 

<p>But Iranians - who are allowed to buy 60 litres (13 gallons) of petrol every month at the subsidised price of 4,000 rials (21p or 33 cents) per litre - also love cars. 

<p>&quot;There&#039;s always been a car culture in Iran,&quot; says Bazargan. &quot;It&#039;s a very status driven society, and this predates the Islamic Revolution of 1979.&quot;  

<p>The Porsche is the ultimate Iranian high-status car, a commonplace sight in the affluent neighbourhoods of northern Tehran, though the German company stopped selling cars in Iran last year, in response to pressure from campaigners against the country&#039;s nuclear programme. Maserati and Lamborghini have also recently cut all links.

<p>Questions for Clarkson from Iran 

<p> Would Jeremy like to come to Iran? 

<p> What does Jeremy think of the Paykan? 

<p> Did he like the sheep&#039;s head and trotter he ate in the Middle East Episode of Top Gear (a popular breakfast dish in Iran) 

<p> Tell him he can fill up his tank for Â£10 in Iran - does he still want to live in UK?  

<p>  Iranian car hits end of the road 

<p>The former Shah was one Iranian known for his love of classic cars, most of which are now housed in the country&#039;s National Car Museum. 

<p>He was in power when Iran in the late 1960s began manufacturing the Paykan, a car modelled on the British Hillman Hunter. This, according to Bazargan became feted as &quot;the car of the people&quot; - akin to Germany&#039;s Volkswagen.  

<p>Clarkson has described it as &quot;terrible&quot;, on the grounds of its similarity to the Ford Cortina in which he learned to drive. 

<p>&quot;Iranian nukes can&#039;t be very advanced if this is their idea of car technology,&quot; he once said on air. 

<p>But Clarkson says he would welcome the chance to drive one in Iran.  

<p>&quot;I&#039;d love to drive through Iran in one of those. It&#039;s the sort of thing that Top Gear is all about,&quot; he says. 

<p>&quot;I&#039;d love to take the show to Iran. We asked, we begged. And the (Iranian) ambassador in London was very sympathetic. 

<p>&quot;At the time he had a son who was 14 or 15 years old who loved Top Gear but there is a rule in place that the BBC isn&#039;t allowed to go, so we weren&#039;t allowed go to, which is very sad - because we&#039;re not really very political.&quot;
