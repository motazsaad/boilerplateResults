<p>   International nuclear bank in Kazakhstan 

<p>   Soviet nuclear tests leave Kazakh fallout 

<p>   Legacy of Soviet nuclear testing   Watch 

<p>&quot;We live in a gas chamber,&quot; says Denis Danielevsky, pointing at several smoking chimney stacks on a hill overlooking a huge industrial area in the town of Ust-Kamenogorsk, eastern Kazakhstan. 

<p>Mr Danielevsky is the editor of a local independent newspaper.  

<p>It has been writing about the Kazakh government&#039;s plans to host a nuclear fuel bank under UN control at Ulba metallurgy plant.  

<p>It was once a top secret Soviet facility but today it is the biggest uranium production factory in Kazakhstan. 

<p>&quot;The air quality is very bad here and any project with the word nuclear causes a negative reaction among people,&quot; says Mr Danielevsky.  

<p>But the government of Kazakhstan has a different view. In 2009 President Nursultan Nazarbayev offered to host a nuclear fuel bank under the International Atomic Energy Agency&#039;s jurisdiction. 

<p>The project is aimed at encouraging countries like Iran not to pursue their own uranium enrichment technologies.  

<p>Instead client countries would have a guaranteed access to low enriched uranium to fuel civil nuclear reactors. 

<p>   Pride in non-proliferation 

<p>Formal negotiations between the IAEA and Kazakhstan began last year.  

<p>An IAEA delegation visited the proposed site in Ust-Kamenogorsk and made a number of recommendations to the government of Kazakhstan. 

<p>   The bank would provide low-enriched uranium to countries for energy purposes 

<p>&quot;Taking into account that the plant will be operating under international standards the impact on the environment and public health will be practically zero,&quot; says the chairman of Kazakhstan&#039;s atomic energy committee Temir Zhantikin. 

<p>&quot;The Ulba plant has been working for more than 60 years in this field and they have high standards for nuclear safety and security.  

<p>&quot;We never thought about commercial preferences because the project is mainly aimed at nuclear non-proliferation.&quot; 

<p>Kazakhstan&#039;s leadership prides itself on its history of non-proliferation: in 1991 the country shut down the Soviet Union&#039;s main nuclear testing site at Semipalatinsk. Over four decades more than 450 nuclear tests were carried out there. 

<p>The country also voluntarily gave up a huge nuclear weapons arsenal inherited after the collapse of the Soviet Union. 

<p>Last year, Kazakhstan became the world&#039;s top uranium producer. Hosting the multinational talks on Iran&#039;s nuclear programme and talking up the nuclear fuel bank has boosted Kazakhstan&#039;s image as a suitable peace broker. 

<p>   'Chicken and egg' 

<p>   Opponents of the bank are worried about the potential impact on the environment 

<p>But subscribing to a nuclear fuel bank has so far not been on the negotiating table between UN Security Council members, Germany and Iran.  

<p>&quot;Until you get a specific resolution on the Iranian issue and remove that off the table you are not going to get onto the general point of discussion on the bank. It becomes a chicken and egg thing,&quot; Professor Scott Lucas, a specialist on Iran from Birmingham University, says.  

<p>Last September, IAEA Director General Yukia Amano said that work to establish a low enriched uranium bank in Kazakhstan &quot;continued to make progress&quot;.  

<p>But there has been no deadline set for establishing the bank nor is it clear which countries are willing to sign up to it.  

<p>Four years since Kazakhstan announced its willingness to host the bank the people of Ust-Kamenogorsk may not have to worry just yet.
