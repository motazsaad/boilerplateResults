<p>   China culls birds as flu toll rises 

<p>Chinese officials in the city of Shanghai have ordered the temporary closure of its poultry markets due to the H7N9 bird flu outbreak. 

<p>A spokesman for the city authorities said the decision was taken on grounds of public safety.  

<p>The city has already begun a mass slaughter of poultry after the virus was discovered in pigeons at a market. 

<p>Six people have died in this latest outbreak. The H7N9 virus is a form of avian flu not seen before in humans. 

<p>China has officially confirmed 14 cases and six deaths due to H7N9 infection as of Friday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement.  

<p>The cases are reportedly from eastern China, including in Shanghai and Zhejiang province. 

<p>WHO says there is currently no evidence of human-to-human transmission. 

<p>&quot;We have 14 cases in a large geographical area, we have no sign of any epidemiological linkage between the confirmed cases and we have no sign of sustained human-to-human transmission,&quot; WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said in Geneva. 

<p>The latest fatality was a farmer, 64, who died in Zhejiang province, state-run media say. 

<p>Four of the bird flu fatalities and six of the 14 cases have been recorded in Shanghai.  

<p>The city is also monitoring another person who was in close contact with one of those who died after showing flu-like symptoms.  

<p>Shanghai health official, Wu Fan, was quoted by Agence-France Presse news agency as saying that the person tested negative for H7N9. 

<p>&quot;There is no possibility of spreading the infection overseas,&quot; Wu Fan also told a press conference.  

<p>Officials ordered the slaughter of at least 20,000 birds starting late on Thursday after the virus was detected in pigeons sold in Huhuai market. 

<p>The market was sealed and police stood watch as workers disinfected the areas, reports say. 

<p>Xu Wei, a spokesman for the Shanghai government, said trading of live poultry will be suspended on Saturday.
