<p>At least 40 people have died, including 11 children, after a building under construction collapsed near the Indian city of Mumbai, police say. 

<p>Dozens have been injured and many others are feared trapped beneath the seven-storey building in Thane.  

<p>Police said the block was an illegal construction and building work was going on even though four floors were already occupied. 

<p>Building collapses are common with poor construction practices often blamed. 

<p>The BBC&#039;s Sameer Hashmi, who is at the scene of the accident, says rescue workers are still trying to clear the debris.

<p>The building collapse underlines the issue of illegal construction in India.  

<p>Police say the builder of the high rise used sub-standard construction material and did not possess an occupation certificate. 

<p>There are hundreds of similar illegal high rises in the Mumbai region. Due to a high population growth, there is always demand for cheap housing. And homes in illegal buildings sell at a lower price compared to those in legal ones.  

<p>Activists also allege that unscrupulous builders often pay hefty bribes to authorities who turn a blind eye to these illegal structures and do not take any action against the builders. 

<p>Bodies are still being pulled out and rescuers say they fear that many people are still stuck under the rubble, our correspondent says. 

<p>Most people living in the building are from the low-to-middle income groups, he adds.  

<p>Witnesses say the construction of the building started just six weeks ago and in that time, seven floors were built rapidly and the eighth floor was under construction.  

<p>Even though the construction was incomplete, the builder had allowed families to move in, our correspondent adds.  

<p>On Thursday evening a section of the building collapsed, bringing the entire structure down, police said. 

<p>Rescue efforts continued throughout the night and dozens have been injured.

<p>It is not yet clear what caused the collapse, but police inspector Digamber Jangale told the BBC it appeared to be due to the use of substandard building material.  

<p>Police said a case had been registered and an inquiry had begun and that they were searching for the builders to arrest them. 

<p>One witness, named only as Ramlal, said the building appeared to tilt before quickly collapsing. 

<p>&quot;The building collapsed like a pack of cards within three to four seconds,&quot; he said. 

<p>In December, at least 13 people died when part of a half-constructed building collapsed in the Wagholi area of Maharashtra. 

<p>Last September, at least six people were killed when a building collapsed in Pune city in Maharashtra.
