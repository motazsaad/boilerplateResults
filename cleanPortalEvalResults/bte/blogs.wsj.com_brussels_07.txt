<p>French President Nicolas Sarkozy gestures while speaking during a final press conference at an EU summit in Brussels on Saturday. 

<p>Was Friday the day the governments of the euro zone realized the scale of the threat that confronts the common currency? If the language used after the summit of euro-zone leaders is any guide, the answer is yes. And the extraordinary   promise   to create a mechanism to save the euro zone and impose costs on speculators &#8212; details to come after finance ministers and others meet on Sunday &#8212; also suggested yes. 

<p>Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, said the euro zone was facing the most serious crisis since its creation. &#8220;The crisis is systemic; the response must be systemic,&#8221; he said. 

<p>Months of   delays   in putting together a Greece bailout package, in which the euro zone&#8217;s crisis went from bad to worse, were suggesting to many observers, not least   in Washington  , that Europe&#8217;s political leaders had neither the will nor the way to stop the crisis in its tracks. In the early hours of Saturday morning, the leaders emerged from their meeting and said: &#8220;Yes, we can.&#8221; Whether in fact they can remains to be seen. 

<p>It&#8217;s worth summing up just what was happening in the financial markets in past week which has stirred the leaders of Europe. Against a backdrop of riots in the streets of Athens, yields on the bonds of other euro-zone governments in southern Europe climbed alarmingly. Yields on Portuguese two-year bonds rose above 8%, on a par with Greek government bond yields just a few weeks ago, indicating real default concerns. Stories started swirling around that some banks couldn&#8217;t find buyers for Italian government bonds. As the euro sank, anxieties grew about European banks, many of which are big holders of government bonds. It began to look like the second phase of the crisis that began with subprime in the U.S. 

<p>According to Mr. Sarkozy, a group of leaders arrived early in Brussels on Friday to talk about what needed to be done. He, Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, Angela Merkel of Germany, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero of Spain, José Socrates of Portugal met with Herman Van Rompuy, the European Union president, José Manuel Barroso, the head of the European Commission, and Jean-Claude Trichet, the European Central Bank chief, in caucus before the full summit that took place over dinner. 

<p>Mr. Sarkozy said the emergency mechanism would be ready by the time the markets opened Monday morning and wouldn&#8217;t require changes to EU treaties, clearly recognizing that such delays would be a signal to resume the assault on the euro-zone&#8217;s markets. The ministers&#8217; job Sunday would be to &#8220;finalize the technical modalities&#8221; of the package, he said, an unfortunate echo of a   phrase we often heard   earlier in the crisis. 

<p>What is contemplated? One possibility is direct borrowing by the European Commission, the EU&#8217;s executive arm, which would be guaranteed by European nations. A similar structure was used in earlier bailouts of non-euro-zone countries such as Hungary &#8212; though a different mechanism would have to be used to help a euro-zone government. A fund financed in this way could, some analysts say, buy government bonds. What size would this need to be? The only answer would seem to be: Very big. 

<p>This raises a lot of questions. According to the summit declaration, the meeting Sunday is of the finance ministers of the 27 states of the EU &#8212; not just the 16 euro-zone members. Mr. Sarkozy spoke of a decision being made, if necessary, using qualified majority voting&#8211;suggesting that if any opposition came from  governments outside the euro-zone, they might find themselves outvoted. It is not clear either whether the non-euro governments &#8212; including the current government-in-limbo of the U.K. &#8212; would be expected to make a financial contribution. 

<p>Moreover, Germany&#8217;s view of all this remains to emerge even though Mr. Sarkozy insisted that he and Ms. Merkel were at one. As he gave his press conference on a stage bedecked by eurozone flags, the German chancellor exited quietly. Perhaps more European bailout talk is not what she needs ahead of Sunday&#8217;s regional election in North Rhine-Westphalia. 

<p>Other elements could also emerge in coming days. To help the banks, it is possible that the European Central Bank will announce it&#8217;s willing to provide more one-year money to banks, replacing a program that rolls off in July. (The prospect of the ECB itself buying government bonds may not be efficient if the idea is to help ease sovereign debt worries, given the central bank appears to be unable to target the markets in which it intervenes, as explained   here  .) 

<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve   could provide dollars    to Europe at some point if it felt that there were shortages. Meanwhile, the board of the International Monetary Fund meets Sunday to sign off on its contribution to the Greece bailout. 

<p>In their   story   on Washington&#8217;s concerns about events in Europe, my colleagues Bob Davis and Jon Hilsenrath say this: 

<p>Both Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and White House economist Lawrence Summers like to quote former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo as saying: &#8220;Markets overreact &#8212; and that means policy has to overreact.&#8221; 

<p>Interesting to hear Mr. Sarkozy echoing that in the early hours of Saturday morning. The euro zone is facing “an exceptional situation,&#8221; he said, &#8221;to which we have to bring an exceptional response.” Quite how exceptional we should be able to judge in the next 48 hours.

<p>The &#8220;over-reaction&#8221; is finally a market recognition that Europe has allowed its unions and citizens to go &#8220;too far&#8221; in a number of countries. 

<p>As a Greek teacher was quoted on a TV interview this week in speaking about her salary &#8220;Well, some people have a swimming pool and I don&#8217;t!&#8221; (i.e. why should she sacrifice, the person with a pool could give that up to pay her). 

<p>Likewise, European public unions (like those in the US) believe they are &#8220;entitled&#8221; to raises even if their productivity is flat and the economy is in a recession. 

<p>Hopefully the markets will respond (continue to respond) in recognizing that the social entitlement model is broken and the use of endless government deficits or growth crippling taxes are NOT the solution. 

<p>Somehow it seems as though most politicians are hoping to ignore this issue a while longer.

<p>ok, guys, the panic should be finished.   The responsibility is not only attriuibile to financial markets and to some players (like Soros &#8230;), but also to the media and the European governments . The Greeks had retouched the Public Accounts and European states have moved theirself late.   But what has happened, in my opinion, is excessive.   Greece is one small (but great for cultural roots) nation &#8230;

Now that we are all together on the edge of the cliff guess what .It isn&#8217;t Greece&#8217;s fault .It&#8217;s Merckel&#8217;s and the speculators&#8217; fault.   I am a civil engineer (in contrast of some commentators who call themshelves analysts ,i have a real job.)   Right now i&#8217;m thinking of leaving for a beautiful Greek island where i will spend some time sipping my OUZO and eating my KEBAB there by the beach. And when i&#8217;m finished i will send the bill to Merckel and to all of these sellfullfilling prophets overseas. Get ready guys ,time to cough it up. And lots of it this time.
