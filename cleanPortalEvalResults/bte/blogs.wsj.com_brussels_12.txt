<p>A Roma woman with a child passes a logo of the European Commission in Brussels. 

<p>Not literally. But fur is flying between France and the European Commission, which in the person of Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding this week   strongly condemned the ongoing French campaign to deport Gypsies   (also known as Roma). 

<p>The Roma issue is creeping into today&#8217;s EU summit, which is supposed to be about foreign policy. 

<p>French officials have lined up to denounce Mrs. Reding&#8217;s denunciation. They&#8217;ve directed their ire at her remark that forced removal on the basis of ethnicity &#8220;is a situation I would have thought Europe would not have to witness again after the Second World War.&#8221; 

<p>French President Nicolas Sarkozy&#8217;s office yesterday put out a brief statement deeming the comments &#8220;outrageous.&#8221; Prime Minister François Fillon stacked up a trio of adjectives: &#8220;implausible, unimaginable, scandalous.&#8221; Even German Chancellor Angela Merkel weighed in Wednesday night, calling the comparison &#8220;unsuitable.&#8221; 

<p>Mr. Sarkozy has an ally in Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi, and the two appear determined to bring a discussion of Gypsies to the summit. 

<p>Mrs. Reding backed off the World War II reference last night, but she nonetheless appears to have outmaneuvered France. 

<p>No European commissioner &#8212; indeed, no European politician &#8212; plays the Nazi card lightly, and Mrs. Reding is among the most media-savvy people in Brussels. Her reference appeared carefully calibrated &#8212; it&#8217;s in her prepared remarks &#8212; and it served its purpose. 

<p>France is left to sputter that its deportations aren&#8217;t as bad as the Nazis&#8217;, while Mrs. Reding&#8217;s point &#8212; that it&#8217;s plainly illegal to select deportees by race &#8212; is left largely unchallenged. 

<p>And by making the remark two days before the summit, Mrs. Reding all but guarantees that Mr. Sarkozy himself will have to address it if he holds his customary press conference this afternoon. 

<p>Stay tuned.

<p>The camps should be dismantled. I have seen them, they are illegal and filthy! I would get a ticket if I would pitch my tent in the Central Park in NYC. I would probably go to jail if I would resist the law. The same would happen to me in any European park. Why should they be treated differently? The law is equal for everybody &#8211; also for the minorities. This doesn&#8217;t mean they need to be deported. That&#8217;s a different matter. They should be treated like anybody else. Get a ticket and if they don&#8217;t pay go to jail.

<p>The Roma should just declare war on France!   I&#8217;m sure the French would surrender without a real fight.   The French would surrender to a minefield! 

<p>So Nellie: Are the Roma supposed to go back to their native land, in the Indus Valley, where they were persecuted and driven from their land by the Muslim Hordes of Afganistan over 1000 years ago?

<p>I tend to agree with Galicija. Why are these people in France breaking French laws and living like degenerate filthy pigs? They should stay in their native lands. Returning people to their nations is not the equivalent to sending them to death chambers, more&#8217;s the pity! They are like insects&#8211;you keep swatting them away, but they keep coming back. So, good luck trying to get rid of them by deporting them and giving them money. They will be back by bus within days. lol

<p>EU Citizenship: The Treaty of Maastricht states that 

<p> Every person holding the nationality of a Member State of the European Union   is, as a result, a citizen of the Union. Citizenship of the Union supplements   national citizenship without replacing it. It is made up of a set of fundamental   rights and obligations enshrined in the EC Treaty among which it is worth   underlining the right not to be discriminated on the basis of the nationality..
