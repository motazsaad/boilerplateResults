<p>Mother Jones offers a great graphic that answers the question “Is your team’s owner a ‘Major League A-hole?”; Mark Bittman has a great New York Times piece about the healthy fast food movement; and BuzzFeed has a great list out telling you who the hottest attorneys general are.

<p>1.  Following a ruling that determined the New York Yankees baseball team has the exclusive rights to the phrase &#8220;Baseball&#8217;s Evil Empire,&#8221;   Mother Jones   undertook the admirable effort to document the owners of all major league baseball teams, which resulted in &#8220;  Is Your Team&#8217;s Owner a Major League Asshole?  &#8221; The matrix makes the Yankees, in spite of their trademark, look like kittens.  Thanks to Twitter fan Jennie Brand who pointed us to this. 

<p>2.   New York Times   writer Mark Bittman, in his   latest column  , has documented the efforts of small fast food chains to offer their customers healthy, humane, and cheap food.
