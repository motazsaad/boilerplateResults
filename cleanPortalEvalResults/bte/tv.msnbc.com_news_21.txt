<p>Margaret Spellings, the former Secretary of Education under George W. Bush, and L.A. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa join The Daily Rundown’s Chuck Todd to talk about teacher unions, charter schools versus public schools, and investing in education and teachers. 

<p>The Chicago Teacher Union strike only came to an end last week, but it has left many asking questions. People are wondering if teacher unions are to blame for slow education reform, or if they are a solution to a bigger problem. 

<p>On today&#8217;s show, Chuck asked both Margaret Spellings, the former Secretary of Education under George W.  Bush, and L.A. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa if teacher unions are to blame for slow education reform. Hear what they had to say below.

<p>And don&#8217;t miss the Today Show&#8217;s interview with President Obama. Co-anchor Savannah Guthrie asked President Obama the same question on teacher unions in an interview over the weekend. The President responded by saying he gets frustrated when he hears teacher bashing. 

<p>&#8220;You know, I just really get frustrated when I hear  teacher-bashing as evidence of reform,&#8221; Obama said. 

<p>He went on to say, &#8220;What is absolutely true is if we&#8217;ve  got a bad teacher, we should be able to train them to get better, and if  they can&#8217;t get better, they should be able to get fired.&#8221;
