<p>The New York Times is getting in the haiku business, imaging the Keystone XL Pipeline as a bike path, and the Boston police department is going undercover online to stop the city’s biggest threat: DIY indie-rock shows. 

<p>The   All In with Chris Hayes   team puts out a daily call to the Twitter and Facebook communities for the &#8220;awesomest things&#8221; they encountered on the Internet. 

<p>1.  With the advent of their new on-line project, &#8220;  Times Haiku  ,&#8221; The   New York Times   shows us that reading the news can be a doubly enriching experience. Watch Chris as he recites his favorites. 

<p>2.  Remember the   cop who   tried   to infiltrate Occupy Wall Street masquerading as a hipster  ? Well there&#8217;s a digital incarnation of &#8220;Hipster Cop&#8221; trying to gain inside access to Boston&#8217;s DIY Indie-Rock scene. Thanks to Twitter fan,   Shaleen Title  , for tipping us off to this droll news item. 

<p>@  chrislhayes   These Boston cops pretending to be &#8220;punks&#8221; was funniest thing I&#8217;ve seen in a while   slate.com/articles/news_…  #click3

<p>3.  Did you know host of   All In with Chris Hayes   is a big   proponent of biking  ? He is. When Twitter fan,   Matt Moffat,   submitted   one designer&#8217;s   mock-ups of what the Keystone XL Pipeline would look like as a transnational bike path, Chris   spun a wheelie  . 

<p>@  allinwithchris   great show last night. awesome format. looking forward to seeing how the show evolves and grows @  chrislhayes
