<p>  Games and puzzles offerings expand for Washington Post readers 

<p> By    Washington Post Editors 

<p>We&rsquo;re pleased to announce that we&rsquo;re expanding our entertainment offerings with the launch of   WP Games  . This new section of our Web site, at   games.washingtonpost.com  , will offer dozens of interactive games, puzzles and quizzes. Best of all? Playing won&rsquo;t cost you a dime. 

<p>  Our roster of offerings includes arcade games, word games, card games and strategy puzzles. Like letters? Race the clock to form words with   Spellbound  . Got an eye for detail? Match tiles in   Mahjongg   or hunt through a   Word Search  . The visually inclined can try a Jigsaw, while card fans can play   Spider Solitaire   and   Pool  .  

<p>And the favorites you&rsquo;ve played on washingtonpost.com for years are still here:   Crickler  ,   Sudoku   and our three popular puzzles &mdash; the   Daily Crossword   from Bob Klahn and CrosSynergy; the   Sunday Crossword   by Merl Reagle; and the   Post Puzzler   from Peter Gordon and Fireball Crosswords. 

<p>Our new interactive offerings are the work of online games developer Arkadium. They&rsquo;re all Flash-based, so you&rsquo;ll need to be sure you&rsquo;ve installed and updated your   Adobe Flash Player   before you get started. If you need assistance along the way, check out our   Help page   or   FAQs  . 

<p>Each game is free. Many can be printed to take on the road with you. And we&rsquo;re looking forward to making them accessible to mobile devices in the future. 

<p>We hope you&rsquo;ll have fun exploring this new section. Ready to play?   Game on  .
