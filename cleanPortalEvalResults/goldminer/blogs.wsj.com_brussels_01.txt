<p>As often in oil-producing countries, Azerbaijan&#8217;s oil dollars
 have been converted into real estate and luxury cars and,
 according to western diplomats, have largely benefited a small
 elite. In Baku, glassy five-star hotels and office buildings mirror
 beautifully renovated palaces from the capital&#8217;s first oil
 boom, which spanned the 19th and 20th centuries, and a shabby,
 Soviet-style Caspian shoreline has been turned into a shiny boulevard.

<p>However, some changes are less evident to the visitor. Compared with
 17 years ago, when major oil companies negotiated the oil deals
 that have brought Azerbaijan its riches,  Azerbaijan has developed
 a group of much more sophisticated negotiators now that it
 is being wooed by European buyers of its natural gas, as we
 report today.

<p>In 1994, when the country signed its first modern contracts giving
 oil majors the right to exploit its fields &#8211;referred to in
 Azerbaijan as &#8220;the contract of the century&#8221;&#8211;
 foreign oil majors had a big influence and a prominent role in
 the decisions.

<p>Now, the country is in a much better position to play its cards in
 deciding its future, namely on the upcoming sale of major natural
 gas volumes, where Socar, the country&#8217;s state oil company,
 plays a leading role, experts say.

<p>In spite of Socar&#8217;s 10% stake in the second phase of Shah
 Deniz, the gas field that will provide the first gas for Europe
 &#8211;compared with BP and Statoil&#8217;s 25.5% each&#8211; the
 company, which effectively representing the Azeri government, has a
 key role in making the final sale decision.

<p>A generational change has brought into top positions highly and
 &#8211;increasingly western&#8211; educated people that are now
 forming the backbone of the administration. This created a group
 of officials that can crunch numbers and run models independently
 from the input of foreign companies, and that at the same time
 has a more modern view of the negotiating process, observers say.

<p>This is giving Socar and the country&#8217;s government a stronger
 sense of confidence in the talks, Mr. Chow explains: &#8220;Today,
 you&#8217;re just in a different place both objectively and
 subjectively than you were in 10 years ago,&#8221; when Azerbaijan
 negotiated its first gas sales to Turkey.

<p>Ten years ago, the country was still heavily dependent on foreigners:
 even the interpreter of one of the lead negotiators was a BP
 employee, a person involved in the talks at the time remembers.

<p>It remains to be seen if Socar&#8217;s &#8211;and
 Azerbaijan&#8217;s&#8211; increased self confidence and the
 improvement in the training of its officials will pay off in
 leading the country to strike a profitable deal with European companies.

<p>Timing is far from certain in gas politics, but there&#8217;s a good
 chance will will have a better idea before the year&#8217;s end.
