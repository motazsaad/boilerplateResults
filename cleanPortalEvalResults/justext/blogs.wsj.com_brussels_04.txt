<p>U.S. ambassador Howard W. Gutman is something of a celebrity in
 Belgium, thanks to his plan to visit every single one of the
 country’s 589 towns. While the chocolate-box charms of Bruges,
 Ghent and Antwerp are well known, he’s been going further afield
 as well.

<p>Early in his tour, he went to Charleroi in the country’s
 French-speaking south. Best known for its post-industrial decline
 – a phenomenon shared with its twin city of Pittsburgh – the
 ambassador was keen to see another side of the city, including
 the largest photography museum in Europe, which has an impressive
 collection of iconic photos from the U.S.

<p>“He came to visit and met students, answered all their questions,
 even controversial ones about Iraq and Israel, and it was a huge
 PR boost for the town, in particular the photography museum,”
 Antoine Tanzilli, the head of tourism at Charleroi’s city hall
 recalls. “I was really stunned by the size of his security
 operation, he had much more security than the King when he came
 to visit.”

<p>His grand tour has so far included the Lotus bakeries biscuit
 factory, Mardi Gras in Malmedy, and several breweries – as well
 as AB-InBev he’s been to a host of smaller ones including
 Bosteels, home of Tripel Karmeliet (brewed by nuns as opposed to
 monks) and even Westvleteren, home of the extremely rare, very
 delicious brew of the same name.

<p>Just before Christmas, Gutman went to Bastogne, scene of one of the
 U.S. Army’s bloodiest battles in World War II. He joined
 dignitaries, and the last couple to married there that year, on
 the town hall balcony to throw walnuts at the crowd in a
 ceremony with disputed roots – some believe it has existed since
 medieval times, while others say it’s based on General
 McAuliffe&#8217;s response of &#8220;Nuts!&#8221; a Nazi demand for
 surrender during the the battle.

<p>“He came on the walk of remembrance round the memorial site,
 it’s not the first time he’s joined us for the ceremony,”
 Jocelyne Olivier, the town councilor responsible for the event
 says. “His nut-throwing technique gets better every year. He said
 he’d been taking baseball lessons&#8211;they went very far indeed!”

<p>His fondness for the country where President Barack Obama posted him
 is reflected in his quirky approach to speechwriting. “If Barack
 Obama Were A Country, He’d Be Belgium,” he said recently.
 “And as with Barack Obama, when you are discussing Belgian
 creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship, you need note only
 &#8220;Yes We Can.&#8217;&#8221;

<l>I read the article about Ambassador Gutman and Belgium. Great. Glad
 he is criss-crossing the country to spread good will, represent
 our great country and most importantly to gain an understanding of
 Belgium culture. I am however, surprised there is no mention of
 Belgium&#8217;s standing as the world mecca of cyclocross racing.
 The country&#8217;s biggest and most passionate fan population is
 devoted to this sport. Cyclocross races are covered on live TV
 every weekend and the results of the racing are the first story
 in the sporting news. Belgium cyclocross riders make up the bulk
 of the world&#8217;s best riders in the sport. There are very
 passionate and devout cyclocross riders in small pockets in the
 U.S.A., notably in the Northeast but it is a niche sport here
 whereas cyclocross is an integral part of cycling-crazy,
 Belgium&#8217;s culture. I do hope Ambassador Gutman will take in
 a cyclocross race (maybe even throw a leg over the saddle?) to
 gain a greater perspective of what Belgium has to offer to the
 world, besides good beer.

<l>I commend him for his efforts.
 The title incorrectly states he&#8217;s Belgium&#8217;s ambassador
 when he&#8217;s actually America&#8217;s ambassador.
 I&#8217;ve heard from people inside the government that he was a
 bit &#8220;high maintenance&#8221; &#8211; e.g., what he expected in
 the line of housing and what would be spent on upkeep was high.
 Appalling about the security. No wonder the USG&#8217;s debt is so
 high. No doubt there are people in the world who would like to
 see Americans dead but more security than the king? How credible
 is an assumption that the ambassador to Belgium is high on
 someone&#8217;s target list. Home of the brave, not the excessively protected.

<l>As a long-time American resident in Belgium, I can confirm that
 Ambassador Howard Gutman is highly visable in this country
 spreading good will and understanding for his country. The fact
 that he has learned both Dutch and French helps him in his many
 public appearances and media events. In addition, the ambassador is
 available 24/7 (seems he never sleeps) to support other good-will
 ambassadors from the US, including an active group of US students
 enrolled at many of Belgium&#8217;s exellent universities and
 colleges. Hope he keeps up the good work for a long time to come.
