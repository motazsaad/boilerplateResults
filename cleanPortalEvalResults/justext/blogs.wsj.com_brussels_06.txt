<p>These signs were hanging from parliament members’ door handles in
 Strasbourg. They were put there by the International Paper Co.,
 which said it agreed with the climate-change fighting scheme, but
 not the proposed fix intended to raise carbon emission prices.

<p>European Parliament was gearing up to vote Wednesday on whether to
 rejuvenate, or let lie fallow, its flagship climate-change fighting
 policy, the Emissions Trading System.

<p>Shortly beforehand, the outcome remained too close to call with any
 definitive certainty. Again. The legislation is a compromise on
 what parliament very narrowly shot down in April.

<p>For those members of parliament having difficulties making the
 decision this time around, there was no shortage of opinions being pushed.

<p>MEPs, by all accounts all 766 of them, showed up to the office
 Monday with a hotel-style sign hanging from their office door
 handles by International Paper Co.  &#8220;Do as you are
 told!&#8221; said the tear-drop sign featuring a full mug shot of
 Connie Hedegaard, European commissioner for climate action.

<p>&#8220;The Climate Action Commissioner refused to accept your
 democratic decision and is now telling you to compromise your
 principles,&#8221; it said. &#8220;The choice is clear. Vote NO
 again to preserve your political credibility.&#8221;

<p>The effort was condemned by Matthias Groote, MEP in the Social
 Democratic party who heads the parliament&#8217;s environment
 committee. &#8220;I&#8217;m okay with lobbying,&#8221; Mr. Groote
 said. &#8220;Everybody has a right to share their opinions.
 It&#8217;s part of the democratic process.&#8221;

<p>&#8220;But this is not fair. We work very hard. To simplify it like
 this is a lie,&#8221; Mr. Groote said.

<p>An International Paper spokesman said the company supports the ETS
 scheme, just not the proposed fix.

<p>The proposal, known as backloading, is intended to lift the cost of
 emitting carbon-dioxide, which collapsed alongside the drop in
 demand for electricity during the economic downturn. The lack of
 industrial activity resulted in too many carbon permits in the
 market. The new rules would temporarily reduce this oversupply.

<p>The higher prices anticipated from this could help reintroduce
 incentives for cutting the use of fossil fuels and developing
 renewable technologies.

<p>But the fix is technical and not easy to understand. Analysts have
 said it probably won&#8217;t raise carbon prices enough to have an
 impact. Yet without this attempt at reform, the EU&#8217;s carbon
 market will almost certainly fall into obscurity, while California,
 Australia, and even China race ahead with their own carbon markets.

<p>So just how close will this vote be? About as close as the last
 one. In April parliament voted 334 to 315, with 63 abstentions.

<p>This was so close for a parliamentary vote that the a whole host
 of variables could have shifted it, including nothing to due with
 climate or industry at all, said Jerzy Buzek, EPP member and
 former prime minister of Poland, who is against backloading.

<p>The vote in April &#8220;was just one day before the funeral of
 Margaret Thatcher,&#8221; Mr. Buzek said, adding that if it had
 been &#8220;on the day of the funeral, backloading would have been
 approved. All the conservatives would have gone to London, and the
 result would have been quite opposite.&#8221;

<p>With no major state funerals scheduled for Wednesday, expect this to
 go to the wire.

<l>It&#8217;s &#8220;talk&#8221; about the weather; Again!
 Has anyone noticed; The Hubble telescope has scanned the heavens
 and &#8220;looked&#8217; back light-years into our past?
 Thousands and more &#8220;pictures&#8221; of far-out galaxies!
 Most of what is presented; is History!
 BUT; have you noticed; NOT ONE picture has located ANOTHER
 &#8220;BLUE&#8221; planet!
 A &#8220;blue&#8221; planet; is one with an atmosphere!
 The &#8220;atmosphere&#8221;; is the protection from the deadly rays
 from the Sun!
 &#8220;Visiting other worlds&#8221; will only be done by Robots!
 The Sun&#8217;s rays change some of the Oxygen atoms into Ozone,
 which in turn adds another layer of protection. This Ozone layer;
 is above our Stratosphere!
 There has been &#8220;talk&#8221; about global warming, and this
 has had the effect of concern about CO2 emissions, and the effect
 on our climate! We completely dis-regard the effect of Jet Plane exhausts!
 OH! There have been improvements, and except for the
 &#8220;jet-trails&#8221;; we have become comfortable with traveling
 by Jet; all over our planet!
 What is the point?
 Simple!
 Where is the exhaust from these jets; Going?
 Every hour of every day; TONS of jet exhaust is being dumped
 into our Stratosphere!
 Does anyone wonder about the effect of these exhausts?
 The &#8220;rays&#8221; from our Sun, have no effect on anything;
 UNTIL they encounter any matter!
 Our stratosphere is &#8220;matter&#8221;
 Can anyone think of something we can do to &#8220;protect&#8221;
 our Planet?
 Coming back down to earth; let&#8217;s get the Fair Tax bill
 passed; and then we can tackle the Stratosphere Problem!
