<p>A Roma woman with a child passes a logo of the European Commission
 in Brussels.

<p>Not literally. But fur is flying between France and the European
 Commission, which in the person of Justice Commissioner Viviane
 Reding this week strongly condemned the ongoing French campaign to
 deport Gypsies (also known as Roma).

<p>The Roma issue is creeping into today&#8217;s EU summit, which is
 supposed to be about foreign policy.

<p>French officials have lined up to denounce Mrs. Reding&#8217;s
 denunciation. They&#8217;ve directed their ire at her remark that
 forced removal on the basis of ethnicity &#8220;is a situation I
 would have thought Europe would not have to witness again after
 the Second World War.&#8221;

<p>French President Nicolas Sarkozy&#8217;s office yesterday put out a
 brief statement deeming the comments &#8220;outrageous.&#8221; Prime
 Minister François Fillon stacked up a trio of adjectives:
 &#8220;implausible, unimaginable, scandalous.&#8221; Even German
 Chancellor Angela Merkel weighed in Wednesday night, calling the
 comparison &#8220;unsuitable.&#8221;

<p>Mr. Sarkozy has an ally in Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi, and
 the two appear determined to bring a discussion of Gypsies to the summit.

<p>Mrs. Reding backed off the World War II reference last night, but
 she nonetheless appears to have outmaneuvered France.

<p>No European commissioner &#8212; indeed, no European politician &#8212;
 plays the Nazi card lightly, and Mrs. Reding is among the most
 media-savvy people in Brussels. Her reference appeared carefully
 calibrated &#8212; it&#8217;s in her prepared remarks &#8212; and
 it served its purpose.

<p>France is left to sputter that its deportations aren&#8217;t as bad
 as the Nazis&#8217;, while Mrs. Reding&#8217;s point &#8212; that
 it&#8217;s plainly illegal to select deportees by race &#8212; is
 left largely unchallenged.

<p>And by making the remark two days before the summit, Mrs. Reding
 all but guarantees that Mr. Sarkozy himself will have to address
 it if he holds his customary press conference this afternoon.

<l>The camps should be dismantled. I have seen them, they are illegal
 and filthy! I would get a ticket if I would pitch my tent in
 the Central Park in NYC. I would probably go to jail if I would
 resist the law. The same would happen to me in any European
 park. Why should they be treated differently? The law is equal
 for everybody &#8211; also for the minorities. This doesn&#8217;t
 mean they need to be deported. That&#8217;s a different matter.
 They should be treated like anybody else. Get a ticket and if
 they don&#8217;t pay go to jail.

<l>The Roma should just declare war on France!
 I&#8217;m sure the French would surrender without a real fight.
 The French would surrender to a minefield!

<l>So Nellie: Are the Roma supposed to go back to their native land,
 in the Indus Valley, where they were persecuted and driven from
 their land by the Muslim Hordes of Afganistan over 1000 years ago?

<l>I tend to agree with Galicija. Why are these people in France
 breaking French laws and living like degenerate filthy pigs? They
 should stay in their native lands. Returning people to their
 nations is not the equivalent to sending them to death chambers,
 more&#8217;s the pity! They are like insects&#8211;you keep swatting
 them away, but they keep coming back. So, good luck trying to
 get rid of them by deporting them and giving them money. They
 will be back by bus within days. lol

<l>EU Citizenship: The Treaty of Maastricht states that

<l> Every person holding the nationality of a Member State of the
 European Union
 is, as a result, a citizen of the Union. Citizenship of the
 Union supplements
 national citizenship without replacing it. It is made up of a set

 rights and obligations enshrined in the EC Treaty among which it
 is worth
 underlining the right not to be discriminated on the basis of the nationality..
