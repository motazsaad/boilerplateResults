<h>SEC may require more disclosure from corporations

<p>If there&#039;s one thing we learned from the 2012 election,
 it&#039;s that the already gigantic role that money plays in
 politics is only expanding. Bloomberg View’s Josh Barro, Occupy
 Wall Street activist Alexis Goldstein, Demos’ Liz Kennedy, and
 Jesse Eisinger from ProPublica join Steve Kornacki to talk about
 the campaign finance and forcing public companies to disclose
 political donations.

<p>Nearly a half a million people have signed a petition urging the
 SEC to require greater disclosure from corporations about their
 political donations. On Sunday&#8217;s Up with Steve Kornacki, the
 panel discussed the effect the rule might have, its potential
 benefits and drawbacks, and the broader question of how the SEC
 can (and if it can) regulate money in politics.

<p>As the New York Timesreported on Tuesday, a broad coalition of
 activists, Democratic officials, and other interested parties has
 formed to pressure the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to
 create a new rule that would require publicly traded corporations
 to disclose its political expenditures to its shareholders. It is
 possible to comment directly the SEC and add your opinion to the
 discussion. How does one do it?

<p>If you want to add your voice to the conversation about regulating
 money in politics, corporate speech, and government regulation, read

 Steve Kornacki, and send an email to rule-comments@sec.gov with the
 subject: “Comment on File Number 4-637” and add your thoughts.
